# TechnoSutra AR - Project Roadmap

## Executive Summary

TechnoSutra is an innovative project that bridges ancient Buddhist wisdom with modern technology, creating an immersive augmented reality (AR) experience based on the 56 chapters of the Avatamsaka Sutra (Gandavyuha Sutra). The project enables users to explore Buddhist teachings through 3D models, interactive AR experiences, and a digital pilgrimage route that can be replicated anywhere in the world.

The project has successfully completed its initial development phase, creating a complete web-based AR platform with 56 interactive 3D models, a comprehensive database of characters and chapters, and a replicable QR code system for creating physical pilgrimage routes.
