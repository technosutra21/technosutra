Chapter 2
SAMANTA BHADRA
2. 1
Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samanta bhadra looked upon the great
assembly of bodhisattvas, and in order to categorize, teach extensively,
clarify, illuminate, and give instructions on the Tathāgata’s samādhi called
the gaping lion, he taught those bodhisattvas in ten ways the Tathāgata’s
samādhi called the gaping lion through the equality of the nature of the realm
of phenomena with the element of space, the equality of the three times, the
equality of the realm of phenomena, the equality of the realms of beings, the
equality of all worlds, the equality of the continuum of karma, the equality of
the thoughts of all beings, the equality of the aspirations of beings, the
equality of the appearances of phenomena, the equality of the times for
ripening beings, and the equality of the faculties of all beings. [F.301.b]
2. 2
What were those ten ways?
1. The teaching of the entire succession of buddhas and succession of
buddha realms
 in the atoms of all the buddha realms that are included
within the entire realm of phenomena.
180
2. 3
2. The teaching of describing the qualities of a tathāgata until the end of
future kalpas in all the buddha realms to the ends of the element of space.
2. 4
3. The teaching that describes the appearance of tathāgatas in all the
buddha realms and the ocean of gateways to enlightenment that have no
middle or edge.
2. 5
4. The teaching of the saṅghas of bodhisattvas, the circles of the
assemblies of the tathāgatas, who are facing the bodhimaṇḍas
 in all the
buddha realms to the ends of the element of space.
181
2. 6
5. The teaching of emanations that are like the bodies of the buddhas of
the three times that are emanated from all the pores in one instant of mind
and pervade the realm of phenomena.

2. 7
6. The teaching of the ocean of buddha realms in the ocean of directions
being blessed as having the same ground and having one body pervading
them.
2. 8
7. The teaching of the power of buddha manifestations appearing on all
supporting surfaces
 in all three times.
182
2. 9
8. The teaching of the manifestations of the buddhas in the succession of
realms, as numerous as the atoms of all realms,
 throughout the three times
in an ocean of kalpas.
183
2. 10
9. The teaching of the power of an entire ocean of the prayers of the
buddhas of the three times being expressed from all pores and causing the
appearance of bodhisattvas.
2. 11
10. The teaching of the power of buddhas, lion thrones, [F.302.a]
assembled circles of bodhisattvas, the adornment of the bodhimaṇḍa, and
the turning of the different Dharma wheels being as extensive as the realm of
phenomena.
2. 12
“Oh jinaputras, the teachings on this samādhi of the gaping lion, such as
these ten teachings, are as numerous as the atoms in uncountable buddha
realms.
“Oh jinaputras, that is the field of activity of the wisdom of the
tathāgatas.”
2. 13
The bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, in order to teach an aspect of the
meaning of the Tathāgata’s samādhi of the gaping lion, through the blessing
of the Buddha looked upon the Tathāgata’s face, looked upon the ocean of
the circle of the assembly, looked upon the inconceivable field of activity of
the Buddha and the manifestations of the Tathāgata’s samādhi, which have
no center or limit, looked at his entry into inconceivable numbers of world
realms, looked at the nature of the illusory manifestations of inconceivable
wisdom, looked upon the inconceivable equality of the buddhas of the three
times, looked upon all his speech, definitions, and ways of the Dharma,
which have no center or limit, and recited these verses:
2. 14
“On each body hair there is an ocean of the realms of jinas184
As numerous as the atoms in all realms.
There,
 buddhas are seated on their buddha thrones,
185
Surrounded by assemblies of bodhisattvas. {1}
2. 15
“There appears an ocean of many realms on each body hair,
In each of which appears a guide at the foot of the supreme tree,
Seated upon a lotus seat on the bodhimaṇḍa,
Filling the vastness of the realm of phenomena. {2} [F.302.b]
2. 16
“On each single body hair reside jinas


---

As numerous as the atoms in all the realms.
They are encircled by assemblies of bodhisattvas
And all teaching good conduct. {3}
2. 17
“A jina resides in each supreme realm
With as many unending clouds of bodhisattvas,
Who filled all infinite realms, having come
From all of the ten directions without exception. {4}
2. 18
“Bodhisattvas, shining with an ocean of qualities,
As numerous as the atoms in ten million realms,
Who filled the realm of phenomena’s ten directions,
Have all appeared as the assembly of the teachers. {5}
2. 19
“Throughout all realms appear the images
Of an ocean of the kings of Dharma, the wisdom of the jinas.
All who are maintaining good conduct
Have come to be the assemblies of all the buddhas. {6}
2. 20
“Those who maintain the delightful conduct of bodhisattvas,186
Who dwell throughout all infinite realms,
Those heroes who listen to clouds of the Dharma,
Practice that conduct for ten million kalpas in each realm. {7}
2. 21
“The bodhisattvas who are practicing their conduct
Are radiant with the practice of an ocean
 of Dharma.
187
They engage in the entire ocean of prayers
And remain within the field of conduct of buddhahood. {8}
2. 22
“They who have originated from this and that Dharma of the jinas
Have the knowledge of completely good conduct.
They enter into the extensive miraculous appearance
Of oceans of the excellent qualities of the buddhas.
 {9}
188
2. 23
“The sugatas
 pervade the entirety of the realm of phenomena,
189
Continuously emanating clouds of bodies
As numerous as the atoms in all realms,
Bringing a rain of Dharma that leads to enlightenment.” {10} [B26]
2. 24
Then the Bhagavat, in order to further
 establish those bodhisattvas in this
samādhi of the gaping lion, [F.303.a] emanated from the ūrṇā hair between his
eyebrows a great ray of light called illumination of the three times focused on all
the entrances into the realm of the Dharma, and he was accompanied by an
190


---

entourage of light rays as numerous as the atoms in countless buddha
realms. They illuminated all the infinite buddha realms in all the oceans of
world realms in the ten directions.
2. 25
Then those bodhisattvas who were assembled in Jetavana saw all the
buddha realms that were included within the realm of phenomena, which
extended to the limits of space, and the buddha realms that were in the
atoms of all buddha realms that were as numerous
 as the atoms in all
buddha realms. In these buddha realms, which had different names and
colors,
 different levels of purification, different kinds of grounds,
 and
different kinds of appearances, there were those who had come to a
bodhimaṇḍa, were seated upon a bodhisattva’s lion throne, were being
offered to by the lords of the world, and were encircled by a supreme
assembly of bodhisattvas and were attaining the highest, complete
enlightenment of buddhahood.
191
192
193
2. 26
They saw in countless buddha realms some who were turning the wheel
of the Dharma with an extent of speech that filled the vastness of the realm
of phenomena. They saw some who were in the abodes of the devas; some
who were in the abodes of the nāgas; some who were in the abodes of the
yakṣas; some who were in the abodes of the asuras; some who were in the
abodes of the garuḍas; some who were in the abodes of the kinnaras; some
who were in the abodes of the mahoragas; some who were in the abodes of
lords of humans; some who were in the villages, towns, market towns,
districts, countries, and capitals in the world of humans; [F.303.b] with
various miraculous powers, various conducts, various bodies; demonstrating
various entrances to samādhi; with the various clairvoyances of samādhi;
appearing in various families and castes; manifesting various colors; having
various kinds of asuras; emanating various networks of light rays; having
various extents of voice, various humans that are being spoken to, and
various audiences for their teaching; and teaching the Dharma to the
gathered assemblies with various words, expressions,
 and definitions.
194
2. 27
As many bodhisattvas as there were
 saw in each of those gathered
assemblies
 a tathāgata’s profound miracles from a buddha’s samādhi.
195
196
2. 28
They saw the arising of the images of the miracles of the samādhis of
tathāgatas in as many world realms as there are throughout the realm of
phenomena and as far as the limits of space, that are present in the ten
directions, that are all around in the infinite directions, that are in the entire
ocean of directions, that are in the directions
 of various gateways into the
Dharma, that are conceived to be in the various directions, that are
assembled in the various directions, that are divided among the various
directions, that belong to the various directions, that are included within the
ocean of the various directions, which means in the eastern direction, in the
197


---

southern direction, in the western direction, in the northern direction, in the
northeastern direction, in the southeastern direction, in the southwestern
direction, in the northwestern direction, in the upward direction and the
downward direction, in the directions of groups of realms, in the directions
of groups
 of beings, in the directions of the conceived categories
 of
beings, in the directions of the furthest past, in the ten directions of the
present, in the directions that are focused on a very fine hair tip located
within the entire expanse of space, in the directions of the succession of
atoms in all realms,
 in the directions that are included within directions, in
the directions where the creation of various kinds of karma is accomplished,
[F.304.a] in the directions where space, which has no middle or edge, is
perceived as being in a single hair tip,
 in the minds of beings where the
three times are united in the state of equality and all beings are within a state
of equality, where there is no differentiation between the perceptions of all
beings, and where there is the equality of all sounds. They saw within the
groups
 of beings the approach of the forms of the tathāgatas before the
assemblies that directly perceive them. They saw the sameness of wisdom
within all kalpas. They saw in all the realms how equally everywhere there
was the perception of the appearance before them of the forms of the
tathāgatas in accordance with the aspirations of all beings. They saw their
teaching of all the Dharmas of the buddhas so that there was a continuous
guiding of all beings. They saw the miraculous activities of the tathāgatas.

2. 29
The Bhagavat Vairocana, through the four methods of gathering pupils
and through their corresponding previous practice of good actions, had
adopted all of them as pupils. They were ripened through teaching,
hearing,
 remembering, and reverence.
203
2. 30
They had in the past developed the aspiration to attain the highest
supreme enlightenment. When they had come before this and that tathāgata,
they had been adopted as their pupils because of their roots of merit.
2. 31
In that way, through having the corresponding roots of merit and because
they were adopted as pupils through the methods of ripening them for
omniscience, they saw and perceived the miracles of the samādhi of the
Bhagavat Vairocana, which are vast, extending to the limits of space. Some
perceived the Dharma body. [F.304.b] Some perceived the form body. Some
perceived his past bodhisattva accomplishment. Some perceived his
completion of the perfections. Some perceived the display of his pure field of
conduct. Some perceived the miracles of the bodhisattva level. Some
perceived the miracles of enlightenment. Some perceived miracles that were
not different from the samādhi practiced by a buddha. Some perceived the
strengths and fearlessnesses of the tathāgatas. Some perceived the ocean of
the realization of a buddha, and so on, perceiving an ocean of a buddha’s

miracles as numerous as the incalculable number of atoms in ten buddha
realms.
 They perceived an ocean of buddha miracles through various
aspirations, various paths, various gateways, various entries, various
ingresses, various ways, various observances, various directions, various
vessels, various regions, various worlds, various attainments, various
accumulations, various miracles, and various methods.

realm of phenomena. It was like this: in each instant of the mind there issued
forth vast clouds of networks of light rays that brought satisfaction to all
beings and pervaded the ten directions; there issued forth clouds of bells
made of a variety of precious materials, [F.310.b] from which resounded
praises of the qualities and excellences of all the tathāgatas in the three times
and which pervaded the ten directions; there issued forth from all sensory
objects clouds of the music of
 all beings that possessed the beautiful
sounds of the music of the ripening of the karma of all beings, and it
resounded and pervaded throughout the ten directions; there issued forth a
multitude of clouds that manifested all the ways of bodhisattva prayers and
the variety of bodhisattva conduct, and they pervaded throughout the ten
directions; they resounded with the sound of the prayers of all bodhisattvas
and pervaded throughout the ten directions; there issued forth a multitude
of clouds of the emanations and manifestations of all the tathāgatas,
speaking with the voices of all the tathāgatas, which pervaded throughout
the ten directions; there issued forth a multitude of clouds of the adorning
characteristics and features of the bodies of bodhisattvas, which described
the successive births of buddhas in all realms and pervaded throughout the
ten directions; there issued forth a multitude of clouds of the enlightenment
that is equally the essence of all the tathāgatas in the three times, and they
taught the appearance of the array of the attainment of buddhahood by all
the tathāgatas and pervaded throughout the ten directions; there issued
forth a multitude of clouds of the bodies of the lords of nāgas from all
sensory objects, which let fall a rain of various kinds of perfume and
pervaded throughout the ten directions; there issued forth a multitude of
clouds of bodies that resembled the lords of beings, described the completely
good bodhisattva conduct, [F.311.a] and pervaded the ten directions; there
issued forth a multitude of clouds of images of the pure realms that had the
nature of all precious materials, made visible the turning of the Dharma
wheel by all tathāgatas, and pervaded the ten directions; and there issued
forth other such clouds of vast arrays of miraculous manifestations as
numerous as the atoms in buddha realms beyond enumeration through the
transformative power of those bodhisattvas and from their nature of having
attained the radiance of an inconceivable ocean of qualities.

The bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, seeing in the ten directions all those
manifestations of miracles through the miraculous power of the Buddha,
recited these verses:
2. 40
“Observe the appearance of the vast, infinite,
Miraculous power of the Buddha in Jetavana.
There have issued forth from all sensory objects


---

Clouds of bodies that have pervaded all directions. {11}
2. 41
“The vast, completely pure, infinite forms
Of the various displays of the Sugata’s offspring
Are perceived as images appearing
From the thrones and from sensory objects. {12}
2. 42
“A variety of displays, clouds of jewel light rays,
From the tips of the body hairs of the sons of the sugatas
Are emanated, spreading within all the realms
And resounding with the words of the buddhas. {13}
2. 43
“Bodies that resemble the forms of Brahmakāyika devas
With pure bodies and peaceful conduct
Issue forth from the blossoms on the trees,254
Describing the aspects of dhyāna as they go. {14}
2. 44
“From the Sugata’s pores issue forth,
Without impediment, innumerable, countless emanations
Who are bodhisattvas that resemble Samanta bhadra,
Their bodies adorned by the characteristics and features. {15} [F.311.b]
2. 45
“The great ocean of the emanated qualities
Of the sugatas’ sons who have appeared in the three times,
Who are clouds of displays of an ocean of qualities,
Proclaim those who are seated in Jetavana.
 {16}
255
2. 46
“A vast ocean of the variety, without exception,
Of the karma of beings in all directions
Is proclaimed, issuing forth from within
The forms of the trees in Jetavana. {17}
2. 47
“The miracles in all the realms, without exception,
Of all the jinas who appear in the three times,
Appear as each and every sensory object
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms.
 {18}
256
2. 48
“Clouds of oceans of buddhas in the realms in the directions
Disseminate from each of their pore hairs,
In each instant, a variety of the abodes of buddhas,
Within which reside multitudes of clouds of buddhas. {19}
2. 49
“They pervade every direction, wherever there are beings,
And through skillful methods ripen those beings.
From their light there issue forth vast clouds


---

Of oceans of perfumes, light rays,
 and flowers. {20}
257
2. 50
“The precious divine palaces as immeasurable as space
Are beautified with every adornment without exception.
Those realms and their bodhimaṇḍas
Pervade every direction. {21}
2. 51
“The sugatas’ sons who appear in the three times
Purify the ocean of realms
Through the practice of completely good conduct,258
And their various displays, as limitless as beings, {22}
2. 52
“Fill all directions and the three times.
They have been purified in a great ocean of kalpas,
And they all appear like reflections
In the expanse of the sky above Jetavana.” {23}
2. 53
Those bodhisattvas were continuously illumined by the samādhi of the
Buddha. Each of those bodhisattvas had entered gateways of great
compassion as numerous as the atoms in innumerable buddha realms and
[F.312.a] brought even more benefit for beings. Resting in meditation in that
way there issued from each of their body hairs light rays as numerous as the
atoms in innumerable buddha realms, and from the tips of each of those light
rays there issued clouds of bodhisattvas’ emanations, emanated bodies that
resembled the bodies of the Indras of all worlds, bodies that looked upon all
beings and ripened all beings. Having issued forth, they pervaded the realm
of phenomena in all directions. They inspired all beings, ripened them, and
guided them.
2. 54
They inspired beings with the gateways that taught being reborn in
paradises after death; with the gateways that taught rebirth in all world
realms; with the gateways that taught the domain of bodhisattva conduct;
with the gateways that taught dreams, which were as numerous as the
atoms in innumerable buddha realms; with the gateways that arose from
aspirations of all bodhisattvas; with the gateways that shook the world
realms; with the gateways that taught the conduct of the perfection of
generosity; with the gateways that were dedicated to and accomplished the
qualities of all the tathāgatas; with the gateways that taught the perfection of
patience when one’s limbs and various body parts are cut off; with the
gateways that taught the perfection of diligence through the great miracles
of the bodhisattvas; with the gateways that described the dhyānas,
liberations, and samādhis of the bodhisattvas and the radiance of the domain
that is the path of the wisdom of the buddhas; with the gateways that taught
the sacrificing of countless bodies for the sake of seeking all the Dharmas of

the buddhas [F.312.b] and for the sake of each word and letter of the Dharma;
with the gateways of going into the presence of all the tathāgatas and
asking questions concerning all the Dharmas; with the gateways of being
focused on the radiance of an ocean of the ways of attaining going into the
presence of beings when the time is right and, in accordance with their
aspirations, ripening them for omniscience; with the gateways that teach the
victory banner of the power of the invincibility of the merit and wisdom of
bodhisattvas in the face of māras and adversaries; with the gateways that
teach the level
 of the wisdom that has knowledge and understanding of
all crafts; with the gateways that teach the level
 of knowledge and
understanding that is superior to that of all beings; with the gateways that
teach the level
 of the wisdom that has the knowledge and understanding
of the different aspirations of all beings; with the gateways that teach the
level
 of the wisdom that has the knowledge and understanding of the
capabilities, entrances, engagements, and various kleśas and predispositions
of all beings;
 and with the gateways that teach the level of the wisdom
that has the knowledge and understanding of the variety of karma and
practices of all beings.
 With other such gateways as numerous as the
atoms in innumerable buddha realms that contained methods for ripening
and guiding beings, those bodhisattvas went to the abodes of all beings and
appeared there. Some went to the abodes of devas and appeared there. Some
went to the abodes of nāgas and appeared there. Some went to the abodes of
yakṣas and appeared there. Some went to the abodes of gandharvas and
appeared there. Some went to the abodes of asuras and appeared there.
Some went to the abodes of garuḍas and appeared there. Some went to the
abodes of kinnaras and appeared there. Some went to the abodes of
mahoragas and appeared there. Some went to the abodes of the lords of
Brahmā deities and appeared there. [F.313.a] Some went to the abodes of
humans and appeared there. Some went to the realms
 of Yamas and
appeared there. Some went to all the abodes of pretas and appeared there.
Some went to the worlds of the hells and appeared there. Some went to
births as animals
 and appeared there.

In order to ripen and guide with undivided great compassion, with
undivided aspiration, with undivided wisdom, with an undivided attraction
of beings, and in accordance with the aspirations of beings, those beings
who are guided by seeing them, guided by hearing them, guided by
remembering them, guided by the scope of their voices, guided by the sound
of the river of their names, guided by their halos, or guided by their
emanating a net of light rays —those bodhisattvas in Jetavana filled with an
array of various emanations the entire extent of world realms and the entire
extent of the realms of beings without moving from the feet of the Tathāgata.

Some made their own dwellings, kūṭāgāras, thrones, and retinues appear
throughout the ten directions without moving from the feet of the Tathāgata.
Some sent forth clouds of emanations, while some appeared to go alone,
with no companion, in order to ripen beings, without moving from the circle
of the Tathāgata’s entourage. Some appeared in the form of śramaṇas, some
in the form of Brahmās, some in the form of those adorned all over with all
emblems,
 some in the form of physicians, some in the form of merchants,
some in the form of disciples, [F.313.b] some in the form of dancers, some in
the form of devotees to deities, and some in the form of those skilled in all
crafts, all of them appearing in villages, towns, market towns, regions, and
capitals. They appeared at the times that were the appropriate times,
assuming different appropriate bodies, with different colors and body
shapes, different voices, different languages, different kinds of conduct, and
different kinds of residence. They practiced the bodhisattva conduct in
which all beings are known to be illusions, which illuminated the entire
realm of crafts, which was a bright lamp that revealed the knowledge of all
beings, which was adorned with the blessing of all truths,
 which had the
light that illuminated all Dharmas,
 and which purified beings in the yānas
in all directions, and they practiced the bodhisattva conduct that illuminated
the entire domain of the Dharma. In order to ripen and guide beings, they
appeared in villages, towns, market towns, regions, and capitals.
