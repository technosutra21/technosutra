the tathāgatas; sending down onto the abode of the lord of the kinnaras the
rain from the cloud of Dharma called the singing of the songs
 of all the clouds of
Dharma; sending down onto the abode of the lord of the nāgas the rain from
the cloud of Dharma called the miraculous resounding of the bodhisattvas that
creates dismay with saṃsāra; sending down onto the abode of the lord of the
mahoragas the rain from the cloud of Dharma called the power that increases an
ocean of joy; sending down onto the world of humans the rain from the cloud
of Dharma called the range
 of knowledge that is superior to that of all beings;
sending down onto the world of the hells the rain from the cloud of Dharma
called the voice that ends all the suffering of saṃsāra; sending down onto those
reborn as animals the rain from the cloud of Dharma called the form of the field
of the clouds of mindfulness of the tathāgatas that describes the practice of the path of
irreproachable activities; sending down onto those in the world of Yama
 the
rain from the cloud of Dharma called the proclamation of the perfections of all the
tathāgatas that gives rise to generosity in the minds of all beings; and sending down
onto the beings who had fallen down the rain from the cloud of Dharma
called the roar of the voice that brings relief through the attainment of the cessation of
all suffering. [F.360.a]

Sudhana also saw issuing forth from all of Sāgara dhvaja’s pores, from each
of his pores, fields of networks of light rays that were as numerous as the
atoms in countless buddha realms, were filling the ten directions of the realm
of phenomena, and formed countless arrays of powers
 and adopted forms
prepared to carry out countless different activities.
510
9. 33
Sudhana saw some of the fields of networks of light rays from the pores
performing the miracle of giving away all possessions through a faultless
conduct of generosity.
9. 34
Sudhana saw some of the fields of networks of light rays from the pores
manifesting the field of the correct conduct, discipline, commitment, and
precepts
 of the bodhisattvas of the three times.
511
9. 35
Sudhana saw some of the fields of networks of light rays from the pores
manifesting the forms of the conduct of patience of the bodhisattvas in the
three times. They manifested them enduring their hands, feet, and heads512

being cut off. They manifested them enduring their bodies being beaten with
fists and sticks and struck by weapons. They manifested them enduring their
bodies being cut apart
 or their hearts and eyes being plucked out.
513
9. 36
Sudhana saw the manifestation of forms of the images of the conduct of
patience of all bodhisattvas: the formed appearances of other bodhisattvas
appearing in the three times who, in seeking omniscience with great
compassion, were enduring, forbearing, and indifferent to physical and
mental torments and to their limbs and the smaller parts of their bodies being
cut off. [F.360.b]
9. 37
Sudhana saw some of the fields of networks of light rays from the pores
manifesting the different separate forms of the conduct of diligence of all
bodhisattvas: the manifestations of the diligence of the bodhisattvas of the
past, future, and present making worlds tremble, agitating
 the oceans,
causing beings to be dismayed with saṃsāra, terrifying
 all tīrthikas,
causing the hordes of māras to flee, and illuminating the aspects of the
Dharma.
514
515
9. 38
Sudhana also saw some of the fields of networks of light rays from the
pores manifesting all the many kinds of bodhisattva conduct that are
performed: all their choosing of an existence; their being born into a family;
their formation of a body; their being taught by kalyāṇamitras; the locations
for their practicing the instructions of the kalyāṇamitra; the temples,
locations, aerial palaces, lands, or mountain caves that are favorable for the
practice of the aspects of the meditation of the tathāgatas; their physical
forms as ṛṣis in which they accomplish those aspects of meditation; their
ruling as kings; their aspiration for renunciation; and the discipline,
commitment, and precepts of their path of mendicancy.
9. 39
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, also saw some of the fields of networks
of light rays from each of the pores manifesting [F.361.a] the practice of the
conduct of the perfection of wisdom. He saw the acquisitions of a body for
seeking all the Dharma, in those bodies giving up all possessions for the
sake of a single word of the Dharma, seeking that single word from all
beings, seeking it from all kalyāṇamitras with service and respect, and
seeking it from all the tathāgatas with faith, veneration, and bowing down
the body. Just as they do for a single word of the Dharma, they do the same
for all the words of the Dharma that have the perfection of wisdom of the
tathāgatas, seeking them with the apparent image of a body appearing
among all beings.
9. 40
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, also saw some of the fields of networks
of light rays from each of the pores manifesting the methods of all
bodhisattvas for ripening beings, for gathering as pupils all beings, and he
saw the entire vast extent of the ocean of beings. He saw the dedication to


---

the conduct of skillful methods in their previous lifetimes, how they
gathered pupils through having a body that was the same as that of each
and every being.
9. 41
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, also saw some of the fields of networks
of light rays from each of the pores manifesting the conduct that
accomplishes the prayers of all the bhagavats in the past kalpas, the conduct
that accomplishes the prayers for ripening all beings, and the conduct that
accomplishes the prayers for purifying all realms. [F.361.b] Within the field of
the accomplishment of those prayers they accomplished the remedy for each
fault of saṃsāra at the feet of this and that tathāgata. Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, saw all of these manifesting from each single field of
networks of light rays from a pore.
9. 42
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, also saw some of the fields of networks
of light rays from each of the pores manifesting an ocean of all the past
conduct of the perfection of strength.
9. 43
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, also saw some of the fields of networks
of light rays from each of the pores manifesting an ocean of all the past
practice of the conduct of wisdom that has the nature of awaking beings
from the sleep of ignorance.
9. 44
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, thus observed and examined the
bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja resting in meditation. He was mindful of the field of
liberation of samādhi; he was contemplating the inconceivable,
 supreme
power of bodhisattva samādhi; he was comprehending that inconceivable
ocean of ways to benefit beings; he was following and was devoted
 to that
inconceivable,
 complete display of the composite gateways for entry into
those streams of conduct; he was entering through the gateway to the pure
wisdom of the display of the realm of phenomena; he was examining the
wisdom that is received through the blessing of the buddhas; he was
developing the strength of those bodhisattva powers; he was making firm
the strength of those bodhisattva prayers; and he was increasing the
strength of that bodhisattva conduct. In that way, he sat before the bhikṣu
Sāgara dhvaja for an entire day and night. [F.362.a] He sat before the bhikṣu
Sāgara dhvaja for two days, for seven days, for half a month, for a whole
month, for two months, for six months, and for another six days and nights.

9. 45
When six months and six days had passed, the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja arose
from his samādhi. Then Sudhana said to him, “Ārya, this wonderful samādhi
that is so profound; that is so vast; that has such an immeasurable scope; that
has such an inconceivable manifestation; that has such an unequaled
radiance; that has such innumerable displays; that has such an inviolable
range; that has such an unalloyed scope; that has such a universal
illumination; that has such an accomplishment of benefit for limitless beings;


---

that brings such a cessation of the measureless sufferings of all beings; that
is present in order to end the sufferings of poverty; that is present in order to
save beings from existences of rebirth as animals, in order to close all the
gateways that lead to unfortunate existences, in order to lead onto the path
to higher existences, in order to bring the joy and happiness of devas and
humans, in order to bring the experience of joy within the scope of
meditation, in order to increase joy in composite conduct, and in order to
show the gateway to escape from the three realms that is present in order to
illuminate the causes for the creation of the aspiration to enlightenment, to
increase the causes for generating the accumulations of merit and wisdom,
[F.362.b] to increase the vast power of great compassion, to develop the
strength of great prayers, to attain the illumination of the path of the
bodhisattvas, to establish the yāna of the perfections, to accomplish entry
into the exceptional Mahāyāna, to know and illuminate the completely good
conduct, to know and attain the illumination of the bodhisattva bhūmi, to
accomplish the prayers, conduct, and pure-emergence displays of all the
bodhisattvas; and that becomes present in order to ascend without
impediment to the level of omniscience —Ārya, what is the name of this
samādhi?”
9. 46
The bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja answered, “Noble one, it is the perfection of
wisdom called the complete vision of the attainment of equanimity. The radiance of
that samādhi is called the pure display of every gateway.
9. 47
“Noble one, if you meditate on the pure display of every gateway samādhi that
arises from attaining the radiance of the perfection of wisdom called the
complete vision of the attainment of equanimity, then you will accomplish ten
times countless hundreds of thousands of samādhis such as the pure display of
every gateway.”
9. 48
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, what is the range of this samādhi?”
The bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja answered, “Noble one, if you rest in this
samādhi, you will have no impediment in perceiving world realms; you will
have no impediment in entering those world realms; you will have no
impediment in overpowering those world realms; you will have no
impediment in adorning those world realms; you will have no impediment in
cleansing those world realms; [F.363.a] you will have no impediment in
purifying those world realms; you will have no impediment in perceiving
and looking at the buddhas; you will have no impediment in examining the
greatness of the buddhas; you will have no impediment in knowing the
miracles of the buddhas; you will have no impediment in comprehending
and understanding the strengths of the buddhas; you will have no
impediment in comprehending the ocean of the qualities of the buddhas;
you will have no impediment in obtaining the rain of the Dharma clouds of


---

the buddhas; you will have no impediment in knowing and understanding
distinctly the Dharma wheels of the buddhas; you will have no impediment
in comprehending and understanding the ocean of the circles of followers of
the buddhas; you will have no impediment in comprehending and following
the ten directions; you will have no impediment in examining the Dharma
taught by the buddhas; you will have no impediment in examining the
directions of the buddhas; you will have no impediment in never
abandoning the direction of great compassion; you will have no impediment
in filling the directions with great love; you will have no impediment in
never tiring of the direction of gazing at the buddhas; you will have no
impediment in comprehending and understanding all of the ocean of the
buddhas; you will have no impediment in knowing and understanding all of
the ocean of beings; you will have no impediment in knowing and
understanding all of the ocean of the faculties of beings; and you will have
no impediment in knowing all the different faculties of beings.
9. 49
“Noble one, I know only this conduct of the perfection of wisdom. How
could I know or describe the qualities of, teach the conduct of, describe the
scope of, praise the strength of the great prayers of, illuminate the gateway
for the emergence of, describe the true accomplishment of, teach the path of,
follow the continuum of samādhi of, know the scope of the mind of, or be
able to comprehend the equanimity of the wisdom of the entry by the
bodhisattvas in the ocean of the conduct of the perfection of wisdom? So too
of the pure understanding of the scope of the realm of phenomena, [F.363.b]
of having the wisdom that follows knowing all phenomena, of pervading the
immeasurable field of perception with a vast understanding, of having the
power of the radiance of great mental retention, of the purity of the radiance
of the field of samādhi, of the emergence of the mighty power of miraculous
clairvoyance, of entering an ocean of unceasing discernment, of the sweet
voice of the essence of the bodhisattva bhūmi, or of becoming a refuge for all
beings.
9. 50
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a land called
Samudravetāḍī, in which there is a park named Samanta vyūha to the east of
the city Mahāprabhasa. There dwells an upāsikā by the name of Āśā, who is
the wife of Suprabhasa, a lord over humans. Go to her and ask her, ‘How
should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
9. 51
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was overjoyed, pleased, happy,
and content, having received the essence from the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja,
having been nourished by the Dharma, having been brought into the field of
samādhi, having attained the illumination of the light of wisdom, [F.364.a]
having attained the illumination of the radiance of samādhi, having realized


---

a pure aspiration, his mind
 having followed the radiance of the way of the
Dharma, possessing the radiance from the pure gateways, and having the
wisdom that has arisen from the light of all directions.
520
9. 52
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja, circumambulated the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja a hundred
thousand times, keeping him to his right, bowed down and paid homage to
the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja, and, looking back again and again, paying homage
to him, bowing down to him, venerating him,
 respecting him,
 keeping
him in mind, thinking of him, meditating on him, meditating deeply on him,
speaking highly of him, calling out in wonderment over him, focusing on his
qualities, praising him,
 being his follower, remembering him,
 relying on
him, never forsaking him, mentally approaching him and being connected
with him, being unified in prayer, longing to see him, remembering the
qualities of his voice, preserving the memory of him, keeping his name in his
mind, remembering his color and his form, contemplating the scope of his
wisdom, comprehending the range of his samādhi, joining him in the scope
of his prayers, practicing the range of his conduct, and receiving the
radiance of his wisdom, he departed from the presence of the bhikṣu Sāgara-
dhvaja. [B31]
