Sudhana eventually arrived in the land of Vetramūlaka, and he searched
everywhere for the town of Samanta mukha, unwearyingly, fearlessly, and
with unflagging diligence and an inviolable determination. He searched in
the principal and intermediate directions, the districts and subdistricts, high
and low, up and down. He never forgot the instructions of the
kalyāṇamitras, always keeping the perfect conduct of the kalyāṇamitras in
his heart, possessing the faculties that were all observant, devoid of all
carelessness, his eyes and his ears never distracted.
19. 3
Having searched everywhere, Sudhana finally saw, in the center of the
land of Vetramūlaka, the town of Samanta mukha. It was a town with ten
thousand marketplaces. It was excellently built. It was encircled by a strong
wall that was very high. It was beautified by having eight crossroads.
19. 4
In the middle of the town, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw the
perfume seller Samanta netra in a perfume shop. [F.20.a] He approached the
perfume seller Samanta netra, bowed his head to Samanta netra’s feet, and sat
down before him. With his hands together in homage, he said, “Ārya, I have

developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do
not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what
way they should practice it.”
Samanta netra said, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent that you have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.
19. 5
“Noble one, I know the illnesses of all beings: those that come from air,
those that come from bile, those that come from phlegm, those that come
from their balance being disturbed, those that come from harm by others,
and those that come from nonhuman beings, from drinking poison, from the
effects of various mantras, weapons, and vetālas, from the agitation of water,
and from various fears and terrors. I know them all. I also know how to cure
all those illnesses. I know oiling, emetics, purgatives, enemas, bloodletting,
inhalations, 
sweating, 
compresses, 
unguents, 
massaging, 
antidotes,
exorcisms, nourishment, bathing, resting, causing growth, purifying the
complexion, and increasing strength.
19. 6
“Noble one, I cure all the illnesses of all the beings who come to me from
the ten directions. When I have healed them, I have them bathed, their
bodies anointed with unguents, their limbs adorned with jewelry, and their
bodies dressed in clothes; I satisfy them with foods that have various kinds
of excellent flavors [F.20.b] and make them fortunate with immeasurable
wealth.
19. 7
“Afterward I teach them the Dharma so that through being taught
impurity they will eliminate desire.
“I teach them the Dharma so that through the praising of love they will
eliminate anger.
19. 8
“I teach them the Dharma so that through the teaching of the particular
categories of phenomena they will eliminate ignorance.
“I teach them the Dharma so that through the teaching of the gateways to
the ways of special realizations they will eliminate the conduct that comes
from all kleśas equally.
19. 9
“I elucidate for them the cause for the arising of the aspiration for
enlightenment by relating to them descriptions of the phenomena that are
the qualities of the buddhas.
“I teach them the cause for the arising of great compassion by teaching
them the immeasurable sufferings of saṃsāra.
19. 10
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of measureless
qualities by praising the gathering of a vast accumulation of merit and
wisdom.
“I teach them the cause for the arising of Mahāyāna prayers by teaching
them how all beings should be ripened and guided.

19. 11
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the completely
good conduct of the bodhisattva by explaining the vast net of their conduct
of dwelling in all buddha realms and all kalpas.
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of a buddha’s body
adorned with the signs and features of a great being by praising the
perfection of generosity.
19. 12
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the pure
tathāgata’s body that can be anywhere by describing the perfection of good
conduct.
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the tathāgata’s
body with its inconceivable, pure color by describing the perfection of
patience. I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the
tathāgata’s invincible body by describing the perfection of diligence. [F.21.a]
19. 13
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the tathāgata’s
pure body, which is unsurpassable and overwhelming, by describing the
perfection of meditation.
“I teach the pure Dharma body by describing the perfection of wisdom.
19. 14

the perfection of skillful method.

kalpas by describing the perfection of prayer.
19. 15
“I teach the pure bodies that arise in all buddha realms by describing the
perfection of strength.
“I teach the pure bodies that satisfy all beings in accordance with their
wishes by describing the perfection of knowledge.
19. 16
“I teach the pure body that is the highest goodness by describing the
rejection of all bad qualities.
19. 17
“In that way, those comprise the generosity of giving the Dharma. I also
support them by distributing an accumulation of endless wealth and jewels.
19. 18
“Noble one, I also know about all perfumes, incenses, aromas,
infusions,
 ointments, and their combinations.
998
19. 19
“In that way, I know all combinations of perfumes: kings of perfumes such
as sesame, kings of perfumes such as chaste tree, kings of perfumes such as
ajivāti, kings of perfumes such as vibodhana, kings of perfumes such as
aruṇavati, kings of perfumes such as yellow sandalwood, kings of perfumes
such as uragasāra sandalwood, kings of perfumes such as cloud agarwood,
and kings of perfumes such as akṣobhyendriya. [F.21.b]
19. 20
“Also, noble one, I know the kind of perfume that will satisfy all beings
and through which one sees, makes offering to, and honors the buddhas
anywhere.

19. 21
“Noble one, through this kind of perfume that will satisfy all beings and
through which one sees, makes offering to, and honors the buddhas
anywhere, all of my wishes are fulfilled. Through its power I manifest clouds
of adornments that will protect all beings. In that way, I manifest clouds of
perfume that form aerial palaces
 and so on, up to clouds of adornments
that venerate and make offerings to all the tathāgatas.
999
19. 22
“Thus, noble one, when I wish to make offerings to the tathāgatas, then
from this form of perfume that will satisfy all beings and through which one
sees, makes offering to, and honors the buddhas anywhere, I manifest
clouds of perfume that form countless kūṭāgāras, and throughout the realm
of phenomena I manifest clouds of perfume in the form of kūṭāgāras that
adorn the assemblies of the followers of the tathāgatas present throughout
the realm of phenomena in the ten directions.
19. 23
“All the pure buddha realms become adorned by clouds, an adornment of
clouds as palaces of perfume, an adornment of clouds as walls of perfume,
an adornment of clouds as ornamental roofs of perfume, an adornment of
clouds as toraṇas of perfume, an adornment of clouds as windows of
perfume, an adornment of clouds as balconies of perfume, an adornment of
clouds as a crescent moon of perfume, an adornment of clouds as parasols of
perfume, an adornment of clouds as erected banners of perfume, an
adornment of clouds as flags of perfume, an adornment of clouds as
canopies of perfume, an adornment of clouds as nets of strings of beads of
perfume, [F.22.a] an adornment of clouds as lights of perfume, an adornment
of clouds as a display of the stainless radiances of perfume, and an
adornment of rain from clouds of all perfume.
19. 24
“Noble one, I know only this Dharma gateway called the forms of perfume
that satisfy all beings and through which in every way one sees, makes offerings to, and
honors the buddhas. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
the bodhisattvas who are like kings of medicine, who are beneficial to see,
who are beneficial to be with, who are beneficial to think of, whose self-
discipline is beneficial to follow, whose names are beneficial to hear, the
mere sight of whom causes the kleśas of all beings to cease, the mere sight of
whom causes beings to turn away from the existences in the lower realms,
the mere sight of whom causes all beings to gain the opportunity to receive
the Buddhadharma, the mere sight of whom causes the mass of suffering of
beings to end, the mere sight of whom causes all beings to be free of the fear
of all the existences in saṃsāra, the mere sight of whom causes all beings to
be resolute in going in the direction of omniscience and therefore attain
fearlessness, the mere sight of whom causes beings not to fall into the


---

crevasse or chasm of old age and death, and the mere sight of whom causes
beings to rest in the equality of the realm of phenomena and therefore attain
the bliss of nirvāṇa?
19. 25
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called
Tāladhvaja. There dwells a king by the name of Anala. Go to him and ask
him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
19. 26
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
perfume-seller head merchant Samanta netra, [F.22.b] circumambulated the
perfume-seller head merchant Samanta netra many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from the perfume-seller head merchant Samanta netra.
