MEGHA
7. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was filled with the power and might of
faith in the Dharma. He was focused on the idea of following the Buddha; he
was sincerely dedicated to the lineage of the Three Jewels; his mind
illuminated the worlds of the three times;
 he was focused on following the
great aspiration; he was continuously dedicated
 to saving all the realms of
beings; his mind did not dwell on composite pleasures;
 he was devoted to
contemplating the nature of all phenomena; he never deviated from the
aspiration to purify all world realms; he dwelled without attachment in the
circles of the assemblies of all the buddhas; he remembered the light of the
Dharma;
 he remembered his kalyāṇamitras;
 and he proclaimed the
lineage of freedom from desire.

Eventually he arrived at Vajrapura in the Draviḍa region. He searched and
searched for the Dravidian Megha until he saw him in one of the courtyards
in the town. He was seated on a lion throne in order to teach the Dharma,
and he was teaching the Dharma teaching called the display of the rotating
wheel of syllables to about ten thousand beings. [F.338.a]
7. 3
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
Dravidian Megha, circumambulated the Dravidian Megha to his right many
hundreds of thousands of times, sat before him, and with palms together
said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment. However, I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct; how they should practice it; how bodhisattvas do not
lose the aspiration to enlightenment; how they keep their motivation firm
within all the states of existence so that they do not lose heart;
 how they
purify their resolve so that they do not become oppressed; how they develop
the power of great compassion so that they do not lose heart; how they gain
the power of retention so that all gateways are purified; how they develop
the light of wisdom, the light that frees all phenomena from darkness, so that

the darkness that obscures omniscience will be dispersed; how they gain the
power of discernment so that they perfect the domain of voice through being
skilled in meaning, Dharma, definitions, and eloquence; how they gain the
power of memory so that they will possess without differentiation all the
Buddha’s Dharma wheels; how they purify states of rebirth
 so that they
will realize and follow the light in all rebirths and phenomena in all
directions; and how the power of bodhisattvas’ samādhi is brought forth so
as to have the highest certainty and analysis of all the meanings of the
Dharma.”

7. 4
Then the Dravidian Megha, [F.338.b] in order to show respect to the
bodhisattva, rose from his throne, stepped down, and with his entire body
prostrated before Sudhana, the head merchant’s son. He scattered a heap of
golden flowers toward Sudhana, the head merchant’s son. He scattered
many priceless precious jewels and supreme sandalwood powder. He
draped him in many hundreds of thousands of cloths that had been dyed in
various colors. He scattered many beautiful and delightful perfumed flowers
of many different colors. He also made offerings with other kinds of
offerings, showing him respect, honor, and veneration.
7. 5
He said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent,
excellent, that you have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment and that you have an unceasing dedication to the lineage of
all the buddhas, you are dedicated to correctly imparting knowledge of the
lineage of freedom from desire, you practice the purification of the classes of
realms, you are prepared for ripening and guiding all classes of beings, you
are dedicated to correctly examining all the traditions of the Dharma, you
maintain a state of not contravening all the classes of karma, you are
dedicated to perfecting the classes of bodhisattva conduct, you correctly
engage in a continuity of all classes of prayers, you engage in
comprehending through wisdom all the classes of three times, and you are
dedicated to making firm the classes of motivations. [F.339.a]
7. 6
“That is the blessing of all the many tathāgatas, that is the intention of all
the buddhas, that is the attainment of equality of all the bodhisattvas, that is
what all the āryas rejoice in, that is what delights all the Brahmakāyika lords,
that is what is offered to by all the deva lords, that is what is protected by all
the yakṣa lords, that is what is honored by all the rākṣasa lords, that is what
is welcomed by all the nāga lords, that is what is praised by all the kinnara
lords, and that is what is praised by all the lords of the world.
7. 7
“It is what prevents the entire realm of beings from being reborn in the
three lower existences and turns them away from all paths to unfortunate
and lower existences. It turns them away from the paths that lead to poverty.
It brings the attainment of the good fortune of devas and humans.

7. 8
“Through it there will be no separation from seeing the kalyāṇamitra, no
separation from the vast ocean of the Buddhadharma; it purifies the
aspiration for enlightenment, it accomplishes the cause
 of the aspiration
for enlightenment, it obtains the illumination of the bodhisattva path, it
brings the realization of bodhisattva wisdom, and it brings the relief of being
on the level of a bodhisattva.
407
7. 9
“Noble one, this is what I think: the bodhisattvas accomplish what is
difficult, they are the manifestation of a sight that is difficult to obtain, and
they are a comfort to the world; [F.339.b] the bodhisattvas are like fathers and
mothers to all beings; the bodhisattvas are like adornments for this world
and its paradises; the bodhisattvas save beings from the torments of
suffering; the bodhisattvas remain in order to protect all beings; the
bodhisattvas are a refuge
 from the misfortune of various kinds of danger;
the bodhisattvas are like the disk of air
 because it prevents beings from
falling into the lower existences; the bodhisattvas are like the earth because
they increase the roots of merit of all beings; the bodhisattvas are like the
ocean because they contain an inexhaustible treasure of precious merit; the
bodhisattvas are like the sun because they shine with the light of wisdom;
the bodhisattvas are like Sumeru because of the great height of their roots of
merit; the bodhisattvas are like the moon because they rise as the moon of
the wisdom of the essence of enlightenment; the bodhisattvas are like
warriors because they defeat the armies of the māras; the bodhisattvas are
like heroes because they reach the self-arisen city of the Dharma; the
bodhisattvas are like Agni because they dry up the wetness of the self-
love
 of all beings; the bodhisattvas are like clouds because they send
down rain from the vast cloud of the Dharma; the bodhisattvas are like rain
because they increase the sprouts of the faculties, faith, and so on of beings;
the bodhisattvas are like mariners because they reveal the point of
embarkation for crossing the ocean of the Dharma; [F.340.a] the bodhisattvas
are like a bridge because they enable all beings to cross over the ocean of
saṃsāra; and the bodhisattvas are like fords because they enable beings to
cross over.”

7. 10
In that way, Megha the Dravidian, while sitting before Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, praised the bodhisattvas with those words and
congratulated Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
7. 11
As he was proclaiming those words that brought delight to bodhisattvas, a
mass of light rays was emitted from his mouth in this fashion: that mass of
light rays spread throughout the billion worlds. Those beings who saw it
and were illuminated by that great radiance —devas and devas with great
miraculous power, nāgas and nāgas with great miraculous power, yakṣas
and yakṣas with great miraculous power, gandharvas and gandharvas with

great miraculous power, asuras and asuras with great miraculous power,
garuḍas and garuḍas with great miraculous power, kinnaras and kinnaras
with great miraculous power, mahoragas and mahoragas with great
miraculous power, humans and humans with great miraculous power,
nonhumans and nonhumans with great miraculous power, Brahmakāyikas
and Brahmakāyikas with great miraculous power —came into the presence of
Megha the Dravidian.
7. 12
Their thoughts were thus blessed by Megha the Dravidian, and they
placed their palms together in homage. Their bodies and minds were
refreshed, they felt vast joy, they showed great veneration, they had cast
down the banner of pride,
 they were free of deceit, and their senses were
serene. Megha the Dravidian taught them extensively the Dharma teaching
called The Display of the Rotating Wheel of Syllables. [F.340.b] He made it known
to them, introduced them to it, led them into it, and caused them to
understand it.
 Having heard it, they all gained irreversible progress
toward the highest, complete enlightenment.
411
412
7. 13
Then Megha the Dravidian sat again upon the Dharma throne and said to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, I have attained Sarasvatī’s
power of retention. Through its power I know the divine languages of the
devas in these world realms of the billion-world universe. In the same way, I
know the languages of the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans and the Brahmakāyika
language of the Brahmakāyika devas.
7. 14
“I know the various divine languages of the devas, and similarly I know
the various languages of the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, 
mahoragas, 
humans, 
and 
nonhumans 
and 
the 
various
Brahmakāyika languages of the Brahmakāyika devas.
7. 15
“I know the different divine languages of the devas, and similarly I know
the different languages of the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans and the different
Brahmakāyika languages of the Brahmakāyika devas.
7. 16
“I also know the different signs, languages, and names of the beings who
have been reborn as animals. I also know the different languages and names
of the beings who have been reborn in the hells. I also know the different
languages and names of the beings in the realm of Yama.
 [F.341.a] I also
know the languages and names of the āryas. I also know the languages and
names of those who are not āryas. I also know the words, signs, and
definitions of bodhisattvas that arise in accordance with the wishes of
beings.

7. 17
“In each instant of mind, I perceive and comprehend the aspects of the
voices and the oceans of speech of all the tathāgatas in the three times, and
the words, the sound of conversations, and the languages that are used by
all beings.
7. 18
“Just as I perceive and know the ocean of terms, definitions, languages,
and names of beings in this world realm of a billion worlds, in the same way,
I perceive and know the ocean of terms, definitions, languages, and names
of beings in a quintillion world realms, a measureless number of world
realms, innumerable world realms, an inconceivable number of world realms,
an unequaled number of world realms, an infinite number of world realms,
limitless world realms, and an inexpressible number of world realms in the
eastern direction, and it is the same for the south, the west, the north, the
northeast, the southeast, the southwest, the northwest, below, and above.
7. 19
“In that way, I know the deva language of the devas, and so on, up to
knowing the Brahmakāyika language of the Brahmakāyika devas.
7. 20
“Noble one, I know the light of Sarasvatī’s power of retention that the
bodhisattvas have, but how could I know the conduct or describe the
qualities of the entry by the bodhisattvas into an ocean of different terms,
[F.341.b] their entry into an ocean of terms and languages of various beings,
their entry into an ocean of taught names of various beings, their entry into
an ocean of an array of descriptions by various beings, their entry into an
ocean of conducts, their entry into an ocean of the conjunctions of all words,
their entry into an ocean of the literal meaning of words, their entry into an
ocean of single terms for perceptions that include all perceptions in the three
times, their entry into an ocean of teaching through assembling a single
word,
 their entry into an ocean of teaching through assembling two
words,
 their entry into an ocean of teaching through dividing words, their
entry into an ocean of teaching that brings guidance through categorizing
the words
 for all phenomena, their entry into an ocean of the languages of
all beings, their entry in the entire pure display of the field of speech, and
what arises in the categories of the apex of the wheel of words?
414

7. 21
“Now depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land of Vanavāsī,
there dwells a head merchant by the name of Muktaka. Go to him and ask
him, ‘How should bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct? How should
they set forth? How should their minds rest in meditation?’ ”
7. 22
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
Megha the Dravidian, and showing respect for his Dharma, showing that
Megha was the source for the signs of the arising of his faith, and seeing the
omniscience that has come from the kalyāṇamitra, [F.342.a] weeping, with


---

his face covered in tears, he circumambulated Megha the Dravidian a
hundred thousand times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back a
hundred thousand times, departed from Megha the Dravidian. [B29]
