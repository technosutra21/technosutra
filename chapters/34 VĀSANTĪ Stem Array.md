Chapter 34
VĀSANTĪ
34. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembering the teaching of the earth
goddess Sthāvarā, remembering the bodhisattva liberation called the essence of
invincible wisdom, becoming adept in the meditation of bodhisattva samādhi,
contemplating the way of the bodhisattva Dharma, analyzing the displays of
bodhisattva liberation, viewing the very subtle wisdom of bodhisattva
liberation, entering the ocean of the wisdom of bodhisattva liberation, with
faith in the different wisdoms of bodhisattva liberation, realizing the mastery
of the wisdom of bodhisattva liberation, and descending into the ocean of
the wisdom of bodhisattva liberation, arrived at the location of the town of
Kapilavastu.
34. 2
He circumambulated the town of Kapilavastu, keeping it to his right, and
entered the town through its eastern gate.
34. 3
He stayed at the town’s central junction of three streets, where, soon after
sunset, wishing to see Vāsantī, the goddess of the night, while reverentially
following the bodhisattva teaching, having the definite understanding that
the wisdom of buddhahood is attained through kalyāṇamitras, having the
blessing of the scope of the view of the eyes of wisdom, facing every
direction [F.80.a] with the aspiration to see the kalyāṇamitra, with a mind
that perceives the essence of great wisdom, with eyes of wisdom that
engage with all objects of perception, with eyes of samādhi that pervade the
vast extent of the ocean of the wisdom of all the ways of the realm of
phenomena, seeing the ocean of all that is to be known in all directions, with
a single-pointed mind intent on attaining the eyes of wisdom resting with
one-pointed thought, he saw Vāsantī, the goddess of the night, in the realm
of space above the great town of Kapilavastu. She was in a kūṭāgāra of
various precious jewels beyond compare. She was seated upon a lotus that
had every excellent aroma, in the center of a great precious lion throne. Her
body was the color of gold. Her hair was soft, abundant, and deep black. Her


---

eyes were deep black.
 She was beautiful, attractive, and lovely to the
sight. Her body was beautified by all jewelry and adornments. She was
wearing dyed
 clothing. She possessed a sacred topknot adorned by the
disk of the moon as a crest. The constellations, the planets, and all the stars
appeared in her body.
1285
1286
34. 4
He saw within her pores all the beings she had liberated who in the vast
realm of beings had fallen into inopportune states, lower existences, and
lower realms.
34. 5
He saw within her pores all those she had brought to the higher realms,
all those she had ripened for the enlightenment of the śrāvakas and
pratyeka buddhas, and those she had ripened for omniscience.
34. 6
He saw within her pores all her created bodies, [F.80.b] created forms, and
created colors that were her various methods that ripened beings.
34. 7
He heard sounding from her pores the creation of sounds, the creation of
the aspects of the voice, and their application to the various ways of
speech
 through which she ripened beings.
1287
34. 8
He perceived within her pores her creation of times, her bodhisattva
conduct, her bodhisattva prowess, her entrances to bodhisattva samādhis
and transformations, her bodhisattva power of leadership, her bodhisattva
states of being,
 her bodhisattva view, her bodhisattva observation, her
bodhisattva emanations, her bodhisattva lion-like awesomeness of a great
being, and her displays of bodhisattva liberation through which she ripened
beings in accordance with their motivations and aspirations.
1288
34. 9
He saw and heard an ocean of the ways of the Dharma that employed
various methods, and he was satisfied, joyful, pleased, delighted, content,
and happy. He prostrated to the night goddess Vāsantī with the full length
of his body, got up, and circumambulated the night goddess Vāsantī,
keeping her to his right, many hundreds of thousands of times. Then he
stood before her and, with his hands placed together in homage, said,
“Goddess, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment. I have seen that all the qualities of buddhahood arise
through the blessing of a kalyāṇamitra. [F.81.a] I put myself in the hands of
the kalyāṇamitra. Show me, goddess, the path to omniscience upon which a
bodhisattva will bring forth the ten strengths.”
34. 10
The night goddess Vāsantī said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
“Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you are thus in awe of
kalyāṇamitras and wish to hear a kalyāṇamitra’s words and practice the
teaching of kalyāṇamitras.
34. 11
“Noble one, through thus practicing the teaching of the kalyāṇamitras,
you will, without a doubt, approach the highest, complete enlightenment.

34. 12
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to
guiding beings through the radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all
beings. My mind has love for beings who have unstable minds. My mind has
compassion for beings who follow the path of nonvirtuous actions. My mind
rejoices in those who follow the path of virtuous actions. My mind does not
discriminate between beings with stable and unstable minds. My motivation
is to purify those afflicted by the kleśas. My motivation is to bring the pitiful
to perfection. My motivation is to generate a vast aspiration in those with
inferior aspiration. My motivation is to develop great diligence in those with
inferior power.
 [F.81.b] My motivation is to turn away from existences in
the cycle of saṃsāra those whose aspiration is for saṃsāra. My motivation is
to establish on the path to omniscience those beings whose aspiration is for
the Śrāvakayāna and Pratyeka buddhayāna.
1289
34. 13
“Noble one, those are the motivations and intentions that I have. I possess
the bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to guiding beings through the
radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all beings.
34. 14
“When beings are in darkness, humans sleep, the hosts of spirits roam
around, the numbers of thieves and robbers increase, dangerous beings are
active in all directions, thick black clouds cover everything, there is a thick
mass of smoke or dust, there is the assault of terrible wind and rain, the
moon and stars are hidden, and the eyes are unable to see.
34. 15
“Noble one, through various methods I protect those beings in the
darkness who are on the ocean, on a plain, on mountains, in a remote
wilderness,
 in
 a forest, in the countryside, in a town, in a direction, in
an intermediate direction, or on a road; those on the ocean whose ship is
sinking; those who are in distress; those on the plains; those who are falling
down precipices in the mountains; those who have no food or drink in
remote wildernesses; those caught in thickets of bamboo in dense forests;
those whom calamitous wrongdoing has befallen; [F.82.a] those who are
being slain by bandits in the countryside; those who perish from ruthless
actions in towns; those who are bewildered in the directions; those who are
confused in the intermediate directions; and those who encounter disaster
on the road.
1290
1291
34. 16
“I do so in this way: for those on the great ocean, I dispel the black winds
and clouds, I make troubled waters clear, I dispel the circle of cruel winds, I
calm the huge powerful waves, I bring freedom from the danger of lightning,
I show the direction to go, I provide the correct course over the waters, I
reveal the shore, and I show the way to reach the island of jewels. I protect
them in the form of a gatherer of beings,
 the form of a merchant leader,
the form of a great-maned king of horses, the form of a king of elephants, the
1292


---

form of a king of turtles, the form of a king of the asuras, the form of a king of
the garuḍas, the form of a king of the kinnaras, the form of a king of the
mahoragas, the form of a deity of the sea, and the form of a ferryman.1293
34. 17
“I dedicate those roots of merit in this way: ‘May I be a protector of all
beings in order to free them from the entire mass of suffering!’
34. 18
“When beings on the plains at night
 are in great darkness and the
ground is covered with bamboo, thorns, pebbles, and potsherds; when there
are numerous fierce poisonous snakes, uneven ground, and difficult paths,
[F.82.b] and when dust and dirt swirl thickly; when there is the assault of
fierce wind and rain, being stricken with the suffering of heat and cold, and
the fear of snakes and wild beasts; and when bands of murderers and
bandits are prowling around, I protect those beings who are confused in the
dark, in the form of the sun, in the form of the moon, in the form of the rising
of dawn, in the form of great shooting stars, in the form of flashes of
lightning, in the form of the light of jewels, in the form of the circle of the
planets, in the form of light from the aerial palaces of the constellations and
stars, in the form of a deva, and in the form of a bodhisattva.
1294
34. 19
“In my mind there arose this aspiration: ‘May I become a refuge for all
beings through this root of merit, in order to dispel all the darkness of the
kleśas.’
34. 20
“I protect through various methods those on mountain precipices who are
afraid of dying and who through clinging to life are under the power of the
desire for fame, who desire the banner of words of renown, who have
enjoyment as their goal, who are overpowered by desire, who are engaged
in the pursuit of the prerequisites for life, who primarily yearn for worldly
good fortune, who are tied by affection to children and wife,
 who are lost
in the thicket of views, and who are oppressed by various kinds of suffering
and fears.
1295
34. 21
“I do so in this way: by providing them with caves and shelters, by
providing them with fruit and roots to eat, by providing them with streams
and springs, by providing them with protection against heat and cold,
[F.83.a] by showing them correct pathways, by the sound of the song of the
avadavat, by the sound of the cry of the king of peacocks, through the form
of illumination from burning herbs, and through the form of light from the
mountain deities.
34. 22
“I become a protector of those in mountain caves, clefts, and chasms who
are afflicted by various sufferings, by providing them with level ground, and
to dispel the blinding darkness those beings are in.
34. 23
“In my mind there arises this thought: ‘Just as I have protected these
beings who are in the mountains, may I become a protector for those who
have fallen into the chasms of the mountain of saṃsāra and have been


---

seized by the demons of old age and death.’
34. 24
“I become someone who shows the correct path to follow for those beings
who are trapped in the net of a dense forest and blinded by the darkness of
the night; who are in distress within a tangle of trees and shrubs;
 whose
path is blocked by grass, rivers, thorns,
 trees,
 and vines; who have
entered a dense forest of numerous trees and vines; who have fear in their
hearts on hearing the roaring of tigers; who are distressed at being unable to
accomplish their goals; who are afflicted by various dangers, misfortunes,
and troubles; and who do not know the way out of a thick forest.
1296
1297
1298
34. 25
“In my mind there arises this thought: ‘Through this root of merit, may I
free from all suffering those beings who are in the thicket of various views,
who are caught in the net of craving, and who are oppressed by the various
sufferings and dangers of saṃsāra.’
34. 26
“Through various methods I bring happiness to those beings who are
confused in darkness in remote wildernesses. [F.83.b] I show them the path
and bring them to a safe and pleasant place.
34. 27
“In my mind there arises this thought: ‘Through this root of merit, may I
free from all suffering and bring to the great good fortune of the path to
happiness and omniscience those beings who are lost in the remote
wilderness of saṃsāra and are following the path to all the lower realms.’
34. 28
“Noble one, through various methods that bring disillusionment, I free
from attachment to their homeland those beings in homelands who
experience suffering caused by that attachment.
34. 29
“In my mind there arises this aspiration: ‘Through this root of merit, may I
free all beings from attachment to the skandhas and bring them to the
wisdom of omniscience that has no location.’
34. 30
“Noble one, the beings who dwell in villages, who are destroyed by their
bondage to house and home, who are bewildered in the darkness of the
night, and who suffer because of the various demands of their homes —
through various ways of causing distress, I bring them to disillusionment. I
cause them to develop a mind free of attachment. I care for them through the
gift of the Dharma. I make them perfectly content and establish them in the
Dharma that has no home.
34. 31
“In my mind there arises this thought: ‘Through this root of merit, may I
free all beings dwelling in the town of their six āyatanas from the realm of
activity that is existence in saṃsāra, and may I establish them in the realm of
activity of the wisdom of omniscience.’
34. 32
“Noble one, through various methods I bring illumination to those beings
who are bewildered in the darkness of night in the east and other directions
and intermediate directions, [F.84.a] who see level areas as being uneven
with chasms, who perceive high ground as depressions and depressions as


---

high ground,
 and who are bewildered as to the directions of paths and
areas. I reveal a door to those who wish to exit. I reveal a path to those who
wish to go upon it.
 I reveal a ford to those who wish to cross a river. I
reveal a ship to those who wish to cross
 the sea.
 I reveal a house to
those who wish to go inside. I reveal a region to those who wish to see it. I
reveal the high ground and the low ground. I reveal the areas that are level,
those that are not level, and their various forms. I reveal villages, towns,
markets,
 kingdoms, and capitals to exhausted travelers. I reveal springs,
ponds, lakes, reservoirs, lotus ponds, rivers, forests, orchards, and gardens
to those afflicted by heat and thirst. I reveal pleasant forms of various kinds
such as father, mother, children, wives, friends, families,
 and relatives to
those who wish to meet the beloved they are separated from.
1299
1300
1301
1302
1303
1304
34. 33
“In my mind there arises this thought: ‘May I bring light and illumination,
so that they will perceive the various forms around them, to those who are
bewildered in the darkness of night, whose eyes are afflicted by blindness,
and who are bewildered as to directions.
34. 34
“ ‘Similarly, there are beings who have dwelled in the darkness of saṃsāra
for a long time who are confused concerning the right direction; who are
bewildered in the darkness of ignorance; whose eyes of wisdom are clouded
by the cataracts of ignorance; [F.84.b] who have incorrect perception, mind,
and view; who perceive the impermanent as permanent; who perceive
suffering as happiness; who perceive the absence of a self as a self; who
perceive the unpleasant as pleasant; who believe in an enduring self, being,
soul, person,
 or individual; who rely on the skandhas, dhātus, and
āyatanas; who are confused about cause and result; who follow the path of
nonvirtuous actions; who kill; who steal; who engage in sexual misconduct;
who lie; who slander; who speak harsh words; who speak meaninglessly;
who are covetous; who are malicious; who hold wrong views; who do not
respect their fathers; who do not respect their mothers; who do not respect
śramaṇas and brahmins; who do not respect the powerful; who do not
respect holy beings; who have passion and devotion for what is not the
Dharma; who are overcome by inappropriate desires; who are in the
bondage of wrong views; who malign the tathāgatas; who engage in
bringing the wheel of the Dharma to an end; who hold the banner of Māra;
who harm
 bodhisattvas; who have anger toward the Mahāyāna; who are
engaged
 in reviling the aspiration to enlightenment; who criticize
bodhisattvas; who harm or injure their mothers;
 who are
 harmful and
hostile; who malign the āryas; who practice a religious conduct that is not
that of
 good people; who damage that which belongs to stūpas and the
saṅgha; who oppose their parents; who commit the acts with immediate
result on death; and who are facing a great abyss.

“ ‘May I dispel the darkness of their ignorance with the great light of
wisdom, inspire them toward the highest, complete enlightenment, and
reveal to them, through the completely good Mahāyāna, the path to the level
of the wisdom of the ten strengths, [F.85.a] the level of the tathāgatas, the
scope of the omniscient wisdom of the tathāgatas, the ocean of the ways of
omniscient wisdom, the range of activity of the wisdom of the buddhas, the
scope of the buddhas, the accomplishment of the ten strengths, and the
strength of the power of retention of the buddhas and the single
 body of
all the buddhas. Having revealed that, may I establish them in the
knowledge
 of the equality of all the buddhas.’
1311
1312
34. 36
“Noble one, I am present to save those beings who are sick, who are
depressed by being ill for a long time, whose bodies are weakened, who are
old, who have been overpowered by old age, who have no protector, who
are destitute, who are poor, who are ruined, who have gone astray into
another land, who are going in the wrong direction, who are in prison, who
are being punished, who are criminals, who are being led to execution, and
who are afraid of losing their lives.
34. 37
“Noble one, I am dedicated to using every method to heal all the illnesses
of sick beings. I serve and attend those who are old, who are overpowered
by old age. I collect the necessities for life for those who are without them. I
am a protector for beings who have no protector. I gather a mass of wealth
and gold for those who are destitute and poor. I gather what is needed for
those who are ruined. I lead those who have gone astray in other lands back
to their homelands. I take into the correct direction those who follow the
wrong direction. [F.85.b] I free from prison those who are in prison. I free
from the suffering of punishment those who are being punished. I save the
lives of those who are criminals being led to execution.
34. 38
“In my mind there arises this thought: ‘May I protect and save these
beings from these various kinds of fear and harm. Similarly, may I free them
from all the kleśas through gathering a collection of the highest Dharmas.
May I cause them to transcend birth, aging, illness, death, misery, wailing,
suffering, unhappiness, and torment. May I liberate them from all fear of
falling into the lower realms. May I bring them into the care of kalyāṇamitras.
May I gather a collection of the gift of the precious Dharma. May I establish
them in nontransgressive conduct. May I inspire them toward the pure body
of the tathāgatas. May I establish them in the realization of the essence that
is completely free of aging and death.’
34. 39
“Noble one, through various methods I become the protector of those
beings who follow wrong paths; who are attached to various dark views;
who have the range of activity of incorrect concepts;
 who engage in
dreadful physical, vocal, and mental conduct; who follow various kinds of
1313


---

discipline and asceticism; who view that which is not complete buddhahood
as complete buddhahood; who are engaged in paining and tormenting their
bodies; who bow down to, pay homage to, and place their trust in lakes,
ponds, springs, reservoirs, rivers, precipitous mountains, the directions, and
the intermediate directions; and who are under the power of bad
companions. [F.86.a]
34. 40
“I turn them away from evil views and all paths that lead to falling into the
abyss of the lower realms. I establish them in the correct worldly view. I
establish them in the good fortune of humans and devas.
34. 41
“In my mind there arises this thought: ‘May I liberate these beings from
dreadful practices and suffering. Similarly, may I establish all beings in the
noble, transcendent path of the perfections. May I cause them to progress
irreversibly toward omniscience and through completely good great prayer
bring them to omniscience. And may I never depart from the level of a
bodhisattva until all realms of beings have been guided.’ ”1314
34. 42
At that time, Vāsantī, the goddess of the night, in order to teach further the
bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to guiding beings through the radiance of
the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all beings, through the blessing of the
buddhas looked into the ten directions and then recited these verses to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
34. 43
“I teach the Dharma so as to benefit beings,1315
In order to dispel the darkness of ignorance and stupidity.
I observe the time and bring happiness to beings.
This is my supreme way of liberation, of peace. {1}
34. 44
“I have perfectly practiced vast love,1316
Meditating throughout limitless kalpas in the past.
In that way, I have filled the world with illumination.
Sudhana, know this way well.
 {2}
1317
34. 45
“My ocean of compassion is measureless.
Through it the jinas of the three times appear in the world. [F.86.b]
Through it the suffering of beings is quelled.
Sudhana, know this way well. {3}
34. 46
“Creating worldly happiness
And noncomposite, higher bliss
Pleases, delights, and gladdens me.
Jinaputra, understand this way of mine. {4}
34. 47
“Always turned away from composite faults
And the wisdom, liberation, and results of the śrāvakas,


---

I purify the strengths of the buddhas.
Jinaputra, understand this way of mine. {5}
34. 48
“My eyesight is vast and completely pure.
With it I see many realms in the ten directions.
I see the self-originated ones in those realms
Seated under the lords of Bodhi trees. {6}
34. 49
“I see the buddhas and their assemblies,
The buddhas’ bodies beautified by signs,
Emanating multicolored beautiful light rays,
A multitude of light rays emanating from all their pores. {7}
34. 50
“I see the beings within those realms
And their entrances into death and rebirth,
Those foolish ones who in those oceans of existences
Continue in saṃsāra and experience the results of their actions. {8}
34. 51
“Completely pure is the ocean of my hearing
In which are gathered all sounds without exception.
I hear and hold in my memory
The entire ocean of the languages in all worlds. {9}
34. 52
“The speech beyond analogy or equal,
Adorned by all aspects of speech and all sounds,
The wheel that is turned by the jinas
I hear and hold in my memory. {10}
34. 53
“My power of smell also is completely pure.
Jinaputra, understand this way that is
The entrance to dwelling in all liberations,
Without impediment, in the ocean of the ways of the Dharma. {11}
34. 54
“My tongue is vast and extensive,
Subtle, red, and shining like a jewel.
Jinaputra, understand this way through which
I know the thoughts of beings. {12}
34. 55
“My Dharma body is completely pure. [F.87.a]
I remain in its brilliance
 throughout the three times,
1318
In a form of body in accordance with the wishes of beings,
Which they all see through the power of their faith. {13}
34. 56
“My mind is without attachment, undefiled.
The sound of speech is like the roaring of the clouds.


---

Though all lords of humans are contained in it,
I have no conceptualization concerning that. {14}
34. 57
“I know the ocean of the minds
Of the countless beings in the realms.
I know their faculties and aspirations,
But in this I have no conceptualization. {15}
34. 58
“My miracles are vast and perfectly performed.
They are inconceivable and shake the realms.
Similarly, the light and power of my body
Subdue the beings who are difficult to subdue. {16}
34. 59
“My merit is vast and completely pure,
An inexhaustible treasure completely displayed,
Through which offerings are made to the jinas
And all beings are sustained. {17}
34. 60
“Vast and completely pure is my wisdom,
Through which I know an ocean of Dharma
And cut through the doubts of all beings.
Jinaputra, understand this way of mine. {18}
34. 61
“Comprehending all three times,
I see and know an ocean of buddhas
And comprehend their prayers.
This way is measureless
 and perfect. {19}
1319
34. 62
“I see an ocean of realms within all atoms
And their entry into the three times.
I see within them an ocean of buddhas
And the level
 of their way that is present everywhere. {20}
1320
34. 63
“See how the enlightenment, the buddhahood, of Vairocana
Pervades the realms in all directions.
Within every atom, at the foot of a Bodhi tree,
He is speaking of the Dharma of peace.” {21}
34. 64
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, asked Vāsantī, the goddess of the
night, “Goddess, how long has it been since you have been established in
the highest, complete enlightenment? [F.87.b] How long has it been since
you attained this liberation through which you have become established in
accomplishing the benefit of beings in this way?”


---

34. 65
Vāsantī, the goddess of the night, answered, “Noble one, beyond and
even more beyond as many past kalpas as there are atoms in Sumeru, during
a kalpa called Praśantaprabha, there was a world realm called Ratna śrī-
saṃbhava in which there appeared five thousand million buddhas. Within
that world realm there was a medium-sized four-continent world called
Ratna candra pradīpa prabhā, the capital of which was called Padmaprabhā.
In that capital city there was King Sudharmatīrtha, who was a cakravartin
Dharma king who ruled over the four continents and possessed the seven
jewels. He spread the Dharma over the mountains and seas of that great
world up to its edges and made it happy. King Sudharmatīrtha had a queen
named Dharma mati candrā. At dusk, intoxicated by desire and exhausted by
bliss, she returned to the harem at midnight and went to sleep. To the east of
the capital city of Padmaprabhā there was a great forest called Śamatha śrī-
sambhava, in which appeared a tathāgata by the name of Sarva dharma-
nigarjita rāja, whose body shone with the light of all kings of jewels and was
the miraculous manifestation of all the buddhas. At the foot of a Bodhi tree,
he attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood. Through
the power of that, a great light of many colors filled the world realm of
Ratna śrī saṃbhava. In the capital city of Padmaprabhā there was a goddess
of the night called Suviśuddha candrābhā. [F.88.a] She approached Dharma-
mati candrā, the king’s queen, woke her with the sound of rattling her
jewelry, and said to her, ‘Know this, queen of the king! The Tathāgata Sarva-
dharma nigarjita rāja has attained the highest, complete enlightenment of
buddhahood in the great forest Śamatha śrī sambhava.’ Then, in front of the
king’s queen she praised the qualities of the buddha and described at length
the miraculous manifestations of the buddhas and the completely good
conduct and prayer of the bodhisattvas.
34. 66
“Noble one, the king’s queen was illuminated by the light from that
tathāgata, and she sincerely entered into the path to the highest, complete
enlightenment. She made offerings to that tathāgata and his saṅgha of
bodhisattvas and śrāvakas.
34. 67
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was that
king’s queen, Dharma mati candrā? Do not think that it was anyone else, for at
that time, in that time, I was the king’s queen, Dharma mati candrā.
34. 68
“Noble one, under that tathāgata I developed the motivation of aspiration
and created roots of merit so that for kalpas as numerous as the atoms in
Sumeru I never fell into rebirth in the lower realms. I was never reborn as a
denizen of hell, as an animal, or as a preta. I was never reborn in an inferior
family. I was never reborn as someone without sensory faculties. I was never
someone who suffered. I always attained the state of a great deity among


---

deities, [F.88.b] and a great human among humans. In this way, I was never
apart from buddhas and bodhisattva kalyāṇamitras. I was never reborn in a
bad time.
34. 69
“Noble one, in that way, I created roots of merit under one buddha after
another, and for as many kalpas as there are atoms in Sumeru, I traveled on
easy and level paths without any impediment, but I had not yet
accomplished the powers of a bodhisattva. When those kalpas as numerous
as the atoms in Sumeru had passed, ten thousand great kalpas before this
Bhadra kalpa, at the time of the first of those kalpas, which was called
Aśokaviraja, there was a world realm called Rajovimala tejaḥśrī.
34. 70
“Noble one, that world realm Rajovimala tejaḥśrī was completely pure of
the kleśas, and five hundred buddhas appeared within it. The first of those
five hundred buddhas was a tathāgata, an arhat, a samyak saṃbuddha, one
with wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who knows the world’s beings,
an unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a teacher of devas and humans, a
buddha, a bhagavat, who was named Sumeru dhvajāyatana śānta netra śrī. At
that time, I was Prajñāvabhāsa śrī, the daughter of the head merchant
Vighuṣṭakīrti. I was beautiful and attractive, a delight to see, with a very
beautiful, perfect complexion.

34. 71
“The goddess of the night called Suviśuddha candrābhā, through the
power of her prayers, had become the goddess of the night called Viśuddha-
netrābhā in Vicitra dhvaja, the capital of the four-continent world realm
named Virajovatī. At night, while I was not yet asleep and my parents were
asleep, [F.89.a] she shook our house, illuminated it with a great light,
revealed her own form to me, and praised the qualities of the buddhas. She
revealed the tathāgata residing at the bodhimaṇḍa seven days after he had
attained buddhahood.
34. 72
“Then, accompanied by my parents and a great crowd of my family, and
preceded by Viśuddha netrābhā, the goddess of the night, I went into the
presence of that tathāgata. I then made vast offerings to the Tathāgata, and
as soon as I saw the Tathāgata’s face, I attained the samādhi called guiding
beings and seeing the Buddha’s face and the samādhi called the domain illuminated
by the wisdom of the range of the three times. Through attaining them I
remembered as many kalpas as there are atoms in Sumeru. My aspiration to
enlightenment manifested. In that way, I heard the Dharma from that
tathāgata, and I attained the bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to
guiding beings through the radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all
beings. Through attaining that, I pervaded with my body as many worlds as
there are atoms in ten buddha realms, and there appeared to my sight all the
buddhas who were present in those worlds, and I knew that I was present at
the feet of all of them. All of the beings who had been born in those world

realms appeared to my sight, and I knew all the symbols of their different
languages. I knew their minds, thoughts, faculties, and aspirations. [F.89.b] I
knew the past kalyāṇamitras in whose presence they were ripened. I
manifested to them the bodies that satisfied them according to their
aspirations. That liberation of mine increased with each instant of the mind.
Through the instant of mind that followed that instant of mind of liberation,
my body pervaded as many buddha realms as there are atoms in a hundred
world realms. Through the next instant of mind, my body pervaded as many
buddha realms as there are atoms in a thousand world realms. Through the
next instant of mind, my body pervaded as many buddha realms as there are
atoms in a hundred thousand world realms, and so on, up to my body
pervading, in each instant of mind, as many buddha realms as there are
atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of world realms. There appeared to my
sight all the buddhas that were present in those worlds, and I knew that I
was present at the feet of all of them. I obtained all the Dharma that was
taught by those buddha bhagavats. I possessed it, kept it, preserved it. I
comprehended the past ocean of ways and ocean of prayers of those
tathāgatas. All those buddha realms purified by those tathāgatas were
created in order to purify their own buddha realms. All of the beings who
had been born in those world realms appeared to my sight. I blessed my
body in order to ripen and guide all of their different minds, thoughts,
faculties, and aspirations. [F.90.a]
34. 73
“Thus, the way in which my liberation pervaded the entire extent of the
realm of phenomena increased with each instant of mind.
34. 74
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to
guiding beings through the radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all
beings. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
bodhisattvas who have arisen from the completely good bodhisattva
conduct and prayers that have no middle or edge; who have the power to
enter the entire extent of the ways of the ocean of the realm of phenomena;
who play in the samādhi called the glorious vajra of wisdom, which is attained
by bodhisattvas
 who have arisen from the great prayers to be in the care
of all the families of tathāgatas in all world realms; who have accomplished a
great ocean of merit that purified in an instant of mind the vast extent of
world realms; who in each instant of mind ripen all the realms of beings; who
have the eyes of the sun of wisdom that dispels all the darkness of the
obscurations of all beings in all the world realms that are under the power of
their guiding wisdom; who have the power to communicate the Mahāyāna
to all the realms of beings; who possess the moon of intelligence that dispels
the darkness of doubt, uncertainty, and equivocation within all beings; who
have the pure domain of speech that lifts beings from attachment to the

entire ocean of existence; who have the power to manifest emanations in the
atoms throughout the entire realm of phenomena; [F.90.b] and who are
inseparable from the domain of the knowledge of the entire range of the
three times?
34. 75
“Depart, noble one. At the bodhimaṇḍa in this land of Magadha there is
the goddess of the night called Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā, whom I
have inspired again and again to develop the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva
train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
34. 76
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, praised the night goddess
Vāsantī with these verses:
34. 77
“I see the purity of your body
Adorned by signs, like Meru,
Superior to all worlds; within the world
You have a perfect body as beautiful as Mañjuśrī’s. {22}
34. 78
“Your Dharma body is completely pure,
The same in all three times, without conceptualization.
Every world without exception is contained within it
Without creation, destruction, or abiding. {23}
34. 79
“I see the image of your body dispersed
Throughout the whole extent of existences,
And I see within the pores of your body
The constellations of stars with the moon and planets. {24}
34. 80
“Your mind also is completely pure,
Pervading the realm of space in all directions.
Even the supreme among humans are all included within it.
You possess the supreme wisdom free of concepts. {25}
34. 81
“Multicolored clouds as numerous as the atoms in a realm
Arise out of all the pores of your body, [F.91.a]
Spread to the buddhas in the ten directions,
And send down a rainfall of all adornments. {26}
34. 82
“The endless number of the bodies as numerous as beings
Arise out of the pores of your body.
They pervade and fill the worlds in the ten directions
And purify
 beings through various methods. {27}
1323
34. 83
“I see an inconceivable number of realms
With various different displays in all your pores.


---

They appear in accordance with all the aspirations
Of those you purify in the various existences of beings. {28}
34. 84
“Whoever rejoices on hearing your name
Will easily attain their goals and live well.
Whatever being sees your body
Will be facing the path to enlightenment. {29}
34. 85
“Merely seeing you causes the kleśas to cease
In one who rejoices on hearing your name.
I would endure countless kalpas in the lower realms
So that I could see your face. {30}
34. 86
“If I were to create as many bodies as there are atoms in a thousand realms,
And for the duration of that same number of kalpas
They were to describe the qualities of just one of your pores,
They would never be able to reach the end of that description.” {31}
34. 87
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
night goddess Vāsantī, circumambulated the night goddess Vāsantī many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back
again and again with unfulfilled longing, departed from the night goddess
Vāsantī. [B6] [F.91.b]
