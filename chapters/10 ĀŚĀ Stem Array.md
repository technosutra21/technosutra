Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, delighted by the qualities of the
kalyāṇamitra, [F.364.b] sent forth by the kalyāṇamitra, empowered by the
sight of the kalyāṇamitra, practicing the instructions of the kalyāṇamitra,
remembering the words of the kalyāṇamitra,
 and contemplating the
kalyāṇamitra with affection, saw kalyāṇamitras as the source of the
Buddhadharma, saw kalyāṇamitras as the teachers of the Buddhadharma,
saw kalyāṇamitras as masters
 in the Dharma of omniscience, and saw the
kalyāṇamitras as eyes that look into the sky of buddhahood.

Eventually he came to the Samanta vyūha Park in Samudravetāḍī. He saw
the Samanta vyūha Park, which was encircled by precious walls and rows
of precious trees that were perfectly adorned and by rows
 of beautiful,
delicate flowers, made of all precious materials, that released clouds of
pollen that were spread across the ground.
 It was adorned by trees made
of all precious materials. It was filled with a variety of blossoming flowers of
precious trees. The beautiful aroma from rows
 of various incense trees
spread in every direction. Strings of all kinds of jewels were hanging from
the various trees like a rainfall of strings of jewels showering down. The
trees made of all the kings of jewels were bestrewed, bedecked, and
beautified by a variety of precious jewels. All the wish-fulfilling flower trees
were beautified and covered by being draped with clothing of various colors.
When all the musical trees were moved by the breeze there came the
beautiful sound of music from instruments superior to those of the devas.
The ground was perfectly level, and upon it was the display of all the
various kinds of adorned trees [F.365.a] that were hung and beautified with

In the center of Samanta vyūha Park there was a great aerial palace
[F.365.b] called Vicitra dhvaja. It had a floor made of jewels from within the

was a cloud of a million bodhisattvas listening to the Dharma and sending

10. 12
The upāsikā Āśā was seated there on a great throne of the essence of gold,
wearing a crown of a net of pearls, the essences of the sea; wearing on her
arms gold armlets and bracelets transcending those of the devas; her arms
adorned by precious jewels shining with glorious light rays; wearing
precious, stainless, dark blue pendant earrings; her head beautifully adorned

by a net of precious jewels; wearing precious lion-face jewels on the upper
part of her ears; wearing a necklace of precious king of wish-fulfilling jewels
at her throat; her body covered in a brightly shining net of all jewels.
10. 13
A quintillion beings were bowing down to her in homage. In front of this
upāsikā, there came from the eastern direction [F.367.a] countless,
innumerable beings: Mahābrahmās, court priests of Brahmās, and
Brahmakāyika 
devas, 
Vaśavartins 
and 
Para nirmita vaśa vartin 
devas,

Vaśavartins, Para nirmita vaśa vartin devas, and so on, up to lords of humans

10. 15
All those who suffered from various illnesses, were mired in various
kleśas, were attached to various wrong views, or were obscured by karmic
obscurations, as soon as they saw Upāsikā Āśā, [F.367.b] were healed of their
illnesses, became freed from the kleśas that stained their minds,
 departed
from their erroneous views, had all their mountains of obscurations
destroyed, and entered the pure field of freedom from obscurations, and
within that pure field they purified all their roots of merit, caused all the
seedlings of their faculties to grow, became dedicated to the ocean of the
way of omniscient wisdom, entered the entire ocean of the gateways to the
power of retention, faced the entire ocean of the gateways of samādhis,
developed all the gateways of prayer, gave rise to all the gateways of
conduct, purified all the gateways of the accomplishment of qualities, gave
rise to the ways of all the clairvoyances of a vast mind, and could go
anywhere with unimpeded bodies.
544
10. 16
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, entered the Samanta vyūha Park,
looked around at everything, and saw the upāsikā Āśā seated on a
magnificent throne. He approached the upāsikā Āśā and, having reached
her, bowed his head to the feet of the upāsikā Āśā. He circumambulated her,
keeping her to his right, many hundreds of thousands of times and then
said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it. [F.368.a] Āryā,


---

I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray
that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct
and how they should practice it!”
10. 17
The upāsikā Āśā said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the banner of bliss without sorrow. Noble one, through its power
it is beneficial to see me, it is beneficial to hear me, it is beneficial to honor
me, it is beneficial to be in one place with me, and it is beneficial to remember
me.
10. 18
“Noble one, when beings who have not developed the roots of merit, have
not become pupils of a kalyāṇamitra, and have no intention to attain
complete buddhahood look at me, I do not appear within their field of vision.
10. 19
“Noble one, merely through seeing me, beings become irreversible on the
path to the highest, complete enlightenment.
10. 20
“Moreover, noble one, tathāgatas come from the east into my presence,
and they sit on precious thrones and teach the Dharma. And just as they
come from the east, they come in that way from the ten directions.
10. 21
“Therefore, noble one, I am never without the sight of the tathāgatas, I am
never without the teaching of the Dharma, and I am never without the
company of bodhisattvas.
10. 22
“Noble one, eighty-four hundred thousand quintillion beings who have
the same level of conduct as me are present in this Samanta vyūha Park. They
are all irreversibly progressing to the highest, complete enlightenment.
[F.368.b]
10. 23
“Noble one, all the other beings who are present here will also progress
irreversibly to the highest, complete enlightenment and will be included
within the irreversible saṅgha and have the same level of conduct as
myself.”
10. 24
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, how long have you had the aspiration to attain the
highest, complete enlightenment?”
The upāsikā Āśā answered, “Noble one, I remember my past lives. There
was the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named Dīpaṅkara. I took the
vows of celibacy in the presence of that tathāgata. I made offerings to that
tathāgata. I obtained the teaching of the Dharma from that tathāgata. Before
him there was a tathāgata named Vimala. I entered homelessness within his
teaching, and I also obtained his wheel of the Dharma. Before him there was
a tathāgata named Ketu, and I propitiated him. Before him there was a
tathāgata named Meruśrī. Before him there was a tathāgata named Padma-
garbha. Before him there was a tathāgata named Vairocana. Before him there
was a tathāgata named Samanta cakṣu. Before him there was a tathāgata
named Brahmaśuddha. Before him there was a tathāgata named Vajranābhi.
Before him there was a tathāgata named Varuṇadeva.

10. 25
“Noble one, in that way I think of and remember the continuous sequence
of one life after another, one kalpa after another, and the successions of one
buddha after another, [F.369.a] remembering tathāgatas as numerous as the
grains of sand in thirty-six Ganges Rivers, whom I served, propitiated, made
offerings to, honored, and heard the Dharma from and within whose
teaching I practiced the conduct of celibacy.
10. 26
“Noble one, the tathāgatas know how many tathāgatas beyond that I have
honored.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because they fill the realm
of phenomena through developing the aspiration for enlightenment for the
first time.
10. 27
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through great
compassion they enter into all worlds.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through great
prayers they are based upon every level in the ten directions of the realm of
phenomena.
10. 28
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through their
great love they are spread among all beings.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through their
bodhisattva conduct they include all kalpas in all realms.
10. 29
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of samādhi they are irreversible on the bodhisattva path.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of retention they realize the way of retention that supports all beings.
10. 30
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of the radiance of knowledge they realize and possess the way of the
knowledge of the three times. [F.369.b]
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of clairvoyance they accomplish wheels of nets of light in accordance
with the thoughts and aspirations of beings in all realms.
10. 31
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of discernment they can satisfy all beings by uttering just one word.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
purity of their bodies they pervade all the buddha realms with their bodies.”
10. 32
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, at which twilight will you attain the highest,
complete enlightenment of buddhahood?”
Āśā answered, “Noble one, it is like this: bodhisattvas do not develop the
aspiration for enlightenment with the intention of guiding and ripening
one
 being, or a hundred
 beings, or a thousand
 beings, or a hundred
thousand
 beings, or ten million
 beings, or a thousand million beings,
