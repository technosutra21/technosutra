Chapter 6
SUPRATIṢṬHITA
6. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembering the instructions of
the kalyāṇamitra and the Dharma teaching called All-Seeing Eyes,
contemplating the miracles of that tathāgata, keeping in his mind the clouds
of the words and terms of that Dharma, [F.333.a] comprehending that ocean
of Dharma gateways, observing the precepts of that Dharma, entering
those ways of turning toward
 the Dharma, absorbed into the sky of that
Dharma, purifying the range of that Dharma, and meditating on the precious
continent
 of that Dharma, eventually arrived at Sāgara tīra in the Laṅka
region.
 Wishing to see the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita, he looked for him in the
eastern direction. In the same way, wishing to see the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita,
he looked for him everywhere: in the southern direction, in the western
direction, in the northern direction, in the northeastern direction, in the
southeastern direction, in the southwestern direction, in the northwestern
direction, above, and below.

6. 2
Then he saw the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita walking back and forth in the sky
accompanied by countless hundreds of thousands of devas.
6. 3
He saw deva lords in the sky making offerings to the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita
with clouds of scattered divine flower petals, the sound of countless clouds
of divine music, and countless adorning streamers and banners.
6. 4
He saw that nāga lords in the sky had created high clouds, made of the
spreading incense smoke of black agarwood, from which came
inconceivable claps of thunder.
6. 5
He heard kinnara lords offering their divine beautiful voices in songs of
praise and the sounds of a concert with all musical instruments being
played.
6. 6
He saw mahoraga lords in the sky joyfully and with faith bringing forth an
inconceivable cloud of fine clothing in beautiful colors,
 [F.333.b] with the
appearance of delighting in the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita.

6. 7
He saw asura lords in the sky conjuring an inconceivable cloud of
precious jewels shining with an inconceivable display of qualities.
6. 8
He saw a gathered multitude of garuḍa lords in human form, color,
 and
shape, encircled by the daughters of the garuḍa lords, delighting
 in
nonviolence
 and with their palms together in homage.
382
383
384
6. 9
He saw an inconceivable hundred thousand yakṣa lords, arranged with
their retinues in the sky, who had very ugly bodies and the power of love
toward the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita.
6. 10
He saw an inconceivable hundred thousand rākṣasa lords with their
retinues in the sky who circled around the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita, guarding
him.
6. 11
He saw an inconceivable hundred thousand Brahmakāyika lords with
their retinues in the sky with their palms together in homage, engaged in
singing his praises with beautiful, melodious voices.
6. 12
He saw an inconceivable hundred thousand Śuddhāvāsa devas in their
aerial palaces in the sky making offerings to the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita.
6. 13
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, on seeing the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita
walking in the sky, was filled with joy, delighted, elated, pleased, and happy.
He placed his palms together in homage and said, “Ārya, I have developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know
this —how should a bodhisattva seek for the Buddhadharma? [F.334.a] How
should a bodhisattva obtain the Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva
compile the Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva serve
 the
Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva protect
 the Buddhadharma?
How should a bodhisattva follow the Buddhadharma? How should a
bodhisattva accumulate
 the Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva
pervade
 the Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva purify the
Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva train in the Buddhadharma?
How should a bodhisattva understand the Buddhadharma?
385
386
387
388
389
6. 14
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas should practice
the Buddhadharma so that while practicing they will not lack the sight of the
Buddha in order to not become separated from the truth; will not lack the
vision of the bodhisattvas in order to have the same way
 as the roots of
merit of all bodhisattvas; will not lack the Buddhadharma in order to realize
wisdom; will not lack the bodhisattva aspiration in order to attain all the
goals of the bodhisattvas; will not lack bodhisattva conduct in order to never
become weary of remaining throughout all kalpas; will not lack the
pervading of all buddha realms in order to purify all world realms; [F.334.b]
will not lack seeing the miracles of buddhas in order to perceive all the
miraculous manifestations of all the tathāgatas; will not lack a composite
390

presence so that through bodhisattva conduct that is like a magical creation
they will experience as their own bodies the āyatanas that are born and pass
away within all existences; will not lack hearing the Dharma in order to
obtain the clouds of Dharma of all the tathāgatas; and will not lack the light
of wisdom in order to gain and use the knowledge of the three times.”391
6. 15
When he had said this, the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita said to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment and that
you ask questions about the Buddha’s Dharma, the Dharma of omniscience,
the self-arisen Dharma.
6. 16
“Noble one, I have the attainment of the unimpeded gateway, the
liberation of a bodhisattva. I have acquired, followed, categorized, analyzed,
examined, and elucidated this unimpeded gateway, this liberation of a
bodhisattva, and I have attained the light of wisdom called the unimpeded
apex. Having attained that, I have no impediment in perceiving the minds
and conduct of all beings; I have no impediment in knowing the births and
deaths of all beings; I have no impediment in entering the gateway of
remembering past lives; I have no impediment in dwelling with all beings in
future kalpas; [F.335.a] I have no impediment in perceiving all the beings of
the present time; I have no impediment in knowing the relative languages of
all beings; I have no impediment in cutting through the doubts of all beings;
I have no impediment in comprehending the different faculties of all beings;
I have no impediment in acting at the right time to ripen and guide all
beings; I have no impediment in identifying days, nights, seconds, hours,
and periods of time; I have no impediment in entering into the ocean of the
three times;
 and I have no impediment in incorporeally
 pervading the
buddha realms in the ten directions, because I am present without substance
and have attained noncomposite miraculous powers.
392
393
394
6. 17
“Noble one, because I am present without substance and have the power
of noncomposite miraculous powers, I can walk back and forth, stand,
 sit,
lie down, and perform various activities in the sky. I can become invisible. I
can reappear. I can become smoke. I can become a fire. [F.335.b] I can
transform from one into many. I can transform from many into one. I can be
both visible and invisible. I can pass without impediment through walls and
without impediment through city ramparts, as if through space.
 I travel
cross-legged through the air, as a bird does. I can plunge into the earth and
reappear the way a bird does in water. I can walk on water without sinking
like a bird on the ground. I can produce smoke and flames the way a great
fire does. I can make the ground shake. I can wipe clean with my hands this
sun and this moon that have such great miraculous power, great mightiness,
and great brilliance. My body can dominate everywhere up to and including
395

the world of Brahmā. I can cover the world with a mist formed from clouds of
incense smoke and then make it shine. I can cover the world with a network
of clouds of light rays from all jewels. I can send forth a cloud of emanations
that resemble all beings.
6. 18
“I can emanate clouds of networks of lights of infinite colors that go to all
directions and realms. In that way, they go to the east, to the south, to the
west, to the north, to the northeast, to the southeast, to the southwest, to the
northwest, downward, and upward. In one instant of mind, they go beyond
one world realm in the east.
6. 19
“They go beyond two world realms and ten world realms. They go beyond
a hundred world realms. They go beyond a thousand world realms, a
hundred thousand world realms, ten million world realms, a billion world
realms, a trillion world realms, a quintillion world realms, an incalculable
number of world realms, a measureless number of world realms, [F.336.a]
innumerable world realms, an inconceivable number of world realms, an
unequaled number of world realms, an unfathomable number of world
realms, an infinite number of world realms, an endless number of world
realms, limitless world realms, and an inexpressible number of world realms.
6. 20
“All the buddha bhagavats that are present, living, and remaining in those
world realms, in that ocean of world realms, in that vast extent of world
realms, in the world realms in the directions, in the world realms that are
coming to an end, in the world realms that are assembled, in the world
realms that are created, in those world realms that are named, in the
gateways of those world realms, in the kalpas of those world realms, in the
entrances into those world realms, and at the bodhimaṇḍas of those world
realms, those buddha bhagavats who are teaching the Dharma in the circle
of their assembled followers in those world realms —each of the tathāgatas
among those tathāgatas has a variety of bodies that are as numerous as the
atoms in the infinite buddha realms. I approach each of those bodies while
sending down a rain from clouds of offering as numerous as the atoms in the
infinite buddha realms. Having approached them, I make a continuous
offering of all flowers, all incense, all garlands, all powders, all ointments, all
food, all banners, all flags, all canopies, all networks of beads, and all
ornaments.397
6. 21
“I know and remember whatever all those buddha bhagavats [F.336.b] say,
teach, utter, explain, describe, elucidate, instruct, proclaim, and disclose.
6. 22
“I remember all the pure buddha realms of those buddha bhagavats. As it
is in the east, so it is in the south, the west, the north, the northeast, the
southeast, the southwest, the northwest, above and below, beyond one

world realm, beyond two world realms and ten world realms, beyond a
hundred world realms, and so on, up to beyond as many world realms as
there are atoms in even more innumerable than innumerable buddha realms.
6. 23
“I see all the buddha bhagavats that are present, living, and remaining in
those world realms, in that ocean of world realms, in those pure world
realms, who are teaching the Dharma in the circle of their followers. I make
offerings to those tathāgatas with all flowers, and so on, up to all
ornaments.
 I know and remember whatever all those buddha bhagavats
say, and so on, and what they disclose. I remember all the pure buddha
realms that there are of those buddha bhagavats.
398
6. 24
“Whatever being sees me, who associates with me, will definitely attain
the highest, complete enlightenment. [F.337.a] Whether they are small or
huge, good or bad, happy or unhappy beings, however many of them see
me, I will bless all of their bodies and I will not let the time to ripen and
guide them pass. However many beings come before me, I will establish all
of them in this bodhisattva liberation that goes everywhere and has fruitful
prowess.
6. 25
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation that goes everywhere,
which is dedicated to making offerings and serving the tathāgatas and
which is an unimpeded gateway favorable for ripening all beings.
6. 26
“How could I know or describe the qualities of the bodhisattvas who have
the conduct of great compassion, who have the conduct of practicing the
Mahāyāna, who have the conduct that is never apart from the path of the
bodhisattvas, who have unimpeded conduct, who have the conduct of the
essence of bodhisattva motivation that is never lost, who have the conduct
that never forsakes the aspiration to enlightenment, who have the conduct
that is focused on the Buddhadharma, who have the conduct that is never
apart from attention to omniscience, who have the conduct that is as vast as
space, who have the conduct that is not based on the world, who have the
conduct that is never lost, who have the conduct that never deteriorates,
who have the conduct that is never impaired, who have the conduct that is
never destroyed, who have the conduct that is never adulterated, who have
the conduct that is never polluted, who have the conduct that is without
regret, who have pure conduct, and who have bodhisattva conduct that is
stainless? [F.337.b]
6. 27
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land of Draviḍa, there is
a town called Vajrapura. There dwells a Dravidian by the name of Megha. Go
to him and ask him, ‘How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How does a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”

6. 28
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita, circumambulated the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita to his right a
hundred thousand times, and, looking back a hundred thousand times,
departed from the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita.
