SAMANTA SATTVA TRĀṆOJAḤ ŚRĪ
37. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, aspiring to the night goddess
Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā’s samādhi of the bodhisattva liberation
called the banner of the power
 of vast, stainless, completely good joy,
comprehending it, understanding it, knowing it, believing in it, undertaking
it, pervading it, recollecting it, remembering it, and meditating on it,
practicing the instruction of the kalyāṇamitra and memorizing the
instruction given by the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā in
order to maintain the continuity of the teaching of instruction, approached
the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī. Through contemplating
seeing a kalyāṇamitra, through the domain of all his faculties,
 by going
from place to place
 to obtain the sight of a kalyāṇamitra, through looking
in all directions, through being intent on searching for a kalyāṇamitra,
through being free from all pride, [F.113.b] through the prowess
 of
pleasing a kalyāṇamitra, through being resolved to create a great
accumulation of merit, through having become single-mindedly intent upon
a kalyāṇamitra,
 and through all his roots of merit,
 he had gained the
unwavering motivation for a kalyāṇamitra’s conduct of skillful methods, had
developed an ocean of the power of diligence for increasing reliance on a
kalyāṇamitra, and had prayed to dwell with and follow kalyāṇamitras
equally in all kalpas.

37. 2
As he approached her, the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, in
order to demonstrate the supreme might of the limitless bodhisattva
liberation called the manifestations that guide beings that appear in all worlds,
revealed her body, which had the complete beautiful signs and features of a
great being. She then radiated from her ūrṇā hair a ray of light called the
banner of stainless light that is a lamp of the complete radiance of wisdom,


---

accompanied by light rays without end or center. They illuminated all worlds
and then descended into the crown of the head of Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, and spread throughout his entire body.
37. 3
As soon as Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was touched by those light
rays, he instantly attained the samādhi called the area that is completely free of
particles.1439
37. 4
Because he had attained that, he saw the area of ground that was the route
between the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā and the night
goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī as being made of atoms of fire; or atoms
of water; or atoms of earth; or atoms of diamond; or atoms of various great
kings of precious jewels; or atoms of flowers, incense, and powders; [F.114.a]
or atoms of all precious arrays; or atoms of all locations. In each atom there
were world realms as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm.
37. 5
He saw that they had aggregations of water, had aggregations of fire, had
aggregations of air, had aggregations of earth, had world-realm
boundaries,
 had bases, had foundations, had different shapes, had
surfaces of various kinds of different forms, had different kinds of encircling
mountains, had various kinds of encircling oceans, had arrays of various
kinds of buildings made of divine materials, had various kinds of trees, had
various adornments in the sky, had the adornment of the buildings of the
cities of devas, had the adornment of the buildings of the cities of nāgas, had
the adornment of the buildings of the cities of yakṣas, had the adornment of
the buildings of the cities of gandharvas, had the adornment of the buildings
of the cities of the asuras, had the adornment of the buildings of the cities of
garuḍas, had the adornment of the buildings of the cities of kinnaras, had
the adornment of the buildings of the cities of mahoragas, had the
adornment of the buildings of the cities of humans, had the adornment of the
buildings of the cities of all beings in the main and intermediate directions,
had the realm of the world of hells, had the realm of the world of animals,
had the realm of the world of Yama, had the realm of the death and rebirth of
humans and nonhumans,
 had various kinds of births, and had the
accumulation and destruction of various kinds of existences.
1440
1441
37. 6
He saw various kinds of differences between those worlds: he saw some
worlds that were defiled, [F.114.b] some that were pure, some that were
completely defiled, some that were purified of ordinary existences, some that
were purified of defilements, some that were both pure and defiled, some
that were completely pure, some that were a flat surface, some that were
upside-down, and some that were disordered, and he saw how in all the
existences of beings, in all the births of beings in those world realms, the
night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī became present for all those beings
in order to guide them according to their circumstances.


---

37. 7
He saw her becoming present separately for every being in order to ripen
and guide them in accordance with their lifespans; the various scopes of
their aspirations; the forms of their bodies; their languages, terminology, and
established definitions; the forms of their practices; and their dominance.
37. 8
This means that he saw her becoming present separately for every being
in order to dispel the fear of the various sufferings of hell for the beings who
were in hell existences; in order to dispel in beings among the various
animals the fear of being eaten by one another; in order to dispel the fear of
the suffering of hunger, thirst, and so on for beings within Yama’s realm; in
order to dispel all fear of the suffering of nāgas for those in nāga existences;
[F.115.a] in order to dispel all fear of the sufferings of the desire realm for all
beings within the desire realms; in order to dispel in those who existed in the
human world all fear of being bewildered in the darkness of night; in order
to dispel the fear of blame and infamy for those who were preoccupied with
criticism, blame, and infamy; in order to dispel the fear of anxiety before an
assembly for those beings who had the fear of anxiety before an assembly; in
order to dispel the fear of death in those beings who were frightened and
terrified of death; in order to dispel the fear of the abyss of the lower
existences for those beings who were frightened and terrified of the abyss of
the lower realms; in order to dispel the fear of having no livelihood for those
beings who were frightened and terrified of having no livelihood; in order to
dispel the fear of the loss of their roots of merit for those beings who were
frightened of losing their roots of merit; in order to dispel the fear of a
diminution of the aspiration for enlightenment for those beings who were
afraid of a diminution of their aspiration for enlightenment; in order to dispel
the fear of meeting bad companions for those beings who were frightened of
meeting bad companions; in order to dispel the fear of separation from
kalyāṇamitras in those beings who were frightened of separation from
kalyāṇamitras; [F.115.b] in order to dispel the fear of falling to the level of
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas in those beings who were frightened of
falling to the level of śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas; in order to dispel the
fear of the various kinds of suffering in saṃsāra for those beings who were
afraid of the various kinds of suffering in saṃsāra; in order to dispel the fear
of meeting contrary beings for those beings who were frightened and afraid
of meeting contrary beings; in order to dispel the fear of unfortunate times in
those beings who were frightened and afraid of unfortunate times; in order
to dispel the fear of rebirth into unfortunate families in those beings who
were frightened and afraid of rebirth into unfortunate families; in order to
dispel the fear of committing bad actions for those beings who were
frightened and afraid of committing bad actions; in order to dispel the fear of
the obscurations of karma and kleśas for those beings who were frightened


---

and afraid of the obscurations of karma and kleśas; and in order to dispel the
fear of the bondage of remaining fixed in a variety of conceptions for those
beings who were frightened and afraid of remaining fixed in a variety of
conceptions.
37. 9
This means he saw her, being present in and purifying all realms, through
possessing the supremacy of the vast miraculous powers of bodhisattva
liberation and through the accomplishment of the power of the prayer to
protect all beings: beings born from eggs, born from wombs, born from warm
moisture, born spontaneously, and with form, without form, with perception,
without perception, and neither with perception nor without perception;
through the vast prowess of the power of bodhisattva samādhi; [F.116.a]
through the power of the great higher cognitions of a bodhisattva; through
the power of attaining the completely good conduct and prayer of a
bodhisattva; and through developing the power of an ocean of the ways of
compassion; in order to spread everywhere the great love for all beings that
is free of attachment; in order to create happiness for all beings and increase
the power of their joy; and so that all beings will accomplish the
accumulation of wisdom.
1442
37. 10
He saw her focused on knowing the knowledge of all Dharmas; being
present there focused on making offerings and honoring all buddhas;
focused on holding the teachings of all the tathāgatas; focused on the
accumulation of all roots of merit; focused on the increase of all bodhisattva
conduct; focused on the minds of all beings being free of obscurations;
focused on ripening the faculties of all beings; focused on purifying the
ocean of the aspirations of all beings; focused on dispelling obscuring
qualities in all beings; focused on dispersing the darkness of ignorance in all
beings;
 and focused on creating the light of omniscient wisdom. [F.116.b]
1443
37. 11
When Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had seen this miraculous
prowess of the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī’s inconceivable
bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that guide beings that appear in all
worlds, he was overjoyed and acquired an ocean of the power of great
delight.
37. 12
He prostrated with his entire body before the night goddess Samanta-
sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī and then stood and gazed upon
 her.
1444
37. 13
Then the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī made her appearance in
the pure form and physical signs of a bodhisattva vanish, and she remained
in the form of a night goddess emanating all miraculous manifestations.
37. 14
At that time, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, standing with hands
together in homage before the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī,
recited these verses to her:
37. 15
“I have seen your vast
 body
1445


---

Adorned by the excellent, beautiful signs1446
And the wonderful special features,
Like the sky adorned by stars. {1}
37. 16
“Your perfect, beautiful body’s halo of light rays
As numerous as the atoms in infinite realms,
With its multicolored, incomparable
 radiance,
1447
Spreads throughout the extent of every direction. {2}
37. 17
“From the pores of your body shine
As many networks of light rays as there are minds of beings.
At the tip of each light ray an emanation of yours,
Seated upon a beautiful lotus, eliminates the sufferings of beings. {3}
37. 18
“Clouds of incense mists are emitted,
Taking on the forms of beautiful beings.
Flowers spread out everywhere [F.117.a]
To all the jinas in the realm of phenomena. {4}
37. 19
“The vast, sublime mass of your shoulders1448
Shines with stainless jewel light, the size of Mount Meru,
With which you illuminate all beings,
Dispelling the darkness of ignorance. {5}
37. 20
“Vast masses of clouds of suns
 are emanated
1449
From your beautifully colored, stainless
 face.
1450
Your wonderful light, which is like the disk of the sun,
Is emanated throughout Vairocana’s vast field of activity. {6}
37. 21
“Clouds of the stainless light of the moon and the stars
Are constantly emanated from your eyes.
They spread throughout the ten directions,
Illuminating beings and eliminating the world’s blindness. {7}
37. 22
“An ocean of emanations as numerous as the bodies of beings
Is emanated into all directions from your physical signs of a great being.
They spread throughout the vast realm of phenomena
And guide
 the immeasurable multitudes of beings. {8}
1451
37. 23
“Your body appears throughout the extent of the directions,
Appearing to all beings and bringing them happiness,
Dispelling and alleviating all fears
Created by kings, fire, thieves, and water. {9}
37. 24
“When I was sent into your presence,


---

I approached you contemplating good qualities.
At that time a beautiful, stainless mass of light rays
Radiated from between your eyebrows. {10}
37. 25
“They illuminated hundreds of oceans of directions
And created a vast radiance in the world.
They revealed many miraculous manifestations,
And at that time they entered into my body. {11}
37. 26
“When that mass of light touched me,
At that time I experienced a marvelous bliss.
I gained mastery of many hundreds of dhāraṇīs and samādhis,
And I saw limitless jinas in the ten directions. {12}
37. 27
“Wherever I stepped with my feet
I could perceive the number of atoms there,
And I saw in every single atom
Realms as numerous as a realm’s atoms. {13} [F.117.b]
37. 28
“There were many hundreds of defiled realms
Of many different kinds, located in atoms
In which beings experienced suffering,
Crying out with the sounds of lamentation and wailing. {14}
37. 29
“There were also many realms both defiled and pure,
In which there was much suffering and little happiness,
In which the compassionate jinas took birth,
As did the jinas’ śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas.
 {15}
1452
37. 30
“There were some realms, purified of defilements,
That were ornamented by the presence of many bodhisattvas
And adorned by beautiful men and women,
And the brilliant family of the jinas resided there. {16}
37. 31
“There were vast, stainless oceans of realms,
With level surfaces, that were located in atoms,
Where for many hundreds of kalpas
Vairocana purified his conduct in the past. {17}
37. 32
“Within that entire vast extent of realms,
Jinas were revealed going to the lord of trees,
Attaining enlightenment, manifesting miracles,
Turning the wheel of the Dharma, and guiding beings. {18}
37. 33
“And I saw you also following


---

In the vast scope of Vairocana’s activity
And making offerings equally to all the jinas
With countless millions of billions of offerings.” {19}
37. 34
When Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had recited those verses, he said to
the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, “Goddess, that profound
bodhisattva liberation is a great wonder. What is the name of that liberation?
How long ago did you attain it? How does a bodhisattva practice in order to
purify that bodhisattva liberation?”
37. 35
The night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī said, “Noble one, this subject
is difficult to believe in for the world and its devas, as well as for the
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas. Why is that? Because it is the field of
practice of those bodhisattvas who follow the completely good conduct and
prayer of the bodhisattvas; [F.118.a] who are dedicated to the essence of
compassion; who are engaged in saving all beings; who purify the paths that
lead to all unfortunate and lower realms; who purify all realms to become the
highest buddha realms; who create the unbroken continuity of the Buddha’s
family in all buddha realms; who hold the teachings of all the buddhas; who
have oceans of great prayers for remaining in the practice of bodhisattva
conduct throughout all kalpas; and who create the pure light of wisdom, free
of darkness, for all the oceans of Dharma; and those bodhisattvas who in
each instant have attained the state of remaining in the light of wisdom of
the entire ocean of the ways of the three times. However, through the
blessing of the Tathāgata, I will teach it.
37. 36
“Noble one, in the past beyond kalpas as numerous as the atoms in a
buddha realm, there was a world realm called Vairocana tejaḥśrī during a
kalpa called Virajomaṇḍala. In that kalpa there appeared as many buddhas
as there are atoms in Sumeru. In that world realm called Vairocana tejaḥśrī
there was an array of clouds of all jewels, and it was beautified by aerial
palaces made of diamonds.
37. 37
“That world realm was situated on a foundation of an ocean of the kings
of jewels possessing stainless light. Its solid body
 was formed from
precious jewels possessing all the kings of perfumes. It was completely
round in shape. It was both pure and defiled. It was covered by a canopy of
clouds of every adornment. [F.118.b] It had the array of a thousand precious
Cakravāla mountains. It was adorned by a quintillion four-continent worlds.
Some four-continent worlds were defiled and were the dwelling places of
beings who had defiled karma. Some were the dwelling places of beings
who had a mixture
 of both defiled and pure karma. Some were the
dwelling places of beings who were pure and also defiled, who had pure
good actions and few blameworthy actions. Some were the dwelling places
of pure bodhisattvas.
1453
1454


---

37. 38
“To the east of the world realm Vairocana tejaḥśrī, next to the Cakravāla
mountains, there was a four-continent world called Ratna kusuma pradīpa-
dhvajā. It was pure but defiled. There beings enjoyed the unplowed harvests.
They lived in kūṭāgāras and aerial palaces that were created by the ripening
of their past karma. It was encircled by wish-fulfilling trees. There were
various kinds of aromatic trees that continually released clouds of perfume.
There were various kinds of garland trees that continually released clouds of
garlands. There were various kinds of flowering trees from which fell a
continuous rain of clouds of flowers with inconceivable colors and scents.
There were various kinds of colored-powder trees from which fell a
continuous rain of the powders of all the kings of precious scents. There
were various kinds of jewel trees from which fell many jewel seed-pods
that shone with various colors. [F.119.a] There were trees of various kinds of
divine music from which were emanated clouds of the sound of music. From
the sky came melodious sounds. Day and night, there was the pleasant light
of the sun and moon. The ground, which shone with all precious jewels, was
level.
1455
37. 39
“In those four continents there were a quintillion royal cities. Each of
those royal cities was encircled by a thousand rivers. All those rivers were
filled with the petals of divine flowers. They emitted the melodious, beautiful
sounds of divine music and song. Their banks were adorned by beautiful
precious trees. Boats adorned by various jewels crossed back and forth.
Every kind of happiness that could be delighted in was enjoyed there. In
between each river a quintillion towns had been established. Each of those
towns was encircled by a quintillion markets. All those villages, cities, and
markets were encircled by a quintillion divine parks, aerial palaces, and
mansions. In the center of the Jambudvīpa of that four-continent world was
the central royal city, which was called Ratna kusuma pradīpā.
37. 40
“This was a place that was prosperous and wealthy, with an abundance of
food;
 it had every kind of happiness and was filled with many devas and
humans, and the beings there followed the path of the ten good actions.
[F.119.b]
1456
37. 41
“Here dwelled King Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa, a cakravartin
who was sovereign over the four continents. He had been spontaneously
born from the center of a lotus flower, was adorned by the thirty-two signs of
a great being, was a follower of the Dharma, a Dharma king, and possessed
the seven jewels of a cakravartin.
37. 42
“He had a full thousand sons who were courageous and heroic,
 who
had perfectly formed bodies, who crushed the armies of enemies
 and had
perfect bodies fully formed in all aspects.
1457
1458


---

37. 43
“In his harem there were a quintillion women, all of whom had originated
from roots of merit that corresponded to those of the cakravartin, who had
the same conduct as he had, were born adorned with jewels,
 had virtuous
minds, and had bodies that were no different from those of goddesses,
bodies that were the color of Jambu River gold, that emitted various divine
scents from the pores of their bodies, and that shone with a pure, aromatic,
divine light.
1459
“He had millions of ministers such as the precious prime minister.1460
37. 44
“The cakravartin king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa’s queen
named Saṃpūrṇa śrīvakrā was the precious woman. She was beautiful,
attractive, and lovely to look at. She possessed an excellent, magnificent,
perfect color. Her hair was deep black. She had deep black eyes.
 She had
golden skin. She had the voice of Brahmā. Light continually shone from her
body. She spread lights of various colors and divine aromas for a thousand
yojanas around her.
1461
37. 45
“Saṃpūrṇa śrīvakrā, the king’s queen, [F.120.a] had the cakravartin’s
daughter named Padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā.
 
She 
had 
a
completely perfect body. She was beautiful, attractive, and lovely to look at.
The whole world never had enough of looking at her. For example, noble
one, just as no one was ever satisfied that they had seen enough of the
cakravartin, in the same way no one was ever satisfied that they had seen
enough of the cakravartin’s daughter Padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī, except
for those who had gained the satisfaction of wisdom.
1462
37. 46
“At that time, in that time, beings had an immeasurable lifespan. There
was no definite lifespan, so death occurred during it.
 At that time, beings
had various shapes, various colors, various voices, various names, various
families, various lifespans, and different sizes; different aspirations,
strengths, diligences, and powers; different beautiful and ugly appearances;
and various higher and lower aspirations.
1463
37. 47
“Those beings who had good color, high aspirations, and perfect bodies
and were beautiful and lovely to look at said, ‘Oh! We have a much better
color than you!’
37. 48
“In the same way, those beings who had an excellent body shape were
dismissive and arrogant toward those beings who had ugly body shapes. In
that way, they did not care about each other, so that through the roots of
demerit, their lifespans diminished. Even their color, strength, and
happiness diminished.
37. 49
“To the north of the royal capital Ratna kusuma pradīpā there was the
bodhimaṇḍa tree called Samantāvabhāsana dharma megha nirghoṣa dhvaja
that manifested in each instant the display of the bodhimaṇḍas of all
tathāgatas. [F.120.b] Its roots were as hard and indestructible as diamond,


---

the king of jewels. Its bulk was made from all precious jewels and was vast
and huge. Its trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit were made from all
jewels. It was perfectly symmetrical. It had branches that spread everywhere.
It was a spreading, unceasing display. It shone with the lights of various
jewels, its light rays shining everywhere. It resounded with descriptions of
the miraculous manifestations that were the scope of all the tathāgatas.
37. 50
“In front of that bodhimaṇḍa there was a lake of scented water called
Ratna kusuma vidyuddharma nigarjita megha ghoṣa. It was encircled by a
quintillion precious trees, and all those precious trees had the same form as
the Bodhi tree.
37. 51
“All the banks of that great lake of scented water called Ratna kusuma-
vidyuddharma nigarjita megha ghoṣa were covered with a splendid array of
all precious jewels, decorated by various strings of all jewels, adorned by an
array of mansions made of pure jewels, and beautified by an array of all pure
adornments.
“All around the bodhimaṇḍa were countless kūṭāgāras made of precious
jewels, with lotuses in their centers.
37. 52
“In the center of the great lake of scented water called Ratna kusuma-
vidyuddharma nigarjita megha ghoṣa there was a great king of lotuses
called Sarva tryadhva tathāgata viṣaya patra saṃdhi vidyotita megha vyūha. On
that great lotus appeared a tathāgata named Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa-
ketu rāja,
 who was the very first
 from among tathāgatas as numerous
as the atoms in Sumeru. He would be the first of all of them to attain the
highest, complete enlightenment in that kalpa. [F.121.a] Having ripened
beings by teaching the Dharma for many thousands of years, he was
ripening beings for ten thousand years through the miraculous
manifestation of the radiance of light rays, and then after ten thousand years
that tathāgata would appear there.
1464
1465
1466
37. 53
“At that time, the great king of lotuses, Sarva tryadhva tathāgata viṣaya-
patra saṃdhi vidyotita megha vyūha, radiated a ray of light called Sarva sattva-
virajaḥpradīpa. The beings who were touched by that ray of light knew that
in ten thousand years a tathāgata would come.
37. 54
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in nine thousand years, the
Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Virajovatī śrī garbhā. The beings who
were touched by that ray of light saw all subtle forms.
37. 55
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in eight thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva sattva karma vipāka-
nirghoṣa. The beings who were touched by that ray of light comprehended
the ocean of their own karma and attained the wisdom that remembers
karma.


---

37. 56
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in seven thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva kuśala mūla saṃbhava-
nirghoṣā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light gained
unimpaired complete faculties.
37. 57
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in six thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Acintya buddha viṣaya nidarśana-
nirghoṣā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light made
emanations with a vast motivation.
37. 58
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in five thousand years,
[F.121.b] the great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva buddha kṣetra-
pariśuddhi nigarjita pratibhāsa vijñāpanā. The beings who were touched by
that ray of light saw with complete purity all buddha realms.
37. 59
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in four thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva tathāgata viṣayāsaṃbheda-
pradīpā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light comprehended
the all-pervading miraculous manifestations of the tathāgatas.
37. 60
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in three thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva jagad abhimukha pradīpā.
The beings who were touched by that ray of light directly saw, through their
aspiration, the tathāgatas.
37. 61
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in two thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Tryadhva jñāna vidyut pradīpā.
The beings who were touched by that ray of light realized and
comprehended the ocean of the past ways of the tathāgatas.
37. 62
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in a thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Vitimira jñāna tathāgata pradīpā.
The beings who were touched by that ray of light attained the all-seeing
view of the vision that sees all the manifestations of the tathāgatas, all
realms, and all beings.
37. 63
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in a hundred years, the great
Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva jagad buddha darśana vipāka-
kuśala mūla saṃbhavā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light
attained the perception of the arising of the tathāgatas. [F.122.a]
37. 64
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in seven days, the great
Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva sattva praharṣa prīti prāmodya-
samudaya nirghoṣā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light
developed the great power of the joy of seeing the tathāgatas.
37. 65
“Noble one, he ripened beings through that kind of immeasurable method
of ripening through light rays for a thousand years. Then, on reaching the
seventh day, he blessed the entire world realm as completely pure by


---

shaking it through an immeasurable method for shaking it. In each instant of
mind, all the pure buddha realms of all the tathāgatas in the ten directions
with their various inconceivable displays appeared in that buddha realm.
37. 66
“On the last, seventh, day, the beings in that world realm had been
ripened by the sight of the buddhas, and they all came to face the

“Then, from all that world realm’s Cakravāla mountains, from all the
Sumeru mountains, from all mountains, from all rivers, from all oceans, from
all trees, from all the surface of the ground, from all towns, from all walls,
from all dwellings, from all aerial palaces, from all clothes, jewelry, and
enjoyments, from all musical trees, from all sounds of musical instruments,
from all emanated displays, from each perceived thing, there came the
description of the range of activity and the power of all tathāgatas, and there
issued forth clouds of all incenses and perfumes; clouds of lights shining
from jewels; clouds of lights shining from all perfumes and incenses;
[F.122.b] clouds in the form of all perfume and jewels;
 clouds of all
clothing, jewels, and precious jewelry; clouds of Sumerus of various precious
flowers; many clouds of various powders; and clouds of the light rays of all
the tathāgatas. The Cakravāla mountains and so forth emitted clouds of the
halos of light of all the tathāgatas. They resounded with clouds of the music
of all instruments and drums. They emitted clouds of the sound of the
prayers of all the tathāgatas. They resounded with clouds of the aspects of
voice and the oceans of speech of all the tathāgatas. They manifested clouds
of various images of the signs and features of a great being possessed by all
the tathāgatas. They revealed countless omens of the coming of a tathāgata.

“The 
lotus 
Sarva tryadhva tathāgata viṣaya patra saṃdhi vidyotita megha-
vyūha had a retinue of great lotuses that were all made of the kings of
jewels. On the filaments and pericarps of the great lotuses that were the
retinue of the great lotus made of the kings of jewels, there were precious
lion thrones with great lotuses in their centers. They were as numerous as
the atoms in ten buddha realms. As many bodhisattvas as there are atoms in
ten buddha realms were seated cross-legged around those thrones with a
precious center.
37. 69
“The moment that tathāgata, the Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa-
ketu rāja, attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood,
many tathāgatas in world realms in the ten directions also attained the
highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood and, in accordance with
the dispositions of beings, turned the wheel of the Dharma. [F.123.a]
37. 70
“The countless beings in those world realms were turned away from all
lower realms and downfalls. Countless beings were brought to rebirth in the
higher realms. Countless beings were established on the level of the

śrāvakas. Countless beings were ripened for the enlightenment of the
pratyeka buddhas. Countless beings were ripened for the enlightenment that
arises in the light of power. Countless beings were ripened for
enlightenment in the banner of stainless diligence. Countless beings were
established in the enlightenment that arises in dwelling in meditation on the
Dharma. Countless beings were ripened for the enlightenment that arises in
meditation on the purification of the faculties. Countless beings were
ripened for the enlightenment that arises in comprehending the practice of
the equanimity of strength. Countless beings were established in the
enlightenment that arises in the emergence of the yāna with its field of
attention turned toward the city of the Dharma. Countless beings were
established in the enlightenment that arises in the yāna of the ways of
various miraculous manifestations that pervade everywhere. Countless
beings were established in the enlightenment that arises in the way of being
dedicated to practice. Countless beings were established in the
enlightenment that arises in the ways of entering samādhi. Countless beings
developed the aspiration for the enlightenment of the bodhisattvas.
Countless beings were established on the bodhisattva path. Countless
beings were established on the pure path of the perfections. [F.123.b]
Countless beings were established on the first bodhisattva bhūmi.
Countless beings were established on the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventh, eighth, and ninth bodhisattva bhūmis. Countless beings were
established on the tenth bhūmi. Countless beings were brought into the
preeminent conduct and prayers of the bodhisattvas. Countless beings were
established in the completely good conduct and prayers of the bodhisattvas.
1468
37. 71
“In that way, the Tathāgata turned the wheel of the Dharma through the
inconceivable miraculous manifestations and the power of the preeminence
of a buddha, so that in each instant of mind he guided realms of beings
without end or center.
37. 72
“All the beings of that world realm understood the Dharma taught by that
tathāgata through various bodies and the accomplishment of various skillful
methods.
37. 73
“In order to guide those beings in the royal capital Ratna kusuma pradīpā,
who were proud and arrogant because of their form, color, scope, and
enjoyments and had no care for one another, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra
manifested a supreme color and form and went to the royal capital. His halo
was so vast that it illuminated the entire royal capital.1469
37. 74
“The light of the royal capital, the light from the body of the cakravartin
king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa, the light from the precious queen,
the light from the precious trees, the light from the precious jewels, the light


---

from the sun, moon, planets, and stars, and whatever lights there were in
Jambudvīpa all ceased to shine.
37. 75
“For example, [F.124.a] when the sun shines, darkness and the light of the
moon, planets, stars, and constellations vanish, and the light from fire and
jewels vanishes. In the same way, through being outshined by the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, all the lights in Jambudvīpa vanished.
37. 76
“It is just as if, for example, you were to place some lampblack
 in front
of a lump of Jambu River gold, it would not be beautiful, would not be bright,
would not glow, and would not shine. In the same way, when the physical
forms of those beings were in front of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, they
were not beautiful, were not bright, were not glowing, and were not shining.
1470
37. 77
“They thought, ‘In front of him our bodies, light, color, and brilliance are
not beautiful, not bright, not glowing, and they do not shine. Is this a deva or
Brahmā whose attributes we are unable to comprehend?’
37. 78
“Then the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra stood in the sky above the aerial
palace of the cakravartin king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa, which
was in the center of the royal capital Ratna kusuma pradīpā. He said to the
cakravartin king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa, ‘Great king, know
this! A tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha has appeared in this world. He is
dwelling in your land, at the bodhimaṇḍa called Samantāvabhāsana dharma-
megha nirghoṣa dhvaja.’1471
37. 79
“When the king’s daughter, Samanta jñānārci padma bhadrābhirāma netra-
śrī candrā, saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s body, light, miracles, and
adornments and heard his voice,
 she experienced a powerful happiness
and delight.
 [F.124.b]
1472
1473
37. 80
“At that time, she thought, ‘May I, through whatever roots of merit I
accumulate, attain a body like that! May I have that kind of jewelry, those
kinds of characteristics, that kind of conduct, and those kinds of miraculous
powers! Just as he has brought a great light for beings in the darkness of
night and told them of the birth of a buddha, so may I dispel the darkness of
ignorance in beings and bring them the light of great wisdom! Wherever I
am reborn, may I never in all those lives be separated from this
kalyāṇamitra!’
37. 81
“Then, noble one, the cakravartin king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī-
cūḍa, with the four divisions of his army,
 with his seven jewels, with his
retinue of women, and with his ministers and the people of his land, through
the king’s miraculous powers, through the great might of the king, rose up
into the sky above the royal capital Ratna kusuma pradīpā to a height of one
yojana. He filled the whole of Jambudvīpa and the entire four-continent
world with a great light. In order to encourage all beings to come and see the
1474


---

Buddha, he manifested his image on all the precious mountains and became
present before all beings in the four-continent world realm and sang a song
of verses that praised seeing the Buddha:
37. 82
“ ‘Into the world has come a buddha
Who will be a savior for all who have bodies.
Everyone should rise and set forth
In order to see that lord of the world! {20}
37. 83
“ ‘The appearance of a tathāgata,
Someone who teaches the Dharma
In order to benefit all who have bodies,
May occur only once in a billion
 kalpas. {21}
1475
37. 84
“ ‘He developed compassion on seeing
The world having gone astray,
Obscured by the darkness of ignorance [F.125.a]
And experiencing the suffering of saṃsāra. {22}
37. 85
“ ‘In order to ripen beings
So as to extinguish all suffering,
He practiced enlightened conduct
For countless millions of kalpas. {23}
37. 86
“ ‘For limitless, endless kalpas,
For the sake of the supreme enlightenment of buddhahood,
He gave away his legs and his arms,
And he also gave away his eyes, ears, and head. {24}
37. 87
“ ‘To see him, honor him,
And hear him will be beneficial.
It is rare even in ten million kalpas
For a lord of the world to appear in the world. {25}
37. 88
“ ‘He is dwelling at the seat of enlightenment.
He is there like a supreme secret.
He has subjugated Māra and his armies
And attained the supreme enlightenment of buddhahood. {26}
37. 89
“ ‘There is an infinite aura of light
That radiates from the Buddha’s body.
Come see its various colors
That bring satisfaction to beings. {27}
37. 90
“ ‘There are countless clouds of light rays


---

That come from the Buddha’s body.
Those beings upon whom they shine
Attain an unparalleled happiness. {28}
37. 91
“ ‘Develop great diligence.
And each according to your wishes,
Make offerings to that protector.
Come! And go into his presence!’ {29}
37. 92
“After King Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa had thus encouraged all
the beings in his realm with those verses, the cakravartin’s roots of merit
created a rain of a million clouds of various offerings that descended onto
the 
bodhimaṇḍa 
Samantāvabhāsana dharma megha nirghoṣa dhvaja.
Clouds of precious parasols covered the entire sky. Clouds of canopies of all
flowers were spread above. Clouds of all kinds of food covered and adorned
the sky. Clouds of nets of bells of various jewels adorned the expanse of the
sky. [F.125.b] The adornment of clouds of light rays of perfume that had been
perfumed by an ocean of various perfumes was present
 throughout the
expanse of the sky. The adornment of clouds of thrones made of all jewels
with seats that were precious cushions was present throughout the expanse
of the sky. The adornment of clouds of upright banners, made of all jewels,
was present throughout the expanse of the sky. The all-covering adornment
of clouds of mansions and aerial palaces was present throughout the sky.
The all-covering adornment of clouds of various flowers was present
throughout the sky. The adornment of rain from clouds of every display of
offerings was present throughout the sky.
1476
1477
37. 93
“The king approached the location of the Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci-
śrī guṇa ketu rāja. Having arrived, he bowed his head to the feet of the
Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja. Then with the Bhagavat to
his right, he circumambulated him many hundreds of thousands of times. He
then sat before the Bhagavat upon a seat that had as its center a great lotus
of precious jewels that shined light into the ten directions.
37. 94
“Then the cakravartin’s daughter, Padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā,
removed the jewelry from her body and scattered it over the Bhagavat
Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja.
37. 95
“She saw that the jewelry became a great parasol of jewelry made of
precious jewels that was situated in the air above the crown of the
Bhagavat’s head. Around its border hung a net of various jewels, it was held
by a lord of the nāgas, its round form was composed of all the jewelry, and it
was surrounded by a circle of ten parasols made of jewelry. [F.126.a] There
was also a beautiful display of a completely pure variety of kūṭāgāras. There
was a covering of clouds of every jewel adornment. There was a covering of


---

an array of trees made of all king jewels. There was the adornment of all the
king jewels of an ocean of perfume. In their center there was a great Bodhi
tree called Dharma dhātu prabhava sarva ratna maṇi śākhā pralamba. This was a
display with no end or center to its description, a variety of displays that
were revealed with each instant.
37. 96
“She saw at the foot of that tree the tathāgata named Vairocana.
“She saw bodhisattvas as numerous as the atoms in countless buddha
realms, who had all arisen through the completely good bodhisattva conduct
and prayer and practiced many countless various different bodhisattva
displays surrounding him and in front of him.
37. 97
“She also saw all the lords of the world present there.
“She saw the Bhagavat Vairocana’s buddha miracles that were without
end or center.
37. 98
“She comprehended his past bodhisattva conduct through a succession of
kalpas. She comprehended that world realm’s kalpas of formation and
destruction. She comprehended the succession of past buddhas in that world
realm.
“She saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra diligently making offerings at
the feet of all the tathāgatas. She saw his ripening and guiding of all beings.
37. 99
“She saw all bodhisattvas becoming images within the body of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, [F.126.b] and that she herself followed them
there.
“She saw the image of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra appearing
everywhere —at the feet of all the tathāgatas, in the dwelling places of all
beings, and in every one of the world realms.
37. 100
“She saw that in each of those world realms there were as many worlds as
there are atoms in a buddha realm, with the extent of their arrays and with
their foundations, their shapes, their forms, their various pure arrays, their
being covered by clouds of various displays, their various names and
numbers, the descriptions of their various buddha lineages and their various
appearances within the three times, their pervasion throughout the extent of
the directions, their various presences throughout the extent of the realm of
phenomena, their appearance within the various areas of the realm of
phenomena, their various locations within areas in space, their displays of
various bodhimaṇḍas,
 the arising of the various miracles of the
tathāgatas, the display of the various lion thrones of the buddhas, the
various oceans of the assemblies of followers of the tathāgatas, the various
activities of the followers of the tathāgatas, the revelation of the skillful
methods of the tathāgatas, the various ways of the turning of the Dharma
1478

wheels of the tathāgatas, the arising of the various aspects of speech and the
sound of the voices of the tathāgatas, the teaching through an ocean of
various languages, and the roar of clouds of various sūtras.
37. 101
“When she saw that, she attained a powerful happiness and delight.
[F.127.a] After she had given rise to powerful happiness, that tathāgata, the
Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja, taught the sūtra called The
Resounding of the Dharma Wheels of All the Tathāgatas and as many
accompanying sūtras as there are atoms in ten buddha realms. When she
heard that sūtra, she attained the bliss of reaching ten thousand subtle
gateways to samādhi. This was like the day
 a consciousness enters the
mother’s womb, to give an analogy. This was like the completed karma of
beings. This was like a day
 in which a seed or seedling that is the cause
of an excellent sal
 tree
 is planted.
1479
1480
1481
1482
1483
1484
37. 102
“She attained these gentle and pleasant samādhis: the samādhi called
directly perceiving all tathāgatas, the samādhi called the radiance that goes through
the entire extent of all the realms, the samādhi called entry into comprehending all
the ways of the three times, the samādhi called the resounding of the Dharma wheels
of all the tathāgatas, the samādhi called perceiving the ocean of prayers by all the
buddhas, the samādhi called the perception of the resounding of the roaring that
saves beings afflicted by the suffering of saṃsāra, the samādhi called the array of
prayers to dispel the darkness of all beings, the samādhi called the perception of the
prayers for all beings to be free from suffering, the samādhi called the origin of the
attainment of happiness by all beings, the samādhi called the essence of never
wearying in ripening and guiding all beings, [F.127.b] the samādhi called the
banner of entering the path of all bodhisattvas, the samādhi of the display of reaching
all the bhūmis of the bodhisattvas, and the other ten thousand gateways to
samādhi.
37. 103
“She had a mind that rested in subtle equanimity, a mind that was
unwavering, a mind that was filled with joy, a mind that was relieved, a mind
that was immeasurable, a mind that followed the kalyāṇamitras, a mind that
was focused on profound omniscience, a mind that had entered an ocean of
the ways of kindness, a mind that had risen above all attachments, a mind
that did not dwell within the scope of the world, a mind that had entered the
scope of the tathāgatas, a mind that was illuminated by the forms and colors
of all the buddhas, a mind that was undisturbed, a mind that was
immovable,
 a mind that was without anger,
 a mind that was without
instability,
 a mind that was without weariness, a mind that was without
regression, a mind that was without dejection,
 a mind that understood
the nature of all phenomena, a mind that had the understanding of the
analysis of all phenomena, a mind that comprehended the ocean of all
beings, a mind that wished to save all beings, a mind that gave rise to the

illumination of the ocean of multitudes of buddhas, a mind that
comprehended the ocean of prayers of all the tathāgatas, a mind that
shattered the mountain of all obscurations, [F.128.a] a mind that
accomplished a vast accumulation of merit, a mind that was directed toward
attaining
 the ten strengths of the tathāgatas, a mind that had attained the
illumination of the range of all bodhisattvas, a mind that increased the
accumulations of all bodhisattvas, and a mind that pervaded throughout all
directions.
1489
37. 104
“With an ocean of prayers as numerous as the atoms in ten buddha
realms, she made the past prayers of all tathāgatas, so that she could
acquire
 completely good great prayers and purify her own buddha realm.
1490
37. 105
“They included prayers to ripen and guide all realms of beings, to know
the entire extent of the realm of phenomena, to comprehend the ocean of the
ways of the realm of phenomena, to practice bodhisattva conduct in all
buddha realms throughout future kalpas, to remain in the domain of
bodhisattva conduct throughout all future kalpas, to go into the presence of
all tathāgatas, to please all kalyāṇamitras, to perfectly make offerings to and
be an attendant for all tathāgatas, to attain omniscient wisdom in every
instant, and to have continuous bodhisattva conduct in order to attain
buddhahood.
37. 106
“Through accomplishing an ocean of gateways to prayers, as numerous as
the atoms in ten buddha realms, she was making the prayer for completely
good bodhisattva conduct.
37. 107
“In order for her to accomplish the completely good bodhisattva conduct
and prayer, the Bhagavat [F.128.b] Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja
encouraged her and inspired her with past roots of virtue that he taught,
revealed, explained, displayed, made stable so they would not be lost,
increased so that they would spread greatly, and caused to remain so that
there would be dedication to omniscience.
37. 108
“This concerned the first development of her aspiration to enlightenment
and her acquiring an ocean of the countless prayers of past tathāgatas.
37. 109
“Noble one, in a past time, ten kalpas before that, the daughter Samanta-
jñānārci padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā was following the teaching of
the Tathāgata Candra dhvaja śrī ketu in a world realm called Maṇi sūrya-
candra vidyotita prabhā. The bodhisattva Samanta bhadra instigated her to
repair a broken statue of the Tathāgata seated upon a lotus. When she had
repaired it, she painted it. When she had painted it, she adorned it with
jewels. Through following the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra she developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.


---

37. 110
“As a result of that root of merit, she became a Dharma follower free of
downfalls. She was always born into a family of lords of devas or a family of
lords of humans. In all her lives she had a body that was attractive and lovely
to look at and had an excellent, beautiful color. She always saw tathāgatas
[F.129.a] and was never separated from the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. That
bodhisattva ripened her in every lifetime and made her remember. She
always honored the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra and was always devoted to
him.
37. 111
“Noble one, who do you think was the cakravartin king Vairocana ratna-
padma garbha śrī cūḍa at that time, in that time? Do not think that it was
anyone else. It was the bodhisattva Maitreya who was Vairocana ratna-
padma garbha śrī cūḍa at that time, in that time.
37. 112
“Noble one, who do you think was the king’s queen, Saṃpūrṇa śrīvakrā, at
that time, in that time? Do not think that it was anyone else. It was this night
goddess, Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī, who is before me.
37. 113
“Noble one, who do you think was the king’s daughter, Samanta jñānārci-
padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā, at that time, in that time? Do not think
that it was anyone else. I was at that time, in that time, the king’s daughter,
Samanta jñānārci padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā. When I was a young
girl in the time of the teaching of the Tathāgata Candra dhvaja śrī ketu and
repaired the statue of the Tathāgata seated upon a lotus, that was the cause
for my highest, complete enlightenment. At that time, the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra inspired me toward the highest, complete enlightenment,
and that was my first development of that aspiration. [F.129.b]
37. 114
“I went into the presence of the Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa-
ketu rāja and scattered my jewelry over him and then saw the Tathāgata’s
miraculous manifestations. Then when I heard the Dharma from that
bhagavat, I attained this bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that
guide beings that appear in all worlds.
37. 115
“I have honored tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru. I have
honored them by all the activities of offering them necessary articles and
attending upon them. I have heard all the Dharma that those tathāgatas have
taught, and I have followed the instructions and teachings of those
tathāgatas. I have greatly venerated those tathāgatas so that through that
veneration I have seen in an instant of mind all tathāgatas, their assemblies
of bodhisattvas, and all their buddha realms.
37. 116
“The world realm Vairocana tejaḥśrī
 passed away, and the kalpa called
Virajomaṇḍala came to an end. They were followed by the world realm called
Maṇi cakra vicitra pratimaṇḍita vyūhā and the kalpa called Mahāprabha, in
which appeared five hundred buddhas, and I honored all of them. The very
1491


---

first of them in the Mahāprabha kalpa was the tathāgata whose name was
Mahā karuṇa megha dhvaja. When he set forth into homelessness, I was a
night goddess who made offerings to him.
37. 117
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Vajra nārāyaṇa ketu. I
was a cakravartin who made offerings to him. [F.130.a] That tathāgata taught
me the sūtra called The Birth and Arising of All Buddhas, together with
accompanying sūtras as numerous as the atoms in ten buddha realms. I
heard it and retained it.
37. 118
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Jvalanārciḥ parvata-
śrī vyūha. I was a head merchant’s daughter and made offerings to him. That
tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The Essence of the Light of the Three Times,
together with accompanying sūtras as numerous as the atoms in
Jambudvīpa. I heard it and retained it.
37. 119
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Sarva dharma-
samudrābhyudgata vega rāja. I was a king of devas and made offerings to
him. That tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The Categories of the Knowledge of
All the Bases of the Realm of Phenomena, together with five hundred
accompanying sūtras. I heard it and retained it.
37. 120
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Gambhīra dharma śrī-
samudra prabha. I was the daughter of a lord of the nāgas and made an
offering to him of the rain from a cloud of kings of precious wish-fulfilling
jewels. That tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The Power of an Increasing
Ocean of Delight, together with a million accompanying sūtras. I heard it and
retained it.
37. 121
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Ratna śikharārciḥ-
parvata pradīpa. I was an ocean goddess who approached him and made an
offering of the rain from a cloud of precious lotuses. [F.130.b] That tathāgata
taught me the sūtra called Ways of the Ocean of Phenomena, together with
accompanying sūtras as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm. I heard it
and retained it, memorized it, and kept it.
37. 122
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Guṇa-
samudrāvabhāsa maṇḍala śrī. I was a ṛṣi with the five higher cognitions who
was encircled by sixty thousand ṛṣis and manifested great miracles. I
approached him and made an offering of the rain from a mountain-sized
cloud of perfumed lotuses. That tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The
Lamp of Phenomena Being without Location, together with ten thousand
accompanying sūtras. I heard it and retained it.
37. 123
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Vairocana śrī garbha.
I was an earth goddess named Samatārtha saṃbhavā. Together with a
countless retinue of earth goddesses, I approached him to make an offering
of the rain falling from a cloud of precious flowers and a cloud of strings of


---

jewels that had arisen from the trunks of trees made of all jewels. That
tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The Essence of the Source of the Wisdom
That Is the Origin of All the Tathāgatas, together with countless accompanying
sūtras. I heard it, retained it, and did not lose it.
1492
37. 124
“Noble one, the last of all those five hundred tathāgatas was the tathāgata
Dharma dhātu gagana pūrṇa ratna śikhara śrī pradīpa who appeared in the
world. At that time, I was the daughter of a dancer [F.131.a] and had the
name Abhirāma śrīvakrā. The tathāgata came to the city, and when the
dancers were playing music, through the power of the Buddha I rose up into
the air and praised the tathāgata with a thousand verses. Then I went to him.
From the tathāgata’s ūrṇā hair shined a ray of light called the display of the
radiance of the realm of the Dharma, which illuminated my entire body. The
instant that light touched my body, I obtained the liberation called the
concentrated essence of the way of the realm of Dharma.
37. 125
“Noble one, in that way I pleased and made offerings to all those
tathāgatas, the five hundred buddhas that appeared in the world realm
called 
Maṇi cakra vicitra pratimaṇḍita vyūhā 
during 
the 
kalpa 
called
Mahāprabha. Those tathāgatas taught me the Dharma, and I remembered it
all. I did not forget a single letter or a single word of those ways of the
Dharma.
37. 126
“When I went before each of those tathāgatas, I recited the Buddha’s
Dharma, and in that way I benefited countless beings.
37. 127
“From each of those tathāgatas I obtained an ocean of the contents of the
realm of the Dharma, an illumination from the lightning of omniscience,
[F.131.b] which was called The Extensive Realm of the Dharma That Is the Essence
of the Knowledge of the Three Times, and I followed and continued all the
completely good conduct.
37. 128
“In that way, noble one, in each instant of mind there appear tathāgatas
without outer limit or center. When I see those tathāgatas, there is the
illumination of the lightning of omniscience, and that which I had not
previously attained, which I had not previously seen, becomes present
within the continuum of my mind, without ever deviating from the
completely good conduct of the bodhisattva.
37. 129
“Why is that? This attainment of the illumination from the lightning of
omniscience is a teaching that has no outer limit or center.”
37. 130
At that time, the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, in order to teach
further and classify the bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that
guide beings that appear in all worlds, through the blessing of the Buddha recited
these verses to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
37. 131
“The profound view is difficult; it is difficult to comprehend
The different ways of the extents of the three times


---

And the completely shining domain of Dharma light.
Listen to these words of mine, Sudhana. {30}
37. 132
“Listen to me as I reveal the way,
Wishing for the qualities of buddhahood,
I first developed the aspiration for enlightenment
And how it was I attained this liberation. {31}
37. 133
“In the past, beyond kalpa after kalpa,
As many as there are atoms in a buddha realm,
There was a vast, stainless, faultless world realm
Called Vairocana dhvaja pradīpa śrī. {32}
37. 134
“There had arisen the kalpa Virajomaṇḍala,
In which there was a succession of buddhas.
At that time those with the faultless ten strengths
Appeared as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru. {33}
37. 135
“The first of those sugatas was
Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja,
Then there was the Jina Dharmadhvaja, then Śrīsumeru,
And the fourth jina was Guṇa keśarīśvara. {34}
37. 136
“Then there were the Jina Śānti rāja, Samitāyus,
Yaśaḥparvata, Guṇa sumeru śrī,
The Jina Abhāskara, and the Bhagavat Śaśimukha,
And those were, in that way, the first ten. {35}
37. 137
“Then there were the Jina Gaganālaya, and Samataprabha, [F.132.a]
Diśasaṃbhava, Smṛti samudra mukha,
The Jina Abhyudgata, Sumeruśrī,
And the Sugata Dharmārci parvata śrī, {36}
37. 138
“Then Kāruṇika, and ninth was Padmodgata.1493
The tenth buddha was Dharma dhātu kusuma.
In that way, these were the second ten
From the description of the ocean of buddhas. {37}
37. 139
“Then there were Prabha ketu rāja mati,
 Jñānamati,
1494
Citrārthendra, Śrīdevamati,
Jina Vegarājamati, Jñāna śrī,
And Avabhāsa rāja, and Prabha ketu śrī, {38}
37. 140
“Then the Jina Vikrānta deva gati,
And likewise Dharma dhātu padma.

In that way, those were the third ten
Within the way of this vast teaching. {39}
37. 141
“Then there was the Bhagavat Ratnārci parvata śrī,
And following him were Guṇa samudra śrī,
Dharmaprabha, Padma garbha śrī,
And the Sugata Gati candra netra nayana, {40}
37. 142
“Then Gandhaprabha, Maṇisumeruśrī,
Gandharva kāya prabha rāja, and
Maṇi garbha rāja śri teja vatin,
And the tenth jina was Praśama rūpa gati. {41}
37. 143
“Following them were the Jina Vipulabuddhi,
Ratnaprabha, and Gagana megha śrī.
Then there were the Jina Vara lakṣaṇa śrī,
Vratamaṇḍala, and Svaśarīra prabha, {42}
37. 144
“Then Nārāyaṇa vrata sumeru śrī,
The Jina Guṇa cakravāla śri rāja,
The Bhagavat Aparājita vrata dhvaja,
And Druma parvata, the tenth of those jinas. {43}
37. 145
“Then there were the Jina Sālendra rāja śri garbha,
Lokendra kāya pratibhāsa prabha,
The Bhagavat Abhyudgata prabha śrī,
Vajraprabha,
 and Dharaṇi teja śrī, {44}
1495
37. 146
“Then the Jina Gambhīra dharma guṇa rāja śrī,
Dharma sāgara nirghoṣa mati,
Merudhvajaśri, Prabhāsamati,
And the tenth jina, Ratnarājaśri. {45}
37. 147
“Then there were Brahmaprabha, the Jina Gagana ghoṣa, [F.132.b]
Dharma dhātu pratibhāsa śri,
The Bhagavat Āloka maṇḍala prabha,
And Diśabheda jñāna prabha ketu mati, {46}
37. 148
“Then Gagana pradīpa, Abhirāmaśrī,
The Sugata Vairocana prabha śrī, and
Puṇya prabhāsa śri śānta śrī,
And the tenth was Mahā karuṇa megha śrī. {47}
37. 149
“Then there were Tathatāprabha, Bala prabhāsa mati,
And the Jina Sarva jagadabhi mukha rūpa;

Then there was Abhyudgata,
And after him was Samaśarīra. {48}
37. 150
“In the same way, there was the Sugata Dharmodgata,
And after him came Anilavegaśrī,
Śūradhvaja, and Ratna gātra śrī,
And the tenth was Tryadhva pratibhāsa prabha. {49}
37. 151
“Then there was Praṇidhāna sāgara prabhāsa śrī,
The second was Vajrāśaya giri śrī,
The third jina was Harisumeruśrī,
And then there were Smṛti ketu rāja śri and Dharmamati, {50}
37. 152
“Then Prajñāpradīpa, Prabha ketu śrī,
And after them the Jina Vipulabuddhi,
The Jina Dharma dhātu naya jñāna gati,
And Dharma samudra mati jñāna śri. {51}
37. 153
“Then there were Dharmadhara, Ratnadānaśri,
The Jina Guṇa cakravāla śri megha,
Kṣānti pradīpa śrī, and Tejovat,1496
And the Jina Vega prabha śamatha ghoṣa, {52}

37. 156
“The Bhagavat Diśadeśā mukha jaga,

The Buddha Parārtha savihāra śrī,
And the Jina Prakṛtīśarīra śrī bhadra. {55}
37. 157
“Those jinas and the others appeared there.
When they appeared, they were lamps for the world.
I made offerings to that ocean of jinas
For as many kalpas as there are atoms in Sumeru. {56}
37. 158
“Whatever jinas have appeared in kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm,


---

I have made offerings to all those sugatas
And followed this way of liberation. {57}
37. 159
“I have practiced throughout endless past kalpas,
Meditating on this way of liberation.
Having heard it, practice it quickly,
And you will attain this way before long. {58}
37. 160
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations
that guide beings that appear in all worlds. How could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who remain in the aspiration to an
ocean of bodhisattva conduct that has no outer limit or center, who have
bodies in accordance with the various dispositions of beings, who
accomplish an ocean of various faculties, and who have the realization of the
various kinds of bodhisattva conduct and prayers?
37. 161
“Depart, noble one. Here in the bodhimaṇḍa, there is the goddess of the
night named Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī.
“She is seated on a lotus throne with the adornment of shining banners of
kings of jewels in its center, and with an entourage of countless millions of
night goddesses. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
37. 162
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, circumambulated the night
goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī many hundreds of thousands of times,
keeping her to his right, [F.133.b] and, looking back again and again,
departed from the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī. [B8]
