Chapter 38
PRAŚANTA RUTA SĀGARA VATĪ
38. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, meditating on the night goddess
Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī’s bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that
guide beings that appear in all worlds, and contemplating it, having faith in it,
engaging in it, increasing it, expanding it, augmenting it,
 gaining power
over it, illuminating it, and being absorbed in it, approached the night
goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī.
1497
38. 2
He bowed his head to the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī’s feet,
circumambulated the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī many hundreds
of thousands of times, and then stood before the night goddess Praśanta-
ruta sāgara vatī.
38. 3
With his hands placed together in homage, he said, “Āryā, I have entered
upon the highest, complete enlightenment, and through relying on
kalyāṇamitras I am training in bodhisattva conduct. I have entered into
bodhisattva conduct, and I am practicing bodhisattva conduct. I wish to
bring forth omniscience through being established in bodhisattva conduct.
Therefore, Āryā, goddess, I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas
should train in bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
[F.134.a]
38. 4
The night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī said to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that in this way you
seek bodhisattva conduct by relying on kalyāṇamitras. Noble one, I have
attained the bodhisattva liberation called the display in each instant of mind of
the arising of the power of vast delight.”
38. 5
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what kind of activity do you accomplish? What
kind of range do you have? What is your practice? What do you
contemplate? What is the range of the bodhisattva liberation called the display
in each instant of mind of the arising of the power of vast delight?”

She replied, “Noble one, I have entered the equanimity of the purification
of the ocean of mind and thought. I have attained the aspiration for an

“I gradually ripen them for omniscience in this way: I develop
nonattachment within beings who dwell in mansions and aerial palaces. I
dispel their unhappiness. I bring an end to all attachments. I teach them the

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, said to the night goddess
Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī, “Āryā, goddess, how does a bodhisattva practice in

She answered, “Noble one, there are these ten: a great accumulation, a
great abundance of qualities, a great vastness, a great brightness, a great
illumination, a great brilliance, a great portion,
 a great share, a great
becoming, and the great fortune of the bodhisattvas.
1510
“If bodhisattvas practice them, they will attain a perfect result such as this
liberation.
38. 49
“What are these ten? (1) Engaging in the generosity of a bodhisattva,
which satisfies all beings in accordance with their aspirations, is a vast
quality. (2) Engaging in the practice of the correct conduct of a bodhisattva,
which enters an ocean of the qualities of the tathāgatas, is a vast quality. (3)

Engaging in the patience of a bodhisattva, which realizes the nature of all
phenomena, is a vast quality. (4) Engaging in the diligence of a bodhisattva,
which undertakes attaining omniscience, is an extensive quality. (5)
Engaging in the meditation of a bodhisattva, which pacifies the torment of
the kleśas in all beings, is an extensive quality. (6) Engaging in the wisdom
of a bodhisattva, which is knowing the entire ocean of the Dharma, is an
extensive quality. (7) Engaging in the methods of a bodhisattva, which
guides and ripens the entire ocean of beings, is an extensive quality. (8)
Engaging in the prayer of a bodhisattva, which is entering the entire ocean
of realms in order to perform bodhisattva conduct in all buddha realms
throughout the endless future kalpas, is an extensive quality. [F.141.b] (9)
Engaging in the strength of a bodhisattva, which is to enter an ocean of the
ways of the realm of the Dharma so as to continuously manifest the
attainment of buddhahood in each instant in all buddha realms, is an
extensive quality. (10) Engaging in the knowledge of a bodhisattva, which is
to gain the strengths of the tathāgatas so as to attain the unobscured
knowledge of all phenomena in the three times, is an extensive quality.
38. 50
“Noble one, those ten are the great accumulations, the vast qualities of the
bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas who remain within them will obtain this kind
of bodhisattva liberation. They will make it pure, cause it to arise, increase it,
elevate it, manifest it, accomplish it, make it enduring, make it vast, perfect it,
and establish it.”
38. 51
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, goddess, how long has it been since you set out for
the highest, complete enlightenment?”
38. 52
She replied, “Noble one, to the east of this ocean of world realms called
Kusuma tala garbha vyūhālaṃkāra, beyond a hundred thousand oceans of
world realms, there is an ocean of world realms called Sarva ratna vimala-
prabhā vyūha. In its center there is a group of world realms called Sarva-
tathāgata prabhā praṇidhi nirghoṣa. In its center is a world realm called
Kanaka vimala prabhā vyūha, which has multicolored clouds made of every
jewel; [F.142.a] its base is a firm ocean of a network of garlands of every
jewel; its main body is a display of every perfumed diamond, the king of
jewels; it has the shape of a kūṭāgāra; it is both pure and defiled
 and
covered over with clouds of aerial palaces and dwellings made of divine
materials.
1511
38. 53
“There, during a kalpa called Samantāvabhāsa dhvaja, in that world, there
was a bodhimaṇḍa called Sarva ratna garbha vicitrābha. There a tathāgata,
who was called the Bhagavat Avivartya dharma dhātu nirghoṣa, attained the
highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood.

38. 54
“At that time, in that time, I was a goddess of the bodhimaṇḍa, named
Puṇya pradīpa saṃpatketu prabhā, who dwelled at the Bodhi tree. When I
saw that tathāgata’s miraculous manifestation of buddhahood, I developed
the aspiration to attain the highest, complete enlightenment, and on seeing
that tathāgata I attained a samādhi called the light of an ocean of qualities.
38. 55
“Subsequently, 
the 
Tathāgata 
Dharma druma parvata tejas 
attained
buddhahood at that bodhimaṇḍa, by that world’s royal capital called
Samanta saṃpūrṇa śrī garbhā. I had passed away and become a night
goddess, by the name of Jñāna śrī puṇya prabhā, who dwelled at the
bodhimaṇḍa.
38. 56
“There I saw the Tathāgata Dharma druma parvata tejas’ miraculous
manifestation of turning the wheel of the Dharma, and I attained a samādhi
called the range of the light of an ocean of qualities. [F.142.b]

38. 60
“Subsequently, I venerated the Tathāgata Dharma megha nirghoṣa rāja at
that bodhimaṇḍa. As soon as I saw that tathāgata, I attained a samādhi
called the lamp of the ocean of all dharmas.

bodhimaṇḍa. As soon as I saw that tathāgata, I attained a samādhi called the
light of the lamp that ends the suffering of all beings.

“Subsequently, I venerated the Tathāgata Dharma pradīpa vikrama jñāna-

called the illumination of the conduct and faculties of beings in the three times.
38. 65
“In that way, noble one, in the world realm called Kanaka vimala prabhā-
vyūha, during the kalpa called Samantāvabhāsa dhvaja, I venerated as many
tathāgatas as there are atoms in ten buddha realms. Sometimes I venerated

sometimes, when I was a deva; sometimes, when I was a human; sometimes,
when I was a woman; sometimes, when I was a man; sometimes, when I was
a boy; and sometimes, when I was a girl. To all those tathāgatas I made
offerings and offered whatever I possessed. I attended to all those
tathāgatas. I heard the Dharma that all those tathāgatas taught.
38. 66
“After I passed away, I practiced bodhisattva conduct in that world realm
for as many kalpas as there are atoms in a buddha realm.
38. 67
“Then, when I passed away, I was reborn in this Sahā world realm in the
ocean of world realms called Kusuma tala garbha vyūhālaṃkāra.

“Subsequently, I venerated the Tathāgata Vairocana. At the bodhimaṇḍa,
he manifested in each instant of mind an ocean of the gateways to the
miraculous manifestations of a tathāgata’s buddhahood. As soon as I saw
that, I attained this bodhisattva liberation called the display in each instant of
mind of the arising of the power of vast delight. As soon as I had attained it, I
entered an ocean of the ways of the realm of phenomena that were as
numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms. I saw
that in each of the atoms that were all the atoms within all buddha realms in
that ocean of all the ways of the realm of phenomena, there were buddha
realms as numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha
realms.
38. 72
“I saw that among all those buddha realms, in each buddha realm there
was the Bhagavat Vairocana going to the bodhimaṇḍa and in each instant of
mind manifesting the miraculous manifestation of the attainment of
buddhahood. Each miraculous manifestation of the attainment of
buddhahood completely pervaded the ocean of ways of the realm of
phenomena.

“I perceived that among all those tathāgatas, I was seated at the feet of
every one of those tathāgatas. [F.144.a] I heard all the Dharma that was
taught by all those tathāgatas seated at the bodhimaṇḍa in those world
realms.

“An ocean of emanations came from each pore of all those tathāgatas,
roaring out an ocean of clouds of Dharma, manifesting various miraculous
manifestations, and turning the wheel of the Dharma according to the
various dispositions of beings born into various kinds of existences, the
entire extent of all beings in all the ocean of realms, in all successions of
world realms, in the entire extent of world realms within the ocean of every
direction in the realm of phenomena.

“I possess all those turnings of the Dharma wheel, comprehend them,
understand them, and keep them through the power of mental retention that
has the prowess of maintaining all their meaning, words, and letters. I purify
them with wisdom that understands the essence of the pure domain of all
the Dharmas. I understand their categories through skill in the analysis of
the ocean of all Dharmas. I permeate them with an understanding that is as
vast as the three times. I perceive them as equal through the wisdom that
comprehends the equality of the tathāgatas. I accomplish all the ways of the
Dharma. I attain clouds of sūtras within all the Dharmas.
 I am established
in an ocean of Dharma within the clouds of all sūtras. I am established in the
categories of Dharma in the ocean of all Dharmas. I know clouds of Dharma
within the categories of all Dharmas. [F.144.b] I give rise to waves of Dharma

“You ask me how long it has been since I attained this bodhisattva
liberation called the display in each instant of mind of the arising of the power of vast
delight? [F.146.a] It was like this: As many kalpas ago as there are atoms in
two buddha realms, in the world realm called Kanaka vimala prabhā, I was a
Bodhi-tree goddess by the name of Puṇya pradīpa saṃpatsamanta ketu-
prabhā. When I heard the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata Avivartya-
dharma dhātu nirghoṣa, I developed that aspiration to attain the highest,
complete enlightenment. I practiced bodhisattva conduct for as many kalpas
as there are atoms in two buddha realms and was then reborn in this world
realm called Sahā. I venerated the tathāgatas of the Bhadra kalpa, from
Krakucchanda to Śākyamuni, and I will also venerate its future buddhas.
And just as in this world realm, I will venerate and make offerings to the
future succession of buddhas in all world realms.
38. 78
“Noble one, there continues even now to be a succession of buddhas in
the world realm Kanaka vimala prabhā.
“Therefore, noble one, you should dedicate yourself to this way with the
fortitude of the bodhisattva.”
38. 79
At that time, the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī, in order to teach
further the bodhisattva liberation called the display in each instant of mind of the
arising of the power of vast delight, recited these verses to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son:
38. 80
“Listen, Sudhana, to these words of mine
About how I obtained this good liberation.
Hearing them will give rise to great delight,
And you must comprehend this liberation. {1}
38. 81
“I purified my mind and my thoughts,
And I developed a vast, powerful aspiration. [F.146.b]
Intent on the city of omniscient wisdom,
I practiced for many oceans of past kalpas. {2}
38. 82
“I listened to the sugatas in the three times
And developed an aspiration toward them all.
Through the passage of many hundreds of kalpas,
I attended on them and their assemblies. {3}
38. 83
“I saw the sugatas of the past and made offerings to them


---

Over a long time, so as to bring benefit to beings.
Having developed a powerful enthusiasm,
I listened to their Dharma without weariness.
 {4}
1526
38. 84
“On following the way of this liberation,
I continually and respectfully attended
Those who were my father, mother, and guru,
Venerating them and bringing them happiness and benefit. {5}
38. 85
“Through hundreds of lifetimes and with a loving mind,
I was a wealthy protector who brought happiness
To many people who were old, who were sick, and who were poor,
Who had impaired faculties, were in suffering, and had no protector. {6}
38. 86
“During my bodhisattva conduct in past lives,
I saved beings from an ocean of various dangers
Caused by kings, fire, and bandits1527
And by lions, elephants, and enemies. {7}
38. 87
“During my bodhisattva conduct in past lives,
I saved beings afflicted by kleśas in the three realms
From the various terrors of the ocean of existence
That arise through their bad actions. {8}
38. 88
“I protected those classes of beings
Who have fallen into the abyss of saṃsāra,
Terrified by the sufferings of the lower realms,
Which are always overwhelmingly dreadful.
As I practiced bodhisattva conduct in the world,
I ended the terrors of birth, old age, sickness, and death.
 {9}
1528
38. 89
“My prayer is that until the last kalpa
I will bring an end to the suffering of saṃsāra;
I will bring happiness to all beings
And give rise to the ultimate happiness of buddhahood. {10}
38. 90
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the display in each
instant of mind of the arising of the power of vast delight. [F.147.a] How could I
know the conduct or describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who have
comprehend the entire realm of phenomena, who are liberated from every
outer and inner suffering, who know the names of all kalpas, who are wise
in the creation of the ocean of all worlds and their destruction?

38. 91
“Depart, noble one. Here in this very bodhimaṇḍa, within the assembly of
the Bhagavat Vairocana, there is the goddess of the night who has the name
Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a
bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva
practice it?’ ”
38. 92
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, recited these appropriate verses
to the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī:
38. 93
“The kalyāṇamitra instructed me correctly,
And therefore I came into your presence, goddess.
I saw you seated upon your throne
With a body that knows no limit or center. {11}
38. 94
“Those who rely on existence and believe things to be real,
Whose fields of perception are colors, shapes, and characteristics,
Inferior beings who hold wrong views,
Cannot know this field of activity of yours. {12}
38. 95
“The vision of your body is infinite.
The world and its devas could not know
The characteristics of your form and color
Even by examining them for endless kalpas. {13}
38. 96
“Goddess, you are above the basis of the skandhas.
You are not located within the āyatanas.
There is no doubt that you have transcended the world
And manifest miracles within the world. {14}
38. 97
“You are unshakable, without fault, without impediment.
You have purified your eyes of wisdom.
You see in an atom as many buddhas
As there are atoms, performing miracles. {15}
38. 98
“Your body has the essence of the Dharma body. [F.147.b]
Your mind consists of unobstructed wisdom.
You shine with the radiance of all-pervading light,
Illuminating the endless beings in the world. {16}
38. 99
“Endless karma arises from the mind.
All the worlds are paintings by karma.
You know directly the minds of beings,
And the manifestations of your body are as numerous as beings. {17}
38. 100
“You know this world to be like a dream


---

And that all the buddhas are like reflections,
That every single Dharma is like an echo,
And without impediment you act within all worlds. {18}
38. 101
“You manifest your body in each instant
To all the beings dwelling in the three times.
With no duality in your mind,
You teach the Dharma throughout all directions. {19}
38. 102
“The ocean of atoms is without end,
And the ocean of beings is also measureless.
The ocean of the buddhas has no edge or center,
And they are all within the scope of your liberation.” {20}
38. 103
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having praised the night goddess
Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī with these appropriate verses, circumambulated the
night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī. [B9]
