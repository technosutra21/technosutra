Sudhana eventually reached the town of Roruka and approached the
householder Ajitasena, bowed his head to the feet of the householder
Ajitasena, stood before him, [F.278.b] and, with his palms together in
homage, said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it. Ārya, I have
heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that
you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and
how they should practice it!”

When he had said that, the householder Ajitasena said, “Noble one, I have
attained the bodhisattva liberation called unceasing characteristics so that I
have attained the treasure of the unceasing vision of the buddhas.
51. 3
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the village called Dharma,
resides a brahmin by the name of Śivarāgra. Go to him and ask him, ‘How
should a bodhisattva train in and practice bodhisattva conduct?’ ”

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
householder Ajitasena. He circumambulated the householder Ajitasena
many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking
back at him again and again, he departed from the householder Ajitasena.
