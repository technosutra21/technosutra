Chapter 22
ACALĀ
22. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, left the city of Suprabha, and having
followed the road for a little while, he contemplated the instruction given to
him by King Mahāprabha: he remembered the way of bodhisattva conduct
called the banner of great love; he meditated on the light of the great samādhi
called exercising power over the world; he realized
 the variegated display of
the lion throne and adornments of the pure bodhisattva body; he increased
the inconceivable power and strength of bodhisattva aspiration and merit;
[F.36.a] he made firm
 the inconceivable way of bodhisattva wisdom that
ripens beings; he reflected upon the inconceivable greatness of the general
enjoyments of the bodhisattvas; he considered the inconceivable different
aspects
 of the bodhisattvas; he remembered the inconceivable pure
ripening of beings by bodhisattvas; he thought about the inconceivable pure
and perfect bodhisattva assembly of pupils; he had conviction in the
inconceivable radiance of the bodhisattvas’ dedication to their duty to
beings; 
and 
he 
attained 
happiness, 
powerful 
attraction, 
delight,
contentment, deep joy, clarity of mind, brightness of mind, stability of mind,
vastness of mind, and inexhaustibility of mind. He was in that way dedicated
to remembering and thinking of the kalyāṇamitra.
1052
1053
1054
22. 2
With his face covered in tears, he thought “Ah! Oh! Seeing the
kalyāṇamitra is the source of all precious qualities. It perfects and purifies all
bodhisattva conduct. It makes pure all bodhisattva mindfulness. It purifies
all the domains of bodhisattva retention. It gives rise to the radiance of all
bodhisattva samādhis. It accomplishes seeing all buddhas. It brings down
the rain from the Dharma clouds of all
 the buddhas. It indicates the way
of all bodhisattva prayers. It gives rise to the inconceivable light of
knowledge and wisdom. [F.36.b] It grows the sprouts
 of stable
bodhisattva faculties. The kalyāṇamitras save me from falling into the chasm
of the lower existences. The kalyāṇamitras have brought me to the
1055
1056


---

realization of the way of the equality of phenomena. The kalyāṇamitras have
shown me the paths to happiness and to unhappiness. The kalyāṇamitras
have taught me the Mahāyāna. The kalyāṇamitras have given me the
instructions on the completely good bodhisattva conduct. The kalyāṇamitras
have shown me the road to the city of omniscience. The kalyāṇamitras have
guided me on the way to the town of omniscience. The kalyāṇamitras have
made me enter the ocean of the ways of the realm of the Dharma. The
kalyāṇamitras have taught me the ways of an ocean of what is to be known
in the three times. The kalyāṇamitras have shown me all the circles of ārya
assemblies.
 The kalyāṇamitras have increased all my good qualities.”
1057
22. 3
While he thus wept and wailed, the devas who were assembled in the sky,
who were bodhisattva devas, emissaries of the buddhas who continually
followed him and inspired him, called down to him, “Noble one, the
bodhisattvas who follow the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras greatly please
the buddha bhagavats. The bodhisattvas who never go against the words of
the kalyāṇamitras come close to omniscience. The bodhisattvas who do not
doubt the words of the kalyāṇamitras [F.37.a] come close to the
kalyāṇamitras. The bodhisattvas who always have the kalyāṇamitras in their
minds are approaching all their goals.
22. 4
“Noble one, go to the upāsikā Acalā in the royal capital of Sthirā! You will
hear the bodhisattva conduct from her.”
22. 5
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, emerged from samādhi’s light of
wisdom and eventually arrived at Sthirā, where the upāsikā Acalā was.
22. 6
He searched and looked for the upāsikā Acalā, and many people said to
him, “Noble one, the upāsikā Acalā is young and lives with her parents at
home, where, surrounded by her family, she teaches the Dharma to a great
gathering of people.”
22. 7
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, his mind filled with great
happiness, enthusiasm, and joy, went to the home of the upāsikā Acalā. After
arriving there, while he was waiting at the door he saw
 the entire house
shining with a pervading golden light that brought ease to mind and body.
The instant the light touched Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, he entered,
and there arose five hundred subtle and newly developed entrances to
samādhi such as entrances to the samādhi called power over all sensations,
entrances to the samādhi called the region of peace, entrances to the samādhi
called apart from
 all beings, entrances to the samādhi called the all-seeing
equanimity, and entrances to the samādhi called the treasure of the tathāgatas.
[F.37.b] Those samādhis were very subtle and newly developed like a
consciousness that has just entered the womb.
1058

22. 8
Then Sudhana sensed a lovely scent of such a kind that male devas did
not have, that female devas did not have, that male nāgas did not have, that
female nāgas did not have, that male yakṣas did not have, that female yakṣas
did not have, that male gandharvas did not have, that female gandharvas did
not have, that male asuras did not have, that female asuras did not have, that
male garuḍas did not have, that female garuḍas did not have, that male
kinnaras did not have, that female kinnaras did not have, that male
mahoragas did not have, that female mahoragas did not have, that male
humans did not have, and that female humans did not have.
22. 9
There was no equal to that girl’s body in the worlds in the ten directions,
let alone one that was superior.
22. 10
Apart from the luster of the color of the bodies of the tathāgatas, and the
luster of the color of consecrated bodhisattvas, there was no one in the
worlds in the ten directions who had a body with a luster of color that
equaled the luster of color of her body, let alone one that was superior.
22. 11
Apart from the shape and figure of the bodies of the tathāgatas, and the
shape and figure of consecrated bodhisattvas, there was no one in the
worlds in the ten directions who had a body with a shape and figure that
equaled the shape and figure of her body, let alone one that was superior.
22. 12
Apart from the aura of light of the tathāgatas, and the aura of light of
consecrated bodhisattvas, there was no one in the worlds in the ten
directions who had an aura of light that equaled her aura of light, let alone
one that was superior.
22. 13
Apart from the tathāgatas and the consecrated bodhisattvas, there was no
one in the worlds in the ten directions, in the realms of devas, nāgas, yakṣas,
gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, or nonhumans,
who had a scent that equaled the scent of the breath that came from her
mouth, let alone one that was superior.
22. 14
Apart from the displays and enjoyments of the abodes of the tathāgatas,
and the displays and enjoyments of the abodes of the consecrated
bodhisattvas, [F.38.a] there was no one in the worlds in the ten directions
who could equal the displays and enjoyments of her abode, let alone anyone
who could be her superior.
22. 15
Apart from the perfect entourage of attendants of the tathāgatas and the
perfect entourage of attendants of the consecrated bodhisattvas, there was
no one in the worlds in the ten directions who could equal her perfect
entourage of attendants, let alone anyone who could be her superior.
22. 16
There was no being among the classes of beings in the worlds in the ten
directions who could look upon the upāsikā Acalā with desire.
22. 17
There was no being among the classes of beings in the worlds in the ten
directions whose kleśas did not cease as soon as they saw the upāsikā Acalā.


---

22. 18
Just as the Mahābrahmās who have power over a million desire realms
do not have kleśas arising within them, in the same way, the beings who
saw the upāsikā Acalā did not have kleśas arising within them.
1061
22. 19
There was no being among the classes of beings in the worlds in the ten
directions who had enough of looking upon the upāsikā Acalā, apart from
those who had the contentment of wisdom.
22. 20
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw the inconceivable majesty of the
upāsikā Acalā’s body and her inconceivable form, color, shape, and figure;
he saw the inconceivable network of unimpeded light rays from the entirety
of the ground, city, and jewels; and he saw the accomplishment of
inconceivable benefits for beings.
22. 21
He smelled the lovely scent that arose from all her pores, saw the infinite
perfect assembly of her attendants, saw the perfect, unassailable display of
the aerial palace that was her home, perceived the measureless ocean of its
qualities, and praised the upāsikā Acalā with this verse: [F.38.b]
22. 22
“You continually maintain a stainless good conduct.
You are completely pervaded
 by vast patience.
1062
You are established in diligence as firm as a vajra.
You are superior among beings like the shining lord
 of mountains.”
{1}
1063
1064
22. 23
After Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had praised the upāsikā Acalā with
that verse, he said to her, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas
should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I
pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
22. 24
The upāsikā Acalā spoke with a gentle, beautiful, delightful voice to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, with words that brought him joy, saying,
“Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration
for the highest, complete enlightenment.
22. 25
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the essence of
wisdom that is difficult to attain. I train in the gateway of bodhisattva conduct
that possesses a strong commitment. I have attained the gateway of the
power of retention of the level of the equality of all phenomena. I have
attained the gateway called the light of the wisdom of eloquence that elucidates
the basis
 of all phenomena, [F.39.a] and I have attained the gateway of
the samādhi called the display of the tireless search for the Dharma.”
1065


---

22. 26
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is the scope of the bodhisattva liberation
called the essence of the wisdom that is difficult to attain? What is the scope of the
gateway of bodhisattva conduct with a strong commitment, of the gateway
of maintaining the level of the equality of all phenomena, of the gateway of
the light of the wisdom of eloquence that elucidates the basis
 of all
phenomena, and of the gateway of the samādhi called the display of the tireless
search for the Dharma?”
1066
Acalā answered, “Noble one, this is a subject that is difficult to
believe.”1067
22. 27
Sudhana said, “Āryā, please teach me. Through the power of the buddhas
and being in the care of the kalyāṇamitras, I will believe it, comprehend it,
know it, understand it, discern it, cognize it, reflect upon it as a focus of my
attention, contemplate it, not deny it, not conceptualize it, not add to it, and
be in accord with it.”
22. 28
Then the upāsikā Acalā said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble
one, in the past, during a kalpa called Stainless Light, appeared the tathāgata
named Pralambabāhu. At that time I was the only daughter
 of King
Vidyuddatta. One night when I was not sleeping,
 the door of the royal
residence
 was shut, my parents were asleep, the staff of men and women
had gone to sleep, the sound of music being played had ceased, and the five
hundred women that I spent time with were sleeping, I sat on my bed,
looking at the constellations of stars in the sky. In the sky above I saw the
Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Pralambabāhu, who was like Sumeru,
the lord of mountains. He was accompanied by an entourage of many nāgas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas. His body
spread a network of unimpeded light rays throughout all directions. From all
the pores of the tathāgata’s body came a beautiful scent [F.39.b] that brought
ease to my mind and body and great happiness to my mind.
1068
1069
1070
22. 29
“I arose from my bed and stood on the floor, and with my ten fingers
placed together in homage, I bowed down to the Tathāgata Pralambabāhu.
As I looked at the crown of his head there seemed to be no end to it, and I
could not grasp his extent to the right or left. I could never have enough of
contemplating his perfect signs and features of a great being.
22. 30
“At that time, I wondered, ‘Through what kind of karma can one obtain
such a perfect body? Give rise to the perfect signs and features of a great
bring? Have such a perfect display of light? Attain such a perfect entourage?
Have such a perfect residence and requisites that are of the nature of the
mind? Develop such a perfection of merit? Have such purified wisdom?
Attain such perfect, inconceivable miracles from samādhi? Complete such
perfect powers of retention? And have the power of such perfect eloquence?’


---

22. 31
“Noble one, the Bhagavat Tathāgata Pralambabāhu knew my thought and
said, ‘Girl, develop an invincible motivation for the defeat of all the kleśas.
Develop an undefeatable motivation for eliminating all attachment. Develop
an unwearying motivation for comprehending the way of the profound
Dharma. Develop an unshakable motivation for descending into the whirling
ocean of the range
 of the thoughts of beings. Develop an unconfused
motivation for the rebirth in all the states of existence within saṃsāra.
Develop a never-satisfied motivation for the continuous aspiration to see all
the buddhas. [F.40.a] Develop a never-satiated motivation in order to obtain
the clouds of Dharma of all the buddhas. Develop a realized motivation in
order to realize the light of the way of the Dharma of all the buddhas.
Develop an acquisitive motivation for acquiring the Dharma wheels of all the
buddhas. Develop a motivation to be without delusion concerning even a
small gesture, let alone to know that which comes from a tathāgata’s mouth.
Girl, you should develop the motivation to distribute the precious Dharma in
accordance with the aspirations of beings.’
1071
22. 32
“Noble one, I heard from the Bhagavat Tathāgata Arhat Samyak-
saṃbuddha Pralambabāhu, that king of the gateways of instruction to the
way of the Dharma, and I longed to attain omniscient wisdom. I aspired to
the nature of the strengths. I wished for the words of the Buddha. I wanted
to have the purified display of light of a buddha. I wanted to attain the
perfect body of a buddha. I longed to have a buddha’s pure signs and
features of a great being. I aspired to have the perfect assembly of followers
of a buddha. I wished for
 the pure realms of a buddha. I longed for the
perfect conduct of a buddha. I rejoiced in the perfect lifespan of a buddha. I
had developed the motivation that could not be impaired by all the kleśas or
by the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, which like a vajra could not be
defeated even by the strength of all mountains and weapons.
1072
22. 33
“Noble one, from that time until now, through the power of having
developed that motivation, throughout as many kalpas as there are atoms in
Jambudvīpa, [F.40.b] I do not remember
 ever in my mind enjoying
pleasures, let alone copulation.
1073
22. 34
“Noble one, from that time until now, I have never had one thought of
anger toward a kalyāṇamitra, let alone offended any other being.
22. 35
“Noble one, from that time until now, I do not remember having ever
given rise to a single thought that holds the view that there is a self, let alone
having attachment to things that I think of as being mine.
22. 36
“Even when I died and was reborn inside a womb, I do not remember
being in a state of stupidity, having various concepts, or having a neutral
state of mind, let alone having a state of mental fixation.


---

22. 37
“Throughout those kalpas I do not remember ever forgetting
 seeing a
buddha, even down to the perception of the sight of a buddha in a dream, let
alone the perception of the visual images of the ten levels of bodhisattvas.
1074
22. 38
“From that time until now, while holding the clouds of Dharma of all the
tathāgatas, I do not remember forgetting
 in my mind even a single word
or term of the Dharma, even down to a single syllable, let alone what has
emerged from the treasure of the mouths of the tathāgatas.
1075
22. 39
“From that time until now, while I drank and drank from the ocean of the
Dharma, I do not remember ever ignoring and not contemplating even any
words of the worldly Dharmas.
22. 40
“From that time until now, I do not remember not accomplishing the
samādhi of a single gateway to the ways of the Dharma from among the
ocean of the ways of the Dharma, even down to the ways of the knowledge
of worldly crafts.
22. 41
“From that time until now, while I held the wheels of Dharma of the
tathāgatas in order to guide beings, I do not remember leaving out a single
word or even a single syllable that was transmitted to me.
22. 42
“From that time until now, there is not a single prayer from the ocean of
the visions of buddhas that I have not accomplished in order to purify the
ocean of beings, even down to carrying out the prayer of a buddha who was
an emanation. [F.41.a]
22. 43
“From that time until now, I do not remember not practicing any
bodhisattva conduct from the ocean of the past bodhisattva conduct of the
ocean of buddhas in order to purify my conduct.
22. 44
“From that time until now, I do not remember creating a single motivation
that was focused on being a śrāvaka or a pratyeka buddha.
22. 45
“Noble one, from that time until now, throughout as many kalpas as there
are atoms in Jambudvīpa, I do not remember ever having given rise to
doubts, dualistic identification, conceptualized identification, variegated
identification, obdurate
 identification, identification as inferior,
 or
identification as appropriate or inappropriate concerning any single word or
syllable.
1076
1077
22. 46
“Noble one, since that time, I have never been separated from the
appearance of a buddha. I have never been separated from the buddha
bhagavats. I have never been separated from the bodhisattvas. I have never
been separated from the true kalyāṇamitras. I have never been separated
from hearing the prayers of the buddhas. I have never been separated from
hearing of the conduct of the bodhisattvas. I have never been separated from
hearing the way of the perfections of the bodhisattvas. I have never been
separated from hearing the way of the light of the wisdom of the level of the
bodhisattvas. I have never been separated from the attainment of hearing the


---

inexhaustible treasures and treasuries of the retentions and samādhis of the
bodhisattvas. I have never been separated from hearing of the
comprehension of and entry into the centerless and endless network of
world realms. I have never been separated from the attainment of hearing
the causes for the arising of the centerless and endless [F.41.b] realms of
beings. I have never been separated from the light of the wisdom of the
cessation of the domain of the network of the kleśas of all beings. I have
never been separated from the attainment of the wisdom of the causes that
give rise to the roots of merit of all beings. I have never been separated from
the manifestation of bodies in accordance with the aspirations of all beings. I
have never been separated from the pure domain of the speech that brings
knowledge to all beings.
22. 47
“Noble one, I have accomplished this gateway of the bodhisattva
liberation called the essence of the wisdom that is difficult to attain and the
gateway of the samādhi called the display of the tireless search for the Dharma; I
have reflected on the gateway to bodhisattva conduct with a firm
commitment; I have contemplated the gateway called the power of retention of
the level of the equality of all phenomena and the gateway called the light of the
wisdom of eloquence that elucidates the basis of all phenomena; and therefore
miraculous powers have arisen. Noble one, do you wish to see them?”
Sudhana answered, “I wish to do so.”
22. 48
The upāsikā Acalā viewed, analyzed, followed, and realized gateways of
bodhisattva liberations such as the essence of wisdom that is difficult to attain and
many millions of gateways of samādhis: gateways of samādhis such as the
display of the tireless search for the Dharma, samādhis such as the display of the
unfailing domain, samādhis such as facing the display of the domain of the wisdom
of the ten strengths, and samādhis such as the inexhaustible treasure of the buddha
family.
22. 49
As soon as the upāsikā Acalā rested in those samādhis, Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, saw world realms as numerous as the atoms in ten
anabhilāpya buddha realms in the ten directions shake in six ways, [F.42.a]
and he saw that they were formed of pure beryl. He saw in each world realm
a billion tathāgatas in a billion four-continent world realms. He saw some
dwelling in Tuṣita and so on, up to some passing away into nirvāṇa. He saw
that because those completely pure world realms of beryl were unobscured,
each of those tathāgatas pervaded the entire realm of phenomena with their
light rays and halos; each of those tathāgatas had their own ocean of
separate assemblies of followers; and each of those tathāgatas taught the
wheel of the entire Dharma, which was heard by all beings, who listened to
the domains of their speech.


---

22. 50
Then the upāsikā Acalā rose from that samādhi and said to Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, “Noble one, did you see that? Did you hear that? Did
you discern that?”
He answered “I saw it. I heard it. I discerned it.”
22. 51
The upāsikā Acalā said, “Noble one, I have trained in the gateway of the
bodhisattva conduct called possessing a strong commitment; I have rested in the
samādhi called the display of the tireless search for the Dharma; I have dwelled in
the gateway of bodhisattva liberations called the essence of the wisdom that is
difficult to attain; I have realized the power of retention of the level of the equality of
all phenomena; and through being skilled in describing the light of the wisdom of
eloquence that elucidates the basis of all phenomena, I have taught beings and
brought them satisfaction.
22. 52
“However, how could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who possess measureless, inconceivable qualities; whose
activity has no fixed location, like the lord of birds in the sky; who, like the
great lord of the garuḍas, [F.42.b] dive into the ocean of beings in order to
extract the ripened bodhisattvas; who, like merchants, go the island of the
jewels of omniscience, longing for the jewel that is the wisdom of the ten
strengths; who, like strong fishermen, go onto the ocean of saṃsāra
 with
the beautiful net of the domain of the wheel of the Dharma in their hands in
order to draw ripened beings out from the water of craving; who, like the
lord of the devas,
 move throughout the three realms, filling them in order
to repel and subjugate the attacks of the asuras of the kleśas; who, like the
disk of the sun, rise high in the sky of the realm of the Dharma in order to dry
the water of the craving of beings and the mud of the kleśas; who, like the
full moon, shine in the sky of wisdom in order to cause the night lotuses of
the minds of those to be guided to blossom; who, like the surface of the
Earth, support all equally without any distinction between those who are
friends and not friends, or those who are high and those who are low, in
order to cause the sprouts of the power of goodness in all beings to rise and
grow; who, like a tempest, move everywhere without impediment in order to
uproot the trees, vines, forests, and groves of the kleśas and false views of all
beings; who, like a cakravartin, act within the world in order to gather all
beings through conditions and requisites as methods of gathering pupils?
1078
1079
22. 53
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in a land called Amitatosala,
there is a town named Tosala. There dwells the parivrājaka by the name of
Sarvagamin. Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
22. 54
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
upāsikā Acalā, [F.43.a] circumambulated the upāsikā Acalā a hundred
thousand times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again,


---

departed from the presence of the upāsikā Acalā.
