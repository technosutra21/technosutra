Chapter 54
MAITREYA
54. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, his mind moistened by the instructions of
the kalyāṇamitra, contemplated bodhisattva conduct. Thinking of how his
many bodies in the past had failed to practice perfect conduct, he made
resolute the strength of his body. Thinking of how his body and mind
throughout the past, even though pure, were the worthless continuation of a
saṃsāric mind, he applied the attention of his mind to conduct. Thinking
how his actions throughout the past had been impure, had been devoted to
the world, and were worthless hardships, he contemplated accomplishing in
the present that which is very meaningful. [F.289.a] Thinking how
throughout the past he had developed thoughts through incorrect
examination, he generated the strength to create the correct examination of
bodhisattva conduct. Thinking how his past bodies had a range of
activity
 dedicated to engaging in self-benefit, he made firm the strength
of his superior, higher motivation to engage in benefiting
 all beings.
Thinking how in the past he had the flavorless conduct of continually
seeking what was desired, he increased the great force of the power for
attaining relief through engaging in obtaining the Dharma of the buddhas.
Thinking how in the past he had engaged in conduct through an incorrect
motivation, he purified
 the flow of his mind in the present with a correct
view that was free of error and with dedication to bodhisattva prayer.
Thinking how in the past he fruitlessly had no diligence in his undertakings
and practiced without diligence, in the present he motivated his mind and
body by generating the diligence for remaining prepared to gather the
Dharmas of the buddhas. Examining how he and others had been lost in the
lower realms and
 the five classes of beings, and thinking how in the past
he had not taken care of his body, he increased a vast, powerful rejoicing

and aspiration for maintaining a body with the power to accomplish all the
Dharmas of the buddhas, take care of all beings, and serve all kalyāṇamitras.
[F.289.b]
54. 2
He looked upon the body he had attained at that present time as the basis
for illness, death, and misery, as a treasure that comes together and comes
apart, and as the cause and condition for dedication to the practice of
bodhisattva conduct until the last future kalpa; for dedication to ripening
beings and possessing
 the Dharma of the buddhas; for dedication to
seeing the tathāgatas, going to all realms, venerating all dharmabhāṇakas,
and acquiring the teachings of all the tathāgatas; for help in the search for all
Dharmas; for dedication to seeing all kalyāṇamitras and gathering all the
Dharma of the buddhas; and for bodhisattva prayers and a body of
wisdom.
 Thus he increased the inconceivable power and force of his
roots of merit.

54. 3
With such a motivation, such thoughts, and such fundamental dedication,
with the faith that is created by the belief of all bodhisattvas, with the regard
that is created by the aspirations of all bodhisattvas, with the respect that is
created by the higher motivation of all bodhisattvas, with the reverence that
is created by the power of the belief of all bodhisattvas, with the strength of
the power of belief that is created by the aspiration to buddhas
 by all
bodhisattvas, with the mind’s belief that comes forth from the veneration of
all bodhisattvas, with the accumulation of roots of merit that arise from the
faith of all bodhisattvas, [F.290.a] with the different kinds of offerings that are
created from all the activities of all the bodhisattvas, with the body having
the hands placed together in homage in the same way as that of all
bodhisattvas, looking with the different kinds of vision of the bodies of all
beings, with the equality of the Dharma of all who are designated as
bodhisattvas for all who are designated as beings, with countless designated
bodies bowing and paying homage that come from the miraculous
manifestations through the prayers of all bodhisattvas,
 with the
accomplishment of the display of recited praises that come from the aspects
of the voices of all bodhisattvas, filled with the blessing of all the
bodhisattvas in the past and present,
 with the direct perception of the
residence of the tathāgatas, with the all-pervading enlightenment
miraculously manifested by the tathāgatas and bodhisattvas, following the
bodies of all bodhisattvas pervading nothing greater than a single hair, with
the perception illuminated by the higher cognition that conceives of the pure
path of vision of all bodhisattvas, with the mental āyatana that follows all the
different networks of the directions, with the strength that accomplishes the
prayer that pervades all the different surfaces in the realm of phenomena,
with the gateways for entering all the Dharma pervading everywhere to the

ends of the realm of space, continuously and with no difference in the three
times, with the strength of entering faith and aspiration, and with the
illumination of the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras spreading into the
directions reaching the shore of the ocean of realms, [F.290.b] Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, in that way, with a mind following such a perception
of respect, veneration, offering, praise, homage, the blessing of seeing, and
prayer, with the eyes of wisdom that comprehended such a level of the
immeasurable field of activity of wisdom, prostrated himself at the door of
the great kūṭāgāra called Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha.
54. 4
In that way, for a moment he examined that kind of accomplishment and,
through the power of accomplishment through the higher motivation and
prayer that arise from aspiration and faith, was empowered to continuously
be at the feet of all the tathāgatas.
54. 5
In the same way, he was empowered to be directly before all bodhisattvas,
before the locations of all kalyāṇamitras, before all the caityas of the
tathāgatas, before all the statues of the tathāgatas, before all the palaces of
the buddhas and bodhisattvas, before all the locations of the precious
Dharma, and before the locations and caityas of all śrāvakas and pratyeka-
buddhas. He was continuously and directly present in all the gatherings of
beings up to the gatherings of the āryas, in the places of offering, and before
gurus and parents, through the way of undifferentiated wisdom bodies
going everywhere with empowered perception and empowered by the
mental activity of wisdom.
54. 6
Just as there were those perceptions at the door of the great Vairocana-
vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra, which have just been described, he was
empowered in the same way to bow down and pay homage throughout the
entire realm of phenomena. He was thus empowered continuously,
throughout the future, by sameness with the extent of the measureless realm
of space, [F.291.a] by sameness with the realm of phenomena without
obscuration, by sameness with reaching the limits of existences, by
sameness with the nonconceptual true nature,
 by sameness with the
pervasion of shadow-like knowledge and perceptions, by sameness with
dream-like analysis, by sameness with reflection-like perception of all worlds
and beings, by sameness with echo-like origination from causes and
conditions, by sameness with birthlessness, by sameness with origination
and destruction,
 and by sameness with causes and conditions that have
the same nature as nonexistence, so that he was aspiring to ripening that
occurs in accordance with karma; aspiring to results that occur in accordance
with causes; aspiring to all activities that arise in accordance with
accumulations; aspiring to the arising of all tathāgatas, which occurs in
accordance with faith; aspiring to the emanation of offerings to all buddhas,

which occurs in accordance with aspiration; aspiring to the miraculous
manifestations of all tathāgatas, which occur according to veneration;
aspiring to the nature of all the buddhas, which occurs in accordance with
the accumulation of roots of merit; aspiring to the accomplishment of
displays, which occurs in accordance with method and wisdom; aspiring to
the Dharmas of all buddhas, which occur according to prayer; aspiring to all
bodhisattva conduct and its all-pervasive display of the accomplishment of
the entire realm of phenomena as the field of perception of omniscience,
which occur according to prayers of dedication,
 and with the wisdom of
prayers of dedication, which is free from the conception of nothingness;
with the wisdom of birthlessness, which is free from the conception of
eternality;
 [F.291.b] with the wisdom of entry into correct conduct and the
accumulation of causes, which is free from false views concerning causes
and actions;
 with the nonerroneous
 wisdom that is free from
erroneous views; with the wisdom of nondependence, which is free from the
view of independence; with the wisdom that understands dependence,
which is free from the view of the concept of self and other; with the wisdom
that enters the realm of phenomena that has no center or edge, which is free
from the view that fixates on extremes; with the wisdom that accomplishes
similarity to reflections,
 which is free from the view of the transference of
skandhas; with the wisdom of there being neither creation nor cessation,
which is free from the view of birth and destruction;
 with the wisdom of
the birthlessness of
 emptiness, which is free of all views; with the
strength of the wisdom that accomplishes prayers,
 which has the
realization of the nature of phenomena as being devoid of independent
existence; with the wisdom that has the gateway to the apex of the absence
of characteristics, which is devoid of all characteristics; through the
indestructible nature of phenomena that seedlings come from sprouts;
through the nature of phenomena that a seal’s image is produced by a seal;
through the nature of phenomena that a reflection comes from a visible form;
through the nature of phenomena that an echo is perceived as being the
same as a sound; through the nature of phenomena that analysis is
perceived to be the same as a dream;
 through the nature of phenomena
that the production of actions is the same as conjured illusions; through the
nature of phenomena that the world is produced by the formless mind;
through the nature of phenomena that results arise in accordance with the
conditions and causes that have been accumulated; through the nature of
phenomena that the ripening of results occurs in accordance with the karma
that has been accumulated; through the nature of phenomena of
manifestations through skill in methods; through the nature of phenomena
of being moistened by the sameness of that which is Dharma and that which

is not Dharma; and through the perception and mentation of the attainment
of such an entry into wisdom, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed
down and paid homage at the door of the great Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra-
garbha kūṭāgāra. [F.292.a]
54. 7
Then, for a long time, with his mind saturated by the inconceivable force of
his roots of merit, with well-being of body and mind, he stood at the gateway
of the kūṭāgāra and for a little while gazed unblinking at the Vairocana-
vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra. Then with palms together in homage, he
circumambulated it many hundreds of thousands of times.
54. 8
Then, with his mind inspired by that kind of perception and mentation, he
said these words: “This is the dwelling of those who are present within the
dwelling of emptiness, the absence of characteristics, and the absence of
aspiration; of those who are present within the dwelling of the indivisibility
of the realm of the Dharma; of those who are present within the dwelling of
the imperceptibility of the realm of beings; of those who are present within
the dwelling of the birthlessness of all phenomena; of those who are present
within the dwelling of the locationlessness of all worlds; of those who are
present within the dwelling of the baselessness of all beings; of those who
are present within the dwelling of meditation on all locations; of those who
are present within the dwelling of nondependence on any source of
dependence; of those who are present within the dwelling of nonreliance on
any body; of those who are present within the dwelling of the elimination of
all conceptions;

absence in all phenomena of a nature of their own; of those who are present
within the dwelling of not conceiving any illusory thoughts, ideas, or
concepts; of those who are present within the dwelling of the absence of
conception, mind, and mentation; of those who are present within the
dwelling of neither adopting nor rejecting any path; of those who are
present within the dwelling of entering the profound perfection of wisdom;
of those who are present within the dwelling of the method for pervading
the realm of the Dharma through every gateway; [F.292.b] of those who are
present within the dwelling of the pacification of all kleśas; of those who are
present within the dwelling of the greatest wisdom that eliminates all false
view, craving,
 and pride; and of those who are present within the
dwelling of delighting in the arising of all dhyānas, liberations, samādhis,
samāpattis, higher cognitions, and knowledges; and this is the dwelling of
those who are present within the dwelling of meditation on the field of
activity of the samādhis of all bodhisattvas.

“This is the dwelling of those who are present in the location of entering
all kalpas within one kalpa and one kalpa within all kalpas; of those who are

one realm or between one realm and all realms; of those who are present in

Dharma in all Dharmas; of those who are present in the location where there

have transcended all worldly locations, appear in the locations of all beings
in order to ripen all beings; of those who, though they do not dwell in any
realm, are present in all realms in order to make offerings to all the
tathāgatas; of those are present in all buddha realms in order to perceive the
displays of all buddha realms without moving from their locations; of those
who though they are present at the feet of all tathāgatas are free from
attachment to the concept of buddhas; of those who are present in all the
locations where there is reliance on all kalyāṇamitras but there is no wisdom

pleasures; of those who, though they are present in the locations of entry

realms, do not roam through the realm of phenomena as differentiated

“This is the dwelling of those who dwell in the location of entering such a
difficult direction of the Dharma.

“This is the dwelling of those who dwell in profound locations, who dwell
in nondual locations, [F.293.b] who dwell in locations without characteristics,

elaborations, who dwell in locations of great love and great compassion,

enter, who dwell in locations that transcend the scope of all māras, who
dwell in locations that are unstained by the scope of all worlds, who dwell in
the locations of the perfections of the bodhisattvas, and who dwell in the
locations that correspond to the locations of all the buddhas.

“They who dwell in the location free of all characteristics do not enter the
faultlessness of the śrāvakas. They who dwell in the location of the
birthlessness of all phenomena do not fall into the nature of birthlessness.

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, recited these verses:

“This is the dwelling of those who have peace and serenity,

“This is the dwelling of those who are skilled in wisdom and method,
Who are wise in their perception of the liberations,

54. 22
“This is the dwelling of those who are dedicated to peace,

“This is the dwelling of those with great

“This is where enter the sons of the sugatas, endowed with memory,

“Dwelling here, with higher cognition, method, and wisdom,

“Dwelling here, they manifest all their Dharma activity
From the first development of motivation to the conclusion of the good
Dharma.

“This is the dwelling of those who have attained what is difficult,
Who with one aspect of the mind can enter realization,

“This is the dwelling of those with unimpeded understanding,
Who are active throughout the unobscured realm of phenomena,

“This is the dwelling of those unequaled ones
Whose activity is without impediment,
Without a location, dwelling in all realms,

Who, seeing beings tormented by suffering,
Are dedicated to aspiring to benefit the world

“From here they clearly illuminate without impediment,
As do the disks of the sun and the moon, [F.297.a]
All the abodes of beings, so that nothing remains unilluminated,
And they free the beings from all the nooses of the māras. {35}

“Those sons of the jinas, while dwelling here,
Are also at the feet of all the jinas.
They appear in all the realms
Throughout all endless kalpas. {36}

“From here all the jinas pervade
All directions without exception
With clouds of emanated bodies
As numerous as those of the bodies of beings. {37}

“Those heroes, while dwelling here,
Evaluate the fields of activity of all jinas.
Though they have this conduct for millions of kalpas,
There will never be a time when they have had enough. {38}

“They realize here countless millions
Of samādhis in each instant.
Through entering samādhis in that way,

looking in the direction of the bodhisattva Maitreya, bowed down,
prostrating with his entire body to the bodhisattva Maitreya in the distance.

“Whoever delights
 in this conduct
2037
In all these results that are aspired to,
And similarly in its diligence and motivation,
Should practice Sudhana’s conduct. {153}
54. 171
“All conduct originates from prayer.
All Dharma originates from aspiration.
Sudhana, this has been accomplished by you.
Always pursue this supreme conduct! {154}
54. 172
“To the extent that the nāgas have the intention,
To that extent there will come rainfall.
To the extent that there is the field of activity of the wisdom of prayers,
To that extent spreads the conduct of a bodhisattva. {155}
54. 173
“Sudhana, this conduct that is called good,
This is the way that has been taught to you.
Knowing it, you will naturally be serving
The kalyāṇamitras; at that time, have no fear.
 {156}
2038
54. 174
“Contemplate how in the past you have wasted
Millions of lives meaninglessly for the sake of desires.
Now, in seeking for enlightenment,
Proceed perfectly disciplined by disciplined conduct. {157} [F.304.a]
54. 175
“While ten million kalpas passed by,
You experienced all composite suffering.
You did not honor buddhas as numerous as the Ganges sands
Or hear from them the teaching on this way. {158}
54. 176
“Now this time you have been born into an opportune human existence,
Have seen the appearance of a buddha, and have heard
This supreme bodhisattva conduct from these kinds of kalyāṇamitras,
So why should your mind not be pure? {159}
54. 177
“The sugatas can appear repeatedly
And the Dharma heard from the kalyāṇamitras,
But if your aspiration has not been purified,

It will be difficult to hear this way. {160}
54. 178
“Therefore, develop faith, aspiration, and motivation,
And with veneration for the gurus
Be weary of and reject views of doubt,
And listen again and again to this way. {161}
54. 179
“Those who have heard this kind of entry into conduct
And have accomplished that kind of prayer
Will have an inconceivable, perfect attainment
And will have an excellent human existence. {162}
54. 180
“For the ones who purify that kind of aspiration,
The sight of all the sugatas will not be rare.
All jinaputras will be their kin, and henceforward
He will have no doubts about enlightenment. {163}
54. 181
“Those who enter this kind of way
Will forsake all downfalls through error,
Will eliminate all the phenomena of suffering,
And will accumulate all good qualities. {164}
54. 182
“When the body is abandoned, one will soon
Go to a completely pure buddha realm;
One will enter the dwellings of the bodhisattvas
And will see the tathāgatas of the ten directions. {165}
54. 183
“Sudhana, through your multitude of causes in the past,
Through your definite aspiration in the present,
And through your relying on kalyāṇamitras for a special purpose,
You will grow like a blue lotus on the water. {166}
54. 184
“You who have the aspiration to revere all kalyāṇamitras,
You who have the aspiration to please all buddhas, [F.304.b]
You who have the aspiration to inquire about all Dharmas,
You who have excellent discipline, stand up easefully. {167}
54. 185
“Stand, you who are established in all practices of the Dharma,
You who are established in following all paths,
You who are established in the prayers of the sons of buddhas,
You who are a vessel for all good qualities and the Dharma. {168}
54. 186
“Just as you have developed a perfect aspiration
And you have paid homage to me,
Before long you will come to be

Directly before the assemblies of all buddhas. {169}
54. 187
“Well done, Sudhana, you who have an untiring mind,
Who have the motivation of the prayers of all the buddhas;
You who have firm discipline, you will before long
Perfectly accomplish the qualities of all buddhas. {170}
54. 188
“Sudhana, go into the presence of Mañjuśrī,
Who has fully attained the field of activity of wisdom,
And ask him about the supreme, excellent good conduct,
And then you will enter that way and practice it.” {171}
54. 189
In that way, Maitreya, who has an unimpeded field of activity,
Saw Sudhana, who was superior through his excellent qualities.
He then showed him to his entire assembly of followers
And described this excellent treasury of his qualities. {172}2039
54. 190
When Sudhana had heard such instructions
And such a sublime teaching as this,
His senses were saturated by the power of joy,
And he streamed with a flow of many tears. {173}
54. 191
There arose a great experience of joy,
His senses were satisfied, and he was spontaneously relieved.
Sudhana stood up with his palms pressed together,
And he performed circumambulations around Maitreya. {174}
54. 192
Through the power of Mañjuśrī there appeared
A precious garland of flowers in Sudhana’s hands,
And there appeared many kinds of delights,
Which were arising from bodhisattva prayers. {175}
54. 193
At that time, Sudhana was filled with joy,
And he joyfully scattered them toward Maitreya.
At that time, Maitreya stroked his head, [F.305.a]
And then he recited this verse: {176}
54. 194
“Well done, well done, Jinaputra Sudhana.
In that manner you remain unwearied.
You will quickly become a vessel for qualities
So that you will be just like me and Mañjuśrī.” {177}
54. 195
When he heard that, Sudhana, filled with joy, recited,
“My meeting this kind of kalyāṇamitra
Would be a rare event even in hundreds of lives!


---

It is excellent that I have come here today! {178}
54. 196
“Through your excellent blessing, Mañjuśrī,2040
You who have attained the perfection of all qualities,
I have found these rare kalyāṇamitras.
May I soon be together with you!” {179} [B19]
54. 197
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, stood before the bodhisattva
mahāsattva Maitreya with his palms together in homage and said, “Ārya, I
have set out upon the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know
how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
should practice it.
54. 198
“Ārya Maitreya, you have been prophesied by all the tathāgatas to be only
one lifetime from the highest, complete enlightenment.
54. 199
“Those who are only one lifetime from the highest, complete
enlightenment have transcended all the established states of bodhisattvas.
They have entered the faultlessness of bodhisattvas. They have completed
all the perfections. They have entered all the gateways to patience. They
have attained all the bodhisattva bhūmis. They delight in all the entrances to
the bodhisattva liberations. They have accomplished all samādhis. [F.305.b]
They have realized all the states of existence of bodhisattvas. They have
attained all the ways of the light of retention and eloquence. They have
gained all the powers of bodhisattvas. They have gathered all the
accumulations of bodhisattvas. They delight in the ways of skill in wisdom
and methods. They have developed the ways of the light of great higher
cognition, knowledge, and wisdom. They have come forth from all trainings.
They have purified all bodhisattva conduct. They have accomplished all the
gateways that arise from prayer. They have obtained the prophecies of all
tathāgatas. They are skilled in the gateways that arise from all yānas. They
have obtained the blessing of all the tathāgatas. They have grasped the
enlightenment of all the buddhas. They have gained the Dharma treasure of
all the tathāgatas. They possess the treasure of the secrets of all the
tathāgatas. They are the heads of all the secret fields of all bodhisattvas. They
are heroes who alarm all the hosts of the kleśas. They are the guides for
those lost in the wilderness of saṃsāra. They are physicians for those
afflicted by the illness of the kleśas. They are supreme among all beings.
They are lords of all lords of the world.
 They are the most senior among
all ārya individuals. They are the chief of all śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas.
They are the sea captains for those who are in the ocean of saṃsāra. [F.306.a]
They wash others with the great ocean of methods of guiding beings.
They see the faculties of ripened beings. They are dedicated to gathering
all beings. They are dedicated to protecting all bodhisattvas. They are

dedicated to remaining within the activities of bodhisattvas. They are
present at the feet of all the tathāgatas. They are superior among all the
assemblies of followers. Their image appears within the abodes of all beings.
They are unstained by any worldly quality. They have transcended the
scope of all māras. They follow the scope of all the buddhas. They attain
without obscuration the scope of all bodhisattvas. They are dedicated to
making offerings to all the tathāgatas. They unite into one way all the

They dwell in the great kingdom of the Dharma. They are consecrated for the
scope of the wisdom of omniscience. They are from all the Dharmas of the
buddhas. They have fully accomplished power over omniscient wisdom.
54. 200
“Ārya, I pray that you teach me how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct, how they should practice it, how practicing
bodhisattvas should attain all the Dharmas of the buddhas; serve the realms
of beings by taking care of them; correctly reach the conclusion of the
commitments that have been made; accomplish the great bodhisattva
conduct that has been undertaken; [F.306.b] bring relief to worlds and their
devas; not deceive
 themselves, beings,
 the Buddha, the Dharma, and
the Saṅgha; not be separated from the family lineage of the buddhas; not
make empty the family of the bodhisattvas; and become holders of all the
ways of the tathāgatas.”
2044
2045
54. 201
The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya looked at all his assembly of
followers and, indicating Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, said, “Noble
ones, regard how this head merchant’s son has asked me about the
accomplishment of bodhisattva conduct and qualities. Patient ones, this
head merchant’s son, with this kind of diligent undertaking, with this kind
of dedication to a goal, with this kind of aspiring commitment, with this kind
of firm motivation, with this kind of unflagging diligence, with this kind of
unceasing appetite for the Buddha’s Dharma, with this kind of quest for
what is superior, with this kind of conduct as if his hair were on fire, with
this kind of longing to see kalyāṇamitras, with this kind of unwearying
service to the kalyāṇamitras, has sought out all kalyāṇamitras, questioned
them, and honored them. Sent by Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, starting from the
city of Dhanyākara, he has roamed throughout the southern region, asked
questions of a hundred and ten kalyāṇamitras, and finally come before me,
throughout that time proceeding with a superior motivation free of any kind
of weariness.
54. 202
“Noble ones, it is very rare to hear the name, see the body, accompany the
field of activity, or have a conduct equal to that of someone who is, in this
way, established in the Mahāyāna, who has maintained a great commitment,
who has a mind that is disciplined by a great aspiration, who wears the

armor of great compassion, who has the intention to protect all beings with
great love, who is dedicated to the perfection of diligence, [F.307.a] who is
dedicated to protecting the multitude of fellow traveling beings, who is
engaged in freeing beings from the great ocean of saṃsāra, who is a follower
of the great path to omniscience, who is dedicated to making available the
great ship of the Dharma, who is determined to accumulate great Dharma
and precious merit, and who is dedicated to gathering the accumulation of a
great gift of the Dharma.
54. 203
“Why is that? Noble ones, it is because this excellent individual has risen
up in order to protect all beings. He has appeared in order to free all beings
from suffering; in order to eliminate all lower existences; in order to dispel all
inopportune paths; in order that all frightening paths be forsaken; in order to
dispel all the darkness of ignorance; in order that all the wildernesses of
saṃsāra be left behind; in order to repel all the cycles of the existences of
beings; in order to transcend the scope of all māras; in order that all bases of
dependency be risen above; in order that there will be no basis in any of the
classes of existence; in order that beings will be extracted from the swamp of
desire; in order that they forsake desire for pleasures; in order that they cut
through the bondage of views; in order that they eliminate attachment to the
false view of destructible aggregations; in order that they cut through the
noose of conceptualization; in order that they turn away from incorrect
paths; in order to bring down the banner of pride; in order to extract the
splinters of habits; in order to destroy the door of obscurations; [F.307.b] in
order to disintegrate the mountain of obscurations; in order to extract beings
from the net of craving; in order to separate beings from the conduct of
ignorance; in order to bring beings across the great river of existences; in
order for beings to forsake deception and deceit; in order to purify minds of
pollution; in order to eliminate doubt, uncertainty, and hesitation; in order to
bring beings across the great river of ignorance; and in order that beings be
revolted by the faults of saṃsāra.
54. 204
“Noble ones, this excellent individual wishes to provide beings with the
ship of the Dharma in order to take them across the four great rivers. He
wishes to bring those who are sinking in the swamp of wrong views onto
the raised ground of the Dharma. He wishes to bring the light of wisdom to
those enveloped in the darkness of ignorance. He wishes to show the path
of the āryas to those wandering in the wilderness of saṃsāra. He wishes to
give the medicine of the Dharma to those tormented by the great illness of
the kleśas. He wishes to provide the realm of deathlessness to those
oppressed by birth, aging, and death. He wishes to extinguish the three
blazing fires with the water of śamatha. He wishes to bring great relief to
those who are distressed by misery, wailing, unhappiness, and tribulation.

He wishes to give the weapon
 of wisdom to those imprisoned in the
wheel of existences.
 He wishes to give the weapon of wisdom to those
beings in the bondage of wrong views. He wishes to show the gateway to
liberation to those imprisoned in the city of the three realms. He wishes to
reveal the safe direction to those who are going in the direction of danger.
He wishes to bring great relief to those being attacked by the bandits of the
kleśas. He wishes to take by the hand those who are frightened and terrified
by the abyss of the lower realms. He wishes to show the city of nirvāṇa to
those who have been seized by the murderers who are the skandhas.
[F.308.a] He wishes to show escape through the path of the āryas to those
encircled by the serpent of the dhātus. He wishes to bring the illumination of
the light of wisdom to those dwelling in deserted villages. He wishes to
bring those at bad fording places to the correct fording places. He wishes to
show genuine kalyāṇamitras to those who have fallen into the hands of
those who are not kalyāṇamitras. He wishes to bring to the Dharma of the
āryas those who aspire to the field of conduct of foolish Dharma. He wishes
to raise upward those who delight in the house of saṃsāra and bring them
into the palace of omniscience.

“Noble ones, in that way, this excellent individual, with that kind of
intention to save beings, continuously seeks to purify the development of
the aspiration for enlightenment. He never wearies in accomplishing the
Mahāyāna. He is never satisfied in drinking from all the clouds of the
Dharma. He is continuously dedicated to completing all accumulations. He is
dedicated to never abandoning purifying all the gateways of the Dharma. He
never abandons his dedication to performing bodhisattva conduct. He has
unswerving application to accomplishing all prayers. He never has enough
of seeing all kalyāṇamitras. He is never fatigued in serving all kalyāṇamitras.
He correctly holds the teaching of the instructions of all the kalyāṇamitras.
54. 206
“Noble ones, a being in the world of beings who has that kind of prayer
for the highest, complete enlightenment is a rare being. [F.308.b] Therefore,
someone who, in setting out for the highest, complete enlightenment,
accumulates the Dharma of the buddhas with this kind of diligent
undertaking; who seeks the path of the bodhisattvas with this kind of
intense aspiration; who purifies bodhisattva conduct with this kind of
dedication; who serves the kalyāṇamitras through this kind of hardship;
who with this kind of conduct, which is undertaken as if his hair were on
fire, never disobeys the kalyāṇamitras; who practices the instructions of the
kalyāṇamitras by practicing with this kind of firm, superior motivation; who
accomplishes the aspects of enlightenment with this kind of successful
acquisition; who with this kind of disinterest in gain, honor, and fame never
contradicts the nature of bodhisattva aspiration; who with this kind of
2048

renunciation, without attachment to home, possessions, desired delights,
happiness, parents, friends, or anything, seeks the company of bodhisattvas;
and who with this kind of lack of concern for his own body and life aspires
to omniscience —such a being is extremely rare.
54. 207
“Noble ones, no other bodhisattva has appeared in a hundred thousand
quintillion kalpas who has attained and realized the perfection of
bodhisattva conduct and prayer, or has come close to the enlightenment of
buddhahood, or has purified a buddha realm, or has ripened and guided
beings, or has entered the knowledge of the realm of phenomena, [F.309.a] or
has accomplished the perfections, or has spread the net of conduct, or has
perfectly accomplished prayers, or has transcended the activities of the
māras, or has served the kalyāṇamitras, or has accomplished and purified all
bodhisattva conduct, or has perfected the strength of accomplishing
completely good bodhisattva conduct in the way that he has attained and
realized them in this one lifetime.”
54. 208
Then, because of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya having described
the qualities and excellences of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, a
hundred thousand beings, having strengthened their aspiration to the
aspects of enlightenment, said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble
one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment in order to bring benefit and happiness to
all worlds, in order to save all the realms of beings, and in order to attain all
the Dharma of the buddhas.
54. 209
“Noble one, it is because you have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment that you have perfectly attained what is to
be attained, you have the perfect attainment of a human life, you live
perfectly in the world of the living, you have pleased the appearance of a
buddha, you have perfectly seen the kalyāṇamitra Mañjuśrī, the continuum
of your mind is an excellent vessel, you are saturated with roots of merit, you
rely perfectly upon good qualities, you have perfectly purified your vast
aspiration and your virtuous motivation, [F.309.b] you are perfectly regarded
by all the buddhas, and, noble one, you have been perfectly accepted by the
kalyāṇamitras.
54. 210
“Why is that? Noble one, the aspiration to enlightenment is like the seed

enemy. In the same way, the bodhisattva who is supported by the hero that
is the development of the aspiration to omniscience has no fear of the enemy
that is bad conduct.
54. 284
“Noble one, Śakra, the lord of the devas, wielding the weapon of the vajra,
defeats the entire host of asuras. In the same way, the bodhisattva who
wields the vajra weapon of the higher motivation that is dependent on the
development of the aspiration to omniscience defeats the entire host of the
asuras who are māras and adversaries.
54. 285
“Noble one, a person who drinks the elixir of life will have a very long life,
will not become weak, and will not grow old. [F.321.a] In the same way, the
bodhisattva who drinks the accumulated life-elixir of the development of the
aspiration to omniscience will continue in saṃsāra for countless kalpas
without ever wearying or becoming stained by the defects of saṃsāra.
54. 286
“Noble one, in all preparations of herbal medicines, one first needs water,
and then they will not turn bad. In the same way, in practicing an
accumulation of all bodhisattva conduct and prayer, one first needs to have
the development of the aspiration to omniscience, and then they will not
turn bad.
54. 287
“Noble one, in all accomplishment of human goals, there must first be the
faculty of life. In the same way, the bodhisattva must first have the aspiration
to enlightenment in order to acquire all the Dharmas of the buddhas.
54. 288
“Noble one, a person who is deprived of the faculty of life has no power to
perform any action and cannot be brought to life even by parents and a host
of relatives. In the same way, bodhisattvas who are separate from the
development of the aspiration to omniscience will have no power to attain
the wisdom of the buddhas, and all beings cannot bring them to life with the
qualities of omniscience.

54. 289
“Noble one, the great ocean cannot be poisoned by any poisons. In the
same way, the great ocean of the development of the aspiration to
omniscience cannot be poisoned by any of the poisons of karma, kleśas, or
the aspirations to enlightenment of the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas.
54. 290
“Noble one, the light of all the stars cannot overwhelm the disk of the sun.
[F.321.b] In the same way, the sun disk of the development of aspiration to
omniscience cannot be overwhelmed by the immaculate qualities of all
śrāvaka and pratyeka buddha stars.
54. 291
“Noble one, not long after a prince has been born, he outshines the
highest ministers who are his seniors through being of noble birth and
sovereignty. In the same way, not long after bodhisattvas have developed
the aspiration for enlightenment, through being born in the family of the
Dharma kings, the tathāgatas, even though they are beginners, through the
sovereignty of the great compassion of the aspiration to enlightenment, they
outshine all the śrāvakas who are their seniors in having practiced celibacy
for a long time.
54. 292
“Noble one, all ministers have to pay homage to a prince, however young
he is and however senior to him they are, and yet the prince does not
disrespect the senior ministers. In the same way, however senior the
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas may be, however long they have been
practicing celibacy, they should bow down to a beginner bodhisattva. Also,
the bodhisattvas should not disrespect the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas.
54. 293
“Noble one, even though a prince is not needed by anyone,
 because he
has the royal title and because of the nobility of his family, none of the king’s
ministers is his equal. In the same way, even though beginner bodhisattvas
are oppressed by result-causing karma and kleśas, they have the title of
having developed the aspiration to omniscience and have the nobility and
greatness of the family of the buddhas, and therefore none of the śrāvakas
and pratyeka buddhas that have reached complete attainment are their
equals. [F.322.a]
2113
54. 294
“Noble one, a completely pure, precious jewel will appear impure to
someone who has the visual defect of cataracts. In the same way, the nature
of the jewel of the development of the aspiration to omniscience is pure, but
it appears impure to those whose eyes of faith have the defect of the
cataracts of ignorance.
54. 295
“Noble one, when all mantras and elixirs have been gathered together and
prepared, they heal the illness of beings through being touched or seen, or
through being in their presence. In the same way, the body of the prayer and
wisdom of the aspiration to enlightenment is created from all the mantras
and elixirs of the accumulation of roots of merit and of wisdom and method.


---

Hearing, seeing, being in the presence of, or thinking of someone who
possesses that aspiration to enlightenment heals the illness of the kleśas of
beings.
54. 296
“Noble one, clothing that has the characteristic of duck feathers
 is
unstained by the defect of mud. In the same way, the aspiration to
enlightenment that is the clothing that has the characteristic of duck feathers
is not afflicted by the defect of the mud of the kleśas of saṃsāra.
2114
54. 297
“Noble one, a wooden figure that has its head shaft will not fall apart but
be able to perform all functions. In the same way, if in the head of the body of
the wisdom of the prayer
 for omniscience there is the shaft of the prayer
for the development of the aspiration to enlightenment, it will have the
power for all bodhisattva activities, and because the body is created from the
wisdom of the prayer for omniscience, it will not fall apart.
2115
54. 298
“Noble one, a machine that does not have a shaft, even though it
possesses wooden limbs, will not have the power for necessary actions.
[F.322.b] In the same way, if bodhisattvas do not possess the higher
motivation of the aspiration to omniscience, even though they have the
accumulation of the limbs of enlightenment, they will not have the power to
accomplish the Dharma of the buddhas.
54. 299
“Noble one, a cakravartin has the precious black agarwood called essence of
the elephant. As soon as that incense is lit, all four branches of the
cakravartin’s army rise up into the sky. In the same way, all the bodhisattva’s
roots of merit, which are the agarwood incense of the development of the
aspiration to omniscience, rise above all the three realms and fully
accomplish the noncomposite field of activity that is the sky of the wisdom of
the tathāgatas.
54. 300
“Noble one, diamonds do not come from inferior jewel mines but from
diamond mines or from gold mines. In the same way, the development of the
aspiration to omniscience is like a diamond. It does not arise in the jewel
mines of the lesser roots of merit of the aspirations of beings, but from the
diamond mines of the great compassion that protects beings or from the
great gold mines of the higher focus on the omniscient wisdom.
54. 301
“Noble one, the class of trees called without a root ultimately has no visible
roots, and yet the trees are seen to be covered like a net with branches,
leaves, foliage, and flowers. In the same way, there are ultimately no visible
roots of merit of the development of the aspiration to omniscience, and yet in
all existences in all worlds there appear the extensive flowers of its merit,
wisdom, and higher cognitions, as a net of great prayers. [F.323.a]
54. 302
“Noble one, if a diamond is placed in a poor container, it does not appear
to be beautiful, and a vessel with cracks or holes cannot contain it, only a
vessel in perfect condition. In the same way, the great diamond of the


---

development of the aspiration to omniscience will not have beauty in the
vessels of beings who have weak aspiration, are miserly, have bad conduct,
are malevolent, are lazy, have disrupted mindfulness, or have wrong
understanding. It cannot be contained within beings who are vessels with
unstable minds and who follow erroneous higher motivations, but only in
the precious vessels of a bodhisattva’s higher motivation.
54. 303
“Noble one, a diamond can pierce all other jewels. In the same way, the
diamond of the development of the aspiration to omniscience can pierce and
comprehend all the precious Dharmas of the buddhas.
54. 304
“Noble one, a diamond can cut through and overcome all stones. In the
same way, the diamond of the development of the aspiration to omniscience
can cut through and overcome the stone of false views.
54. 305
“Noble one, even if a diamond is broken, it is superior to all other jewels
and outshines ornaments of gold. In the same way, even if the diamond
jewel of the development of the aspiration to omniscience becomes broken
through one’s following erroneous thoughts, it still outshines the golden
adornments that are the qualities of all śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas.
54. 306
“Noble one, even if a diamond is broken, it will dispel all poverty. In the
same way, even if the diamond jewel of the development of the aspiration to
omniscience becomes broken through not being practiced, it can still dispel
the poverty that is saṃsāra. [F.323.b]
54. 307
“Noble one, however small a diamond element may be, it still has the
characteristic of being able to cut all jewels and stones. In the same way,
however minor the engagement in the diamond element of the development
of the aspiration to omniscience, it still has the characteristic of destroying all
ignorance.
54. 308
“Noble one, a diamond jewel does not come into the hands of lesser
people. In the same way, the diamond jewel of the development of the
aspiration to omniscience does not come into the hands of devas and
humans who have inferior aspiration and poor roots of merit.
54. 309
“Noble one, a person who is not skilled in examining jewels will not know
the qualities of a diamond jewel and therefore will not experience its
qualities. In the same way, a person whose understanding is confused is not
skilled in the qualities of the great diamond jewel of the development of the
aspiration to omniscience and therefore will not experience its qualities.
54. 310
“Noble one, a diamond cannot be dissolved.
 In the same way, the
diamond of the aspiration to enlightenment, which is the cause of
omniscience, cannot be dissolved.
2116
54. 311
“Noble one, the great diamond weapon can only be held by someone who
has the superior powerful strength and might of the great Nārāyaṇa, and not
by another strongman. In the same way, the great diamond weapon of the


---

development of the aspiration to omniscience can only be acquired by a
great bodhisattva whose limitless roots of merit are made firm by the power
of the cause of omniscience, which has superior powerful strength and
might like that of the great Nārāyaṇa. Otherwise, it cannot be held by any
other strongmen, who are the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas. [F.324.a]
54. 312
“Noble one, a diamond can pierce what no other weapon can pierce,
without itself being damaged. In the same way, wherever the weapons of
the prayers and wisdom of śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas are ineffective in
ripening and guiding beings, or in associating with the suffering that is
experienced during the kalpas of the three times, there the bodhisattva who
wields the great diamond weapon of the development of the aspiration to
omniscience is effective without weariness of mind, and without it being
unendurable, and without being adversely affected by it.
54. 313
“Noble one, a diamond can only be contained in a ground made of
diamond and not in any other place. In the same way, only the strong
diamond ground of the development of the aspiration to omniscience can
contain the diamond of the accumulations of the prayers that arise from a
bodhisattva, so that śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas cannot possess it.
54. 314
“Noble one, the container of the great ocean is the diamond ground that is
solid and without fissures so that water cannot leak through the cracks.
In the same way, the roots of merit of a bodhisattva that rest on the
uncracked ground of dedication of the diamond of the development of the
aspiration to enlightenment will never be exhausted throughout all
existences.
2117
54. 315
“Noble one, the great earth that rests on a foundation of diamond will
never be destroyed and will never degenerate. In the same way, the
bodhisattva prayers that are based upon the solid diamond ground of the
development of the aspiration to enlightenment will never be destroyed and
will never degenerate.
54. 316
“Noble one, a diamond will not rot if immersed in water. In the same way,
the diamond of the development of the aspiration to enlightenment will not
become rotten even if it remains for a kalpa in the water of all karma and
kleśas. [F.324.b]
54. 317
“Noble one, a diamond will not be burned or scorched by the heat of fire.
In the same way, the diamond of the development of the aspiration to
omniscience will not be burned by the heat of the fire of the sufferings of all
saṃsāra and will not be scorched by the burning fire of all the kleśas.
54. 318
“Noble one, when a tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha sits on the
bodhimaṇḍa, overcomes the māras, and attains omniscient buddhahood, no
place can be its location other than the ground that is the diamond center of
a world realm of a billion worlds. In the same way, all the strength, power,


---

and might of the bodhisattvas’ roots of merit from their prayers for the
attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment, their entry into patience,
their attainment of the bhūmis, their completion of the roots of merit, their
receiving their prophecy, their reliance
 on all the accumulations of the
bodhisattva path, their making offerings to all the tathāgatas, and their
holding all the great clouds of the Dharma can only be located on the solid
diamond center of the wisdom of all the prayers for the development of the
aspiration to omniscience, and other beings will not be able to possess it.
2118
54. 319
“Noble one, the development of the aspiration to omniscience has those
qualities and countless others; it possesses an indescribable extent of
indescribable special qualities. [F.325.a] Any being who develops the
aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment possesses the phenomena
of such qualities and will possess them going forward.
54. 320
“Therefore, noble one, you have gained an excellent attainment in
developing the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment, and in
order to attain these qualities you have sought bodhisattva conduct.
54. 321
“Noble one, you asked, ‘How does one perform bodhisattva conduct?
How does one practice it?’
“Noble one, go inside the great kūṭāgāra called Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra-
garbha and look! You will then know how a bodhisattva should train in
bodhisattva conduct and, having trained, what kind of qualities will be
accomplished.”
54. 322
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, circumambulated the bodhisattva
Maitreya, keeping him to his right, and then said, “Ārya, open the door of
the kūṭāgāra. I am going to enter.”
54. 323
The bodhisattva Maitreya came in front of the door of the Vairocana-
vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra. With his right hand he snapped his fingers,
and with that sound the door opened.
He said, “Noble son, enter the kūṭāgāra.”
54. 324
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was greatly amazed, and he entered
the kūṭāgāra. The instant he entered, the door closed by itself. He saw that
the kūṭāgāra was vast and immense, many hundreds of thousands of
yojanas wide; [F.325.b] as high as the surface of the sky; in all directions as
vast as space; adorned by countless parasols, banners, and flags; adorned by
countless jewels; adorned by countless hung strings of pearls; adorned by
countless hung strings of jewels; adorned by countless hung strings of red
pearls; adorned by countless hung strings of lion pearls; adorned by
countless lion banners; adorned by countless moons and half moons;
adorned by countless hung silk streamers of various colors; adorned by
countless silk flags of various colors; adorned by the lights of countless
nets
 of strings of jewels; adorned by countless nets of gold strings;
2119

adorned by countless streamers of jewels; adorned by countless cords of
gold beautified by jewels; adorned by countless bells with beautiful sounds;
adorned by countless strings of precious tiny bells that made beautiful
sounds when moved; adorned by rains of countless divine flowers; adorned
by countless hung streams of divine garlands; adorned by countless censers
from which flowed the aroma of incense sticks;
 adorned by countless
raindrops of gold dust; adorned by countless nets of upper balconies;
adorned by countless windows; adorned by countless toraṇas; [F.326.a]
adorned by countless pinnacles; adorned by countless mirrors; adorned by
countless precious cornices; adorned by countless precious panels; adorned
by countless pillars; adorned by countless clouds of precious cloths; adorned
by countless precious tree trunks; adorned by countless precious platforms;
adorned by countless precious pathways; adorned by countless precious
canopies; adorned by countless precious floors of various kinds; adorned by
countless precious kūṭāgāra adornments; adorned by countless precious
thrones; adorned by countless precious statues of females; adorned by
countless walkways overhung with precious streamers; adorned by
countless beautifully arranged pillars of banana trees made of Jambu River
gold; adorned by countless statues made of all precious materials; adorned
by countless statues of bodhisattvas; adorned by countless flocks of various
birds singing beautiful songs; adorned by countless precious lotuses;
adorned by countless precious supporting columns; adorned by countless
pools; adorned by countless white lotuses; adorned by countless stairways;
adorned by countless arrangements of daises;
 adorned by countless
various kinds of precious ground; [F.326.b] adorned by countless lights of
great precious jewels; adorned by countless arrangements of all jewels; and
adorned by countless perfect qualities and excellences.
2120
2121
54. 325
He saw within the kūṭāgāra another hundred thousand with this kind of
an array of adornments: adorned by countless precious parasols, banners,
and flags, and so on, adorned by countless perfect excellent qualities.
54. 326
He saw that all those kūṭāgāras were in that way vast, immense, and
immeasurable; were treasuries of space; and had been completely,
beautifully adorned.
54. 327
He saw that these kūṭāgāras were perfectly arranged so that in a single
perception they appeared in the manner of reflections that were separate
from one another, not mingled with one another, and distinct from one
another, and so that they appeared with all of them without exception being
perceived in a single perception.
54. 328
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having seen in that way the
inconceivable field of perception and miraculous manifestations of the
Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra, had great delight, and his


---

enthusiasm and aspiration increased by an immeasurable power of joy,
which saturated his mind and body; his mind was clarified of all
conceptualizations; his mind dispelled all obscurations; he was freed from all
ignorance; he entered the direction of the absence of delusion;
 [F.327.a]
he had hearing that perceived with the unimpeded memory of all sounds; he
had mentation that was free of all confusion; he had the power of
understanding that followed the way of unobscured liberation; he had
eyesight that reached all perceptions without obscuration; and with the
accomplishment of paying homage with his body while facing all directions
he paid homage by prostrating with the full length of his all-pervading body.
2122
54. 329
As soon as Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed down he perceived
that he had entered all those kūṭāgāras through the power of the
bodhisattva Maitreya’s blessing. He saw the many different and various
miraculous manifestations and inconceivable objects of perception inside
those kūṭāgāras. Inside some kūṭāgāras he perceived and comprehended
where the bodhisattva Maitreya first developed the prayer for the highest,
complete enlightenment: his birth into a family, what name he had, what
roots of merit he was inspired to, which kalyāṇamitras inspired him, his
lifespan, the name of the kalpa, and under which tathāgata in a realm with
what kinds of displays and in what kind of assembly he made which
particular prayers.
54. 330
He also perceived himself, during the entire lifetime of that tathāgata and
of those beings, to be at the feet of that tathāgata in that time, [F.327.b] and
he saw all those activities.
54. 331
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya at the time that he first
attained the samādhi of love.
54. 332
In some, he saw where he practiced conduct; in some, where he completed
the perfections; in some, where he entered the state of patience; in some,
where he ascended the bhūmis; in some, where he gained the displays of
buddha realms; in some, where he obtained the teaching of tathāgatas; in
some, where he attained the patience of the birthlessness of phenomena;
and in some, where he received the prophecy of his highest, complete
enlightenment, and everything about what kind of prophecy he received,
who gave the prophecy, and the length of time that was prophesied.
54. 333
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya being a cakravartin
establishing beings on the path of the ten good actions.

In some, he saw him being a lord of the world, benefiting the world and
gathering beings through all kinds of happiness; in some, being a Śakra,
turning beings away from delighting in sensory pleasures; in some, being a
Brahmā, describing to beings dhyāna and immeasurable joy; in some, being a
Suyāma deva lord, describing limitless qualities to beings; in some, being a

remaining; [F.328.a] in some, being a Sunirmita deva lord, manifesting the
array of emanations of all bodhisattvas to his retinue; in some, being a
Vaśavartin deva lord, displaying to the devas power over all phenomena; in
some, being a Māra, teaching to devas the impermanence of all good fortune;
and in some, being born in the dwelling of the lord of the asuras, teaching
the Dharma to his retinue of asuras in order that they forsake all pride,
arrogance, and conceit, enter the great ocean of wisdom,
 and attain the
illusory powers
 of the wisdom of the Dharma.
2123
2124
54. 335
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the realm of Yama, in which the light of the
bodhisattva Maitreya illuminated all the beings in the hells, so that all the
sufferings of the hells ceased for the beings who had been reborn in the
hells.
54. 336
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the realm of the pretas, in which the
bodhisattva Maitreya created much food and drink for the beings who had
been reborn in the preta realms, ending their hunger and thirst.
54. 337
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the worlds of animals, in which through taking
birth in their various kinds of physical existences he guided those beings
who had been reborn as animals.
54. 338

king; [F.328.b] in some, in the retinue of a Saṃtuṣita deva king; in some, in
the retinue of a Sunirmita deva king; in some, in the retinue of a Vaśavartin

to 
beginner 
bodhisattvas 
who 
had 
developed 
the 
aspiration 
to
enlightenment for the first time; in some, to those who were engaged in


---

bodhisattva conduct; in some, to those who had attained patience and were
irreversible; and in some, to those who were in their last lifetime and had
been consecrated by the buddhas.
54. 341
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw him describing the particular qualities of a
bhūmi to bodhisattvas who were on the first bhūmi, and in some he saw the
bodhisattva Maitreya discussing all the particular qualities of the bhūmis
with bodhisattvas on all ten bhūmis; in some, he had the completion of all
the perfections; [F.329.a] in some, he had infinite
 entries into all trainings;

he had profound liberations; in some he had pervaded the peaceful scope of
dhyāna, samādhi, samāpatti, and higher cognitions; in some, he entered the
bodhisattva’s conduct, guidance, and methods; and in some he had a vast
accomplishment of prayers.
2125
54. 342
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya accompanying
bodhisattvas who followed the same kind of conduct and spoke in
unison
 about engaging, in order to benefit beings, in the various specific
kinds of arts and treatises that bring benefit, happiness, and wealth to all
beings.
2126
54. 343

of all the buddhas.
2127
54. 344
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya dedicated to
walking
 for many hundreds of thousands of years.
2128
54. 345
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya dedicated to chanting

Dharma; in some, he was dedicated to discussing the Dharma; in some, he
was dedicated to writing out the Dharma; in some, he was resting in
meditation on love; in some, he was resting in meditation on all dhyānas and
immeasurables; in some, he was resting in meditation on all the āyatana
meditation states and liberations; [F.329.b] and in some, he was resting in
meditation in the samādhi of the method for accomplishing the higher
cognitions of a bodhisattva.
54. 346
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw many bodhisattvas resting in the bodhisattva
samādhi of emanations, and he saw many clouds of all emanations coming
from all the pores of all their bodies.
54. 347
From some of them, he saw many clouds of devas arising from all their
bodies and pores. From some of them, he saw many clouds of nāgas, yakṣas,

emanated beings arising from all their bodies and pores.
54. 348
From some of them, he heard various Dharma gateways coming from all
their bodies and pores, which means he heard the many sounds of entering
all Dharma doors such as the door of praising the qualities of bodhisattvas;
[F.330.a] the door of the perfection of generosity; the doors of the perfections
of conduct, patience, diligence, dhyāna, wisdom, method, prayer, strength,
and knowledge; the doors of the methods of gathering pupils, the dhyānas,

tathāgatas. He saw the various different births of those tathāgatas, their
different families, their countless different lifetimes,
 their different realms,
their different kalpas, their different teachings of the Dharma, their different
gateways of emanations,
 the different durations of their Dharmas, and so
on, up to all the different forms of their assemblies of followers without

2129
2130
54. 350
He saw in the center of the Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra one
kūṭāgāra that was greater and vaster than the others and was adorned with
adornments that were greatly superior to all the adornments, without
exception, of all the other kūṭāgāras.
54. 351
He saw within that kūṭāgāra a billion-world world realm. He saw in that
billion-world world realm the billion four-continent worlds and a billion
Jambudvīpas and a billion Tuṣita paradises.
54. 352
He saw within those Jambudvīpas the bodhisattva Maitreya being born
from within a lotus; being taken up by Śakra and Brahmā, walking seven
steps, gazing into the ten directions, and emitting the lion’s roar; manifesting
all the stages of youth; being within the harem; going to the park; turning
toward omniscience; setting forth and entering homelessness; manifesting
the practice of asceticism; eating food; going to the bodhimaṇḍa; engaging
in subjugating the māras; attaining the enlightenment of buddhahood;
gazing without closing the eyes at the Bodhi tree; being supplicated by


---

Mahābrahmā; turning the wheel of the Dharma; and passing away to divine
abodes, which was done through various different manifestations of the
range of attainments of buddhahood, followed by turning the wheel of the
Dharma in different ways, names, and forms, with various different lifespans,
with various different assemblies of followers, [F.331.a] with various
different manifestations of pure buddha realms, with various different
conduct and prayers, with various methods for presenting and teaching the
Dharma and for ripening beings, and with various different manifestations of
the distribution of relics and the power of the duration of the teachings.
54. 353
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, perceived himself to be at the feet of
them all.
54. 354
Through the blessing of the unfailing memory, all the steadfast
knowledge of all those assemblies of followers, all those manifestations of
activities, and all those different lifespans remained within his level of
comprehending knowledge.
54. 355
From all the nets of strings of bells and jingle bells, and from the music
and songs and all other perceived sounds, he heard the inconceivable
thunder from the clouds of the Dharma being emitted.
54. 356
He heard from them all the sounds of all the Dharma just as it had been
previously taught: from some he heard the different kinds of aspiration to
enlightenment; from some, the different kinds of conduct and prayer of the
perfections; from some, the different kinds of countless bhūmis; from some,
the different kinds of miraculous manifestation from inconceivable higher
cognitions; from some, the different kinds of various offerings to the
tathāgatas; from some, the different kinds of displays of buddha realms; and
from some, the different kinds of measureless clouds of the Dharma of the
tathāgatas.
54. 357
From some, he heard the words concerning entering into omniscience:
that in a world realm of such and such a name, [F.331.b] a bodhisattva with
such and such a name hears such and such a Dharma gateway, is inspired by
such and such a kalyāṇamitra, and at the feet of such and such a tathāgata
hears that in a kalpa with a certain name he will be present in a certain realm,
in a certain circle of followers, and having generated certain roots of merit
and having heard of certain buddha qualities will develop a certain
aspiration, and through a certain kind of prayer will develop the aspiration
to enlightenment and will practice bodhisattva conduct for a certain number
of kalpas, and will then attain the highest, complete enlightenment of
buddhahood, when he will have a certain name and a certain lifespan and
have a certain perfection of qualities and arrays of a buddha realm, and
through certain specific prayers will guide beings in a certain way and will


---

gather a certain following of śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, and when he
has passed into nirvāṇa his Dharma will remain for a certain number of
kalpas, and he will thus benefit beings in that way.
54. 358
From some, he heard that in a world realm of such and such a name, a
bodhisattva with such and such a name practices the perfection of
generosity, making a hundred gifts in a certain way of that which it is hard
to give away; that a bodhisattva with such and such a name maintains
correct conduct, meditates on patience, engages in diligence, [F.332.a] rests
in dhyāna, or practices the analysis of wisdom; that a bodhisattva with such
and such a name gives away his kingdom in order to search for the Dharma;
that he gives away his jewels, gives away his children, gives away his wives,
gives away his hands and feet, gives away his head, and jumps into fire; that
a bodhisattva with such and such a name holds the teaching of a tathāgata,
recites the Dharma, makes a gift of the Dharma, makes an offering of the
Dharma, raises the banner of the Dharma, beats the drum of the Dharma,
blows the conch of the Dharma, sends down a rain of the Dharma, holds the
teaching of a tathāgata, adorns the caitya of the Tathāgata, adorns the image
of the Tathāgata, gathers the articles that will bring happiness to beings, and
guards the treasure of the Dharma.
54. 359
From some, he heard that in a world realm of such and such a name, there
resided, lived, and remained a tathāgata with such and such a name,
teaching the Dharma through a consecration with a certain name, to a certain
assembly, in a certain buddha realm, in a certain kalpa, with a certain
lifespan, with certain Dharma teachings, guiding beings in a certain way,
and having attained buddhahood through certain prayers.
54. 360
In that way, he heard from all the perceived networks of bells and jingle
bells, music, and so on the words of countless different kinds of Dharma
doors. On hearing all those words, the mind of Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, became saturated with the vast power of joy [F.332.b] and
attained, through hearing, those Dharma doors. On hearing some, he
attained many doors of eloquence. On hearing some, he attained many doors
of the power of patience. On hearing some, he attained many doors of
conduct. On hearing some, he attained many doors of prayer. On hearing
some, he attained many doors of the perfections. On hearing some, he
attained many doors of the higher cognitions. On hearing some, he attained
many doors of gnosis and knowledge. On hearing some, he attained many
doors of liberations. On hearing some, he attained many doors of samādhis.
[B21]
54. 361
He saw in the mirrors countless reflections of images. In some he saw the
perception of the reflections of the assemblies of followers of tathāgatas; in
some he saw the perception of the reflections of the assemblies of followers


---

of bodhisattvas; in some, the perception of the reflections of the assemblies
of followers of śrāvakas; in some, the perception of the reflections of the
assemblies of followers of pratyeka buddhas; in some, the perception of the
reflections of the assemblies of followers of tathāgatas; in some, the
perception of the reflections of defiled realms; in some, the perception of the
reflections of pure realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of
defiled pure realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of purified
defiled realms; [F.333.a] in some, the perception of the reflections of world
realms with buddhas; in some, the perception of the reflections of world
realms without the presence of a buddha; in some, the perception of the
reflections of small world realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of
great world realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of narrow
world realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of vast
 world
realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of world realms that were
within magical illusion; in some, the perception of the reflections of world
realms that were sideways; in some, the perception of the reflections of
world realms that were upside-down; in some, the perception of the
reflections of world realms that were level; in some, the perception of the
reflections of world realms that were the abodes of the hell beings, animals,
and pretas; and in some, the perception of the reflections of world realms
filled with devas and humans.
2131
54. 362
He also saw countless bodhisattvas on the walkways and seated
 on
the thrones dedicated to a variety of necessities: some were walking, some
were in meditation, some were looking, some were filled great compassion
for beings, some were composing treatises on various subjects in order to
benefit the world, some were receiving scriptural transmission, some were
chanting it, some were writing it,
 [F.333.b] some were asking questions,
some were dedicated to The Confession of the Three Heaps and to dedication
prayers, and some were accomplishing prayers.
2132
2133
54. 363
He saw many nets of light of all the kings of jewels coming from the
pillars: from some came blue lights; from some, yellow; from some, red; from
some, white; from some, the color of crystal; from some, the color of gold;
from some, the color of sapphire; from some, the colors of the rainbow; from
some, the color of Jambu River gold; and from some, lights in every color;
which brought happiness to the body and mind and were supremely
beautiful.
54. 364
He saw that the pillars of banana trees made of Jambu River gold and the
hands of the statues made of all precious materials were hung
 with
clouds of flowers, and he saw that the hands were hung with wreaths of
garlands; the hands were draped with cloths; the hands held parasols,
banners, and flags; the hands held perfumes, incense, and ointments; the
2134


---

hands were hung with nets of strings of precious jewels;
 the hands were
hung with various jewels on various cords of gold; the hands were hung
with long necklaces of various pearls; the hands were hung with long
necklaces of various jewels; the hands were holding all kinds of adornments.
2135
54. 365
He saw that some were bowing down their topknot jewels and crowns,
staring with unblinking eyes, and paying homage with their palms placed
together.
54. 366
He saw that from the strings of pearls fell a gentle rain of water with the
eight good qualities that had the lovely aroma of various scents. [F.334.a]
54. 367
He saw many shining rows of lamps come from the nets of strings of beryl
jewels.
54. 368
He saw the precious parasols adorned by every kind of adornment and
decoration. He saw their interiors adorned by precious bells, nets of jingle
bells, silk streamers and tassels, precious tablets,
 and eggs
 made of
various kinds of precious jewels.
2136
2137
54. 369
He saw the ponds in which arose countless precious red lotuses, blue
lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses. He saw that some were a hand
span in size, some were a fathom in circumference, some were the size of
carriage wheels, on which were arrayed the adornments of various statues.
He saw that there were statues of women, statues of men, statues of boys,
statues of girls, statues of Śakra, statues of Brahmā, statues of the world
lords, and statues of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, śrāvakas, pratyeka buddhas, and bodhisattvas, and
also statues in the form of all beings with their many various colors and
bodies, all arranged paying homage, with their palms together and bowing
their bodies.
54. 370
He also saw statues of tathāgatas adorned with the thirty-two signs of a
great being and sitting cross-legged.
54. 371
He saw that the floor was a great ground made of beryl with a
checkerboard pattern, and within each of the squares there were countless
perceptions of reflections. [F.334.b]
 In some,
 he saw the perception of
reflections of realms; in some, the perception of reflections of bodhisattvas;
and in some, the perception of reflections of buddhas.
2138
2139
54. 372
He saw that reflections of the entire array of the adornments in the
kūṭāgāras appeared in each of the squares.
54. 373
He saw that from out of the entire treasury of the various flowers and
fruits of the precious trees emerged the upper halves of many bodies with
various shapes and various colors. He saw that from some emerged the
upper halves of the bodies of buddhas; from some emerged the upper halves
of the bodies of bodhisattvas; from some emerged the upper halves of the
bodies of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and


---

mahoragas; from some emerged the upper halves of the bodies of Śakra,
Brahmā, and world lords; from some emerged the upper halves of the bodies
of cakravartins and lords of humans; from some emerged the upper halves of
the bodies of young princes, head merchants, householders, ministers, men,
women, boys, girls, bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās.
54. 374
He saw that some of them had flower garlands hanging
 from their
hands; some of them had strings of jewels hanging from their hands; some of
them had all adornments held in their hands; some were bowing, with palms
together, and gazing with unblinking eyes; [F.335.a] some were praising;
some were resting in meditation; some were the color of gold; some were the
color of silver; some were the color of coral; some were the color of blue
beryl; some were the color of sapphires; some were the color of the radiance
of vairocana jewels; some were the color of magnolia flowers; some had
bodies of light; and some were beautified by the signs of a great being.
2140
54. 375
He saw that from the half moons emerged countless reflections of suns,
moons, planets, and stars.
54. 376
He saw that on all the walls of the buildings, divine palaces, and
kūṭāgāras there were checkerboard patterns made of all jewels.
54. 377
He saw within
 those jewel checkerboard patterns all the bodhisattva
Maitreya’s stages of bodhisattva conduct in his past practice of bodhisattva
conduct; in some of the squares he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya giving
away his head; in some, giving away his eyes; in some, giving away his
hands; in some, giving away his clothes;
 in some, giving away his crest
jewel; in some, giving away his crest jewel of righteousness;
 in some,
giving away his teeth; in some, giving away his tongue; in some, giving
away his ears; in some, giving away his nose; in some, giving away his heart;
in some, giving away his flesh and bone marrow; [F.335.b] in some, giving
away his blood; in some, giving away his skin and panniculus; in some,
giving away his fingernails and toenails with their flesh; in some, giving
away his fingers with their connecting webs; in some, giving away his sons,
daughters, and wives; in some, giving away heaps of jewels; in some, giving

some, giving away the royal throne; in some, giving away his male and
female slaves; in some, giving away his harem; in some, giving away his

freeing those condemned to death; in some, curing children; and in some,
showing the way to those who were lost; in some, he was a ferryman who
sailed his boat across the river; in some, he was Bālāha, the king of horses,
who saved the beings who had gone to the island of the rākṣasīs
 in the
great ocean; [F.336.a] in some, he was a great ṛṣi who created teaching
traditions; in some, he was a cakravartin who established beings on the path
of the ten good actions; in some, he was a physician who healed sickness; in
some, he was someone who honored his father and mother; in some, he was
someone who revered kalyāṇamitras; in some, he was dedicated to guiding
beings in the appearance and form of a śrāvaka; in some, he was dedicated
to guiding beings in the appearance and form of a pratyeka buddha; in some,
he was dedicated to guiding beings in the appearance and form of a
bodhisattva; in some, he was dedicated to guiding beings in the appearance
and form of a buddha; in some, he ripened beings through manifesting being
reborn in any of the particular births of beings; in some, in the form of a
dharmabhāṇaka, he entered the teachings of a tathāgata, received the
transmission of the teachings, recited the teachings, correctly analyzed them,
adorned the caitya of the Tathāgata, had statues of the Tathāgata made,
inspired beings to make offerings to the Tathāgata, anointed them with
perfumes and ointments, dressed them in bells and garlands, and so on, and
he was dedicated to making offerings to the Buddha and established beings
on the path of the ten good actions, established beings in the five precepts,
the eight poṣadha vows, taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha,
[F.336.b] entering mendicancy, hearing the Dharma, receiving the
transmission of the Dharma, reciting the Dharma, and contemplating it
correctly; and in order to talk about the Dharma he sat upon a lion throne
and explained the enlightenment of the buddhas.
2147
54. 378
In that way, the bodhisattva Maitreya practiced the six perfections for
countless hundreds of thousands of quintillions of kalpas. Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, saw all of that in various ways within each square of
the checkerboard patterns.
54. 379
He saw in some kūṭāgāras the bodhisattva Maitreya serving as many
kalyāṇamitras as there are, and all the array of miraculous manifestations
that came from that.
54. 380
Sudhana went before all those kalyāṇamitras, and he perceived them
speaking to him and giving an instruction: “Come here, Sudhana! Welcome!
Are you well? Look at this inconceivable range and display of miraculous
manifestations of the bodhisattva!”2148
54. 381
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw in each of the kūṭāgāras, and in
each object of perception, this and other ranges and displays of miraculous
manifestations. Because of his unfailing power of memory, his pure vision,


---

his view of all directions, and his unobscured wisdom of view in vipaśyanā,
he was established on the level of wisdom that comes from the
understanding of a bodhisattva, and therefore he saw all that infinite range
and display of miraculous manifestations. [F.337.a]
54. 382
It was like when a person goes to sleep and in a dream sees many various
particular perceived forms, such as delightful houses and divine palaces;
delightful villages, towns, districts, and regions; delightful parks, gardens,
and forest groves; delightful trees, rivers, pools, and mountains; delightful
clothes, food, drink, and enjoyments; and the enjoyment of the pleasures of
delightful songs, instrumental music, and percussive music. He perceives
himself in the company of his father, mother, friends, family, and relatives.
He sees the great ocean. He perceives Sumeru, the king of mountains, all
divine realms, and Jambudvīpas, in which he himself is many hundreds of
yojanas
 tall. He sees his house and environs as vast. He perceives them
to be adorned with all qualities and adornments. Even though he knows it is
daytime, he cannot tell if that day is long or short, or even know that this is a
dream. He perceives having all things that are pleasant, and he has the
appearance of his composite body being in a state of happiness, not sleeping
and free of all that is unpleasant, experiencing vast joy and happiness. He
thinks this lasts a long time: for a day, a week, a fortnight, a month, a year, a
hundred years, or longer, and when he wakes he remembers it all. [F.337.b]
2149
54. 383
In that way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, through the blessing of
the bodhisattva Maitreya, and through a knowledge that was free from a
limited perception, like that of someone who has entered a dream of the
three realms, was dwelling in the vast, extensive, unobscured perception of a
bodhisattva and possessed the comprehension that could follow the
inconceivable entry into the way of the bodhisattva and comprehend the
scope of the displays of a bodhisattva, and therefore he saw all of those
displays of miraculous manifestations, knew them, experienced them,
examined them, identified them, and beheld them. He also perceived himself
to be present among them.
54. 384
This is like when a sick person is in the final phase of his mind. In the
instant that occurs, his existing karma manifests: there is the ripening of
whatever kind of karma he has accumulated, so that on the basis of bad
karma he sees the hells, birth as an animal, the realm of the pretas, or the
servants of Yama holding menacing weapons and furiously shouting abuse;
he hears the sounds of the wailing and cries of the beings in the hells; he
sees the rivers of acid; he sees the mountains of rows of razor-blade edges,
the iron cotton trees, and the forests of sword blades; and he sees the beings
in hell on fire, burning, being incinerated, and all burning inside one iron


---

pot. [F.338.a] He perceives those harms being inflicted and those sensations
being experienced, and he sees and feels the suffering of the hell beings
being burned by fire.
54. 385
Through good karma he sees the palaces and dwellings of devas: he sees
the retinue of a deva, the groups of apsarases, and all the arrayed
adornments; he sees and experiences parks, forest groves, rivers, ponds,
precious mountains, wish-fulfilling trees, and many enjoyments, and he
perceives them to last for a lifetime.
54. 386
Even though he has not passed away from this world and has not been
reborn elsewhere, because of the inconceivable scope of karma, those kinds
of appearances are not imperceptible but are perceived and experienced.
54. 387
In the same way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, because of the
inconceivable scope of a bodhisattva’s karma, saw all that display of
miraculous manifestations.
54. 388
By analogy, when a person is overpowered by a demon spirit, they will
see many various kinds of forms, and whatever questions they ask, it will
reveal an answer to them. In the same way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, saw all those arrays through the power of the blessing of the
bodhisattva.
54. 389
By analogy, a person who goes into the dwelling of a nāga will enter into a
nāga’s perception [F.338.b] and will have the perception of a day, a week, a
fortnight, a month, a year, or a hundred years passing, but when they
separate from the nāga’s perception, they will see that in terms of human
perception only a moment
 has passed. In the same way, Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, having a mind that maintained the perception of a
bodhisattva and the blessing of the bodhisattva Maitreya, perceived in one
moment many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of kalpas.
2150
54. 390
By analogy, within Mahābrahmā’s divine palace, called Sarva jagadvara-
vyūha garbha, the perceived reflections of all the world realms in the billion-
world universe appear clearly and distinctly. In the same way, Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, saw the arising of all those displays, all those
perceptions, unmixed with one another and unmingled with one another.
54. 391
By analogy, a monk dwelling in the samāpatti of a meditative state of
totality in a singleness without duality, whether in his cell or on a
walkway,
 seated on a seat or standing up, perceives, sees, and
experiences the entire world as the inconceivable scope of his meditation,
the scope of his samāpatti of whichever meditative state of totality. [F.339.a]
In the same way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw and experienced
those displays according to whatever scope of perception he engaged in.
2151
54. 392
It was like the display and ornamentation of a gandharva city that appears
in the sky, which occurs without any obscuration.


---

54. 393
It was like the palace of a yakṣa being within a human palace, or a human
palace being within a yakṣa palace; they are inseparable but are perceived in
accordance with the purity of the scope of perception of a person’s
karma.2152
54. 394
It was like all the world realms of a billion-world universe appearing upon
a great ocean as reflections on the ocean.2153
54. 395
By analogy, a conjurer manifests all kinds of forms and activities through
the blessings of the power of mantras, spells, and potions. In the same way,
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw all the displays of miraculous
manifestations because of the bodhisattva Maitreya’s engagement in
inconceivable conjurations from blessing and wisdom. This was because of
his accomplishment of the power of conjuration from the knowledge of all
phenomena and because of conjuration through a bodhisattva’s power of
blessing and wisdom.
54. 396
Then the bodhisattva Maitreya entered the kūṭāgāra and, diminishing
those blessings, he snapped his fingers, saying to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, “Arise, noble one!
 Noble one, this is the nature of
phenomena. This is the blessing of the wisdom of a bodhisattva. It is the
characteristic of accomplishment from the practice of all Dharmas. [F.339.b]
They thus have no existing nature of their own. They are like conjurations,
dreams, and reflections.”
2154
54. 397
Then, with that finger snap, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, arose from
samādhi. The bodhisattva Maitreya then said to him, “Noble one, you have
seen the miraculous manifestations of the blessing of a bodhisattva. You
have seen the power and natural result of the accumulations of a
bodhisattva. You have seen accomplishments through the wisdom of the
prayers of a bodhisattva. You have seen the delightful abodes of a
bodhisattva. You have seen the accumulated conduct of a bodhisattva. You
have heard the doors through which the bodhisattvas come forth. You have
seen the immeasurable qualities and displays of the buddha realms. You
have seen the specific different prayers of the tathāgatas. You have followed
the inconceivable liberation of the bodhisattva. You have experienced the
delight and bliss of the bodhisattva’s samādhi.”
54. 398
Sudhana said, “Ārya, I have seen them through the blessing of the
kalyāṇamitra, through the intention of the kalyāṇamitra, and through the
power of the kalyāṇamitra. Ārya, what is this liberation called?”
Maitreya answered, “Noble one, this liberation is called the essence of the
display of the unfailing memory that engages with the knowledge of all objects of
perception in the three times.


---

54. 399
“Noble one, this
 kind of liberation, which is inexpressibly
inexpressible, is the attainment of a bodhisattva with one lifetime
remaining.” [F.340.a]
2155
54. 400
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, where is this display?”
The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “It is where it comes from.”
54. 401
Sudhana asked, “Where does it come from?”
The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “It comes from the accomplishment
of the blessing of the wisdom of a bodhisattva. It dwells within that blessing.
It does not come or go from anywhere. It does not accumulate. It does not
come together. It does not amass. It has no location as a thing. It has no
location as an object of perception. It has no location in any direction.
54. 402
“By analogy, noble one, the net of clouds of the nāgas is not located in the
body, is not located in the mind, is not located internally, and yet through the
power of a nāga’s mind and through the inconceivable power of a nāga
there is emitted a measureless flow of rain, which is not nonexistent and
appears. In the same way, noble one, those displays are not located
internally and are not located externally, but they become visible through the
power of a bodhisattva’s blessing and through your being a good vessel.
54. 403
“By analogy, noble one, a conjurer displays the entire range of illusions,
but they do not come from anywhere, do not go anywhere, and are not
transferred to anywhere, but through the power of mantra and concoctions,
they are perceived. In the same way, noble one, those displays do not go
anywhere, have not come from anywhere, and are not transferred anywhere,
but they are perceived through having trained in the inconceivable wisdom
conjurations of a bodhisattva and through the power of wisdom and the
blessing of past prayers.”
54. 404
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, from how far have you come?”
The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “Noble one, the movement of
bodhisattvas has no coming or going; [F.340.b] their motion is without
movement or stillness. Their motion is without basis or location. Their motion
is without passing away or rebirth. Their motion is without remaining or
going elsewhere. Their motion is without movement or rising. Their motion
is without dependence or location. Their motion is without karma or its
ripening. Their motion is without creation or cessation. Their motion is
without permanence or annihilation.
54. 405
“Moreover, noble one, the motion of bodhisattvas is great compassion
because it observes beings to be guided. The motion of bodhisattvas is
great
 love because it saves beings from suffering. The motion of
bodhisattvas is correct conduct because it regards everyone kindly. The
motion of bodhisattvas is prayer because of the blessings of the past. The
motion of bodhisattvas is higher cognition because it manifests itself
 to
2156
2157


---

all. The motion of bodhisattvas has no formation, as there is no movement
from being at the feet of all the tathāgatas. The motion of bodhisattvas has no
acquisition or rejection, because it is not focused on a body or mind. The
motion of bodhisattvas is wisdom and method because it follows all beings.
The motion of bodhisattvas is the manifestation of emanations because it is
like a mirage, a reflection, or an illusory manifestation.

“Moreover, noble one, you asked, ‘From how far have you come?’
Noble son, I come here from a hamlet called Kuṭi in the land of the Māladas,
which is the place of my birth.
 In that place there was a head merchant by
the name of Gopālaka. After I had established him in the Buddha’s Dharma,
[F.341.a] I taught the Dharma, in accordance with the nature of the recipients,
to the people of my birthplace. After I had inspired my parents, family, and
relatives
 and brahmins and householders to enter the Mahāyāna, I came
here.”

Sudhana asked, “Ārya, where are the birthplaces of the bodhisattvas?”
Maitreya replied, “Noble one, there are ten birthplaces of the bodhisattvas.
What are the ten?
54. 408
(1) “The aspiration to enlightenment is a birthplace of the bodhisattvas
because it is birth into the family of bodhisattvas. (2) The higher motivation is
a birthplace of the bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of
kalyāṇamitras. (3) Being upon the bhūmis is a birthplace of the bodhisattvas
because it is birth into the family of the perfections. (4) The accomplishment
of prayer is a birthplace of the bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family
of bodhisattva conduct. (5) Great compassion is a birthplace of the
bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of all the methods of
gathering pupils. (6) The correct realization of the nature of phenomena is a
birthplace of the bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of the
perfection of wisdom. (7) The Mahāyāna is a birthplace of the bodhisattvas
because it is birth into the family of skillful methods. (8) Ripening beings is a
birthplace of the bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of complete
buddhahood. (9) Method and wisdom are a birthplace of the bodhisattvas
because they are birth into the family of patience from the birthlessness of
phenomena. (10) Noble one, the practice of the Dharma is a birthplace of the
bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of all past, future, and present
tathāgatas. [F.341.b] Noble one, those ten are the birthplaces of the
bodhisattvas.
54. 409
“Noble one, method and wisdom are the father of the bodhisattvas; the
perfection of wisdom is their mother; the perfection of generosity is their wet
nurse; the perfection of conduct is their nanny; the perfection of patience is
their adornment and jewelry; the perfection of diligence is their growing up;
the perfection of meditation is their correct conduct; the kalyāṇamitras are

their training in conduct; all the aspects of enlightenment are their
companions; all the qualities of the roots of merit are their friends; all the
bodhisattvas are their brothers; the aspiration to enlightenment is their
family; their practice is the qualities of their family; being upon the bhūmis is
being in their family; attaining patience is being born into the family;
accomplishing prayer is inheriting the knowledge of the family; pure
conduct is gaining the qualities of the family; inspiring others to the
Mahāyāna is maintaining the continuity of the family; being consecrated as
having one life remaining is being the senior son of a Dharma king; and
attaining becoming a tathāgata is purifying the lineage of the family.
54. 410
“Noble one, in that way, the bodhisattvas transcend the level of different
foolish beings; enter the faultlessness of a bodhisattva; enter the family of
the tathāgatas; are within the lineage of the tathāgatas; practice to maintain
the continuity of the family of the Three Jewels; are dedicated to
protecting
 the family of the bodhisattvas; [F.342.a] make the family and
clan pure; do not cause the vital lineage to decline; have no fault of
transgression in the family that could be criticized by any of the beings in the
world including its devas, its māras, its Brahmā deities, and its śramaṇas and
brahmins; and have the nobility of their family because through being born
in the supreme family of the buddhas they possess a body of great prayer.
2161
54. 411
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who have such a family lineage know all
phenomena to be like reflections, so they are not revolted by births in all
worlds. Knowing that all births in existences are like magical illusions, they
are born in and remain within the various modes of existence without being
afflicted by them. They have comprehended the absence of a self in
everything and therefore do not become wearied in ripening and guiding
beings. They possess bodies of great love and great compassion and
therefore do not become fatigued in benefiting beings. They have realized
that all saṃsāra is like a dream and therefore do not become disheartened in
remaining in it throughout all kalpas. They know that all the skandhas are
like conjured illusions, and therefore they are not made despondent by all
manifestations of birth, passing away, and death. They have realized the
dhātus
 and āyatanas to have the nature of the realm of phenomena and
are therefore not wounded by anything in the range of sensory possessions.
They meditate on all forms of perception as being like mirages and therefore
have no aspiration for any of the joys of saṃsāra. They play with all
phenomena as being like conjured illusions and therefore are unstained
by any scope of the māras. [F.342.b] They have Dharma bodies
 and
therefore are not brought down by the kleśas. And they have attained power
over rebirth and therefore realize and comprehend all classes of existence.

“Noble son, in that way, I have spread throughout the realm of
phenomena with a body that enters birth in all world realms, with the
particular appearances
 that are congruent with the forms of all beings,
with specific definitions that are congruent
 with all beings, with various
names that are congruent
 with all beings, with conduct that is congruent
with the aspirations of all beings, with a conformity to worlds that is
congruent
 with guiding all beings, with the manifestations of lifespans
and births in families that are congruent with the beings who are to be
purified, with gateways of entry into activities that are congruent with all the
conducts of foolish beings,
 with an engagement in knowledge that is
congruent with all the forms of perception of beings,
 and with the
manifestations and splendor
 of bodies that are congruent with all the
emanations from the prayers of bodhisattvas.

“Noble one, in order to ripen those beings who in the past practiced in the
same way as I did but lost aspiration for enlightenment, and in order to
manifest a birth and life in Jambudvīpa, I was born in the brahmin castes in
this hamlet called Kuṭi in the lands of the Māladas in this southern region. I
was born here so as to guide my father, mother, family, and relatives, to
dispel arrogance among those in the particular brahmin castes who were
proud of their birth into those castes, and so that they would be born in the
family of the tathāgatas. [F.343.a]
54. 414
“Noble one, in that way, I dwell in this Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha
kūṭāgāra here in this southern region, ripening and guiding beings in
whatever way is necessary and according to their aspirations through these
kinds of methods.
54. 415
“When I die and pass away from here, I will manifest taking birth in the
Tuṣita paradise in order to take care of beings in accordance with their
aspirations; in order to ripen the Tuṣita devas whose conduct accords with
mine; in order to manifest a bodhisattva’s merit, wisdom, and display of
miracles to all those who have transcended the realm of desire; in order to
dispel craving for desired pleasures; in order to teach the impermanence of
all that is composite;
 in order to teach their eventual decline to all those
who have been born as devas; in order to discuss,
 together with
bodhisattvas who have one lifetime remaining, the Dharma gateway to great
wisdom; in order to gather together those born there who have been ripened
together with me; and in order to cause the lotuses of the guidance sent forth
by the Tathāgata Śākyamuni to blossom. When the time has come for my
intentions to be fulfilled, I will set out to attain omniscience, and when I have
attained enlightenment, you will see me again, together with the
kalyāṇamitra Mañjuśrī.
2172

54. 416
“Depart, noble one. Go again into the presence of the bodhisattva
Mañjuśrī and ask him, ‘How should bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva
conduct? [F.343.b] How should they practice it? How should they
comprehend the field of completely good conduct? How should they
accomplish it? How should they pray for it? How should they increase it?
How should they follow it? How should they master
 it? How should they
enter it? How should they perfect it?’ Then that kalyāṇamitra will teach you.
2174
54. 417
“Why is that? Because Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has a special prayer for the
accomplishment of that conduct, which a hundred thousand quintillion
bodhisattvas do not have. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has accomplished
countless prayers. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has accomplished countless
special bodhisattva qualities. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta is like a mother for a
hundred thousand quintillion buddhas. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta teaches
instructions to a hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas. Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta is dedicated to ripening and guiding all realms of beings.
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has spread the wheel of his name throughout the
world realms of the ten directions. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta is a person who
has spoken to all the assembled followers of the tathāgatas. Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta is extolled and praised by all the tathāgatas. Mañjuśrī Kumāra-
bhūta sees all phenomena exactly as they are and practices the wisdom of
the profound Dharma. [F.344.a] Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has the scope of
conduct that has gone far in the ways of all liberations and follows the
completely good bodhisattva conduct.
54. 418
“Noble one, that kalyāṇamitra is the one who has given birth to you into
the family of the tathāgatas; he is the one who has increased your roots of
merit;
 he is the one who has caused you to look for
 bodhisattva
accumulations; he is the one who has revealed
 the kalyāṇamitras to you;
he is the one who has inspired you toward all qualities; he is the one who
caused you to enter the net of great prayers; he is the one who has
established you in the accomplishment of prayers; he is the one who caused
you to hear the secrets of all the bodhisattvas; he is the one who has taught
you all the inconceivabilities of the bodhisattvas; and he is the one who has
practiced together with you in your past lives.
2175
2176
2177
2178
54. 419
“Therefore, noble one, be again at the feet of Mañjuśrī, and do not weary
or be disheartened while receiving all the instructions for the qualities. Why
is that? It is because, Sudhana, you should see that all the kalyāṇamitras that
you have seen, all the gateways to conduct that you have heard, however
many liberations you have engaged in, and whatever specific prayers you
have been immersed in are all because of the power and blessing of Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta.”

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, circumambulated him many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from the bodhisattva Maitreya. [F.344.b]
