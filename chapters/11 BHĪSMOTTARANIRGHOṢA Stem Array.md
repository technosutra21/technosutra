11. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, thinking of following the
bodhisattva instructions, thinking of following the pure conduct of
bodhisattvas, thinking of increasing the strength of the merit of
bodhisattvas, thinking of the illumination of the power of seeing the
buddhas, thinking of developing the power to attain the treasure of the
Dharma, [F.376.a] thinking of increasing the power of accomplishing the
great prayers, thinking of facing every direction in the realm of the Dharma,
thinking of the illumination of the nature of the Dharma, thinking of the
dispersal of all obscurations, thinking of looking at the realm of Dharma free
of darkness, thinking of the motivation
 that is stainless and unbreakable
like Nārāyaṇa’s
 precious vajra, and thinking of invincibility and
unassailability in the face of all the māra armies, eventually arrived in the
land of Nālayu.

He searched and searched for the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa. At that time,
the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa was dwelling in an ashram in a delightful forest
of countless different kinds of trees and creepers. In that forest there was a
canopy of the leaves of various trees, there were always flowers blossoming
on trees of various kinds, and there were fruit trees always laden with fruit.
Platforms of precious fruit had formed at the feet of trees that were made of
the 
various 
kinds 
of 
precious 
materials. 
There 
were 
beautifully
proportioned
 tall sandalwood trees. The forest was made pleasant by the
aroma that constantly came from beautiful agarwood trees. It was beautified
by scents in all four directions. It was adorned by perfectly proportioned
bignonia trees.
 There were beautifully formed banyan trees. Ripened fruits
were constantly falling from jambul trees. It was beautified by fresh red
lotuses, blue lotuses, and night lotuses.

Sudhana saw the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa and circumambulated the ṛṣi
Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa a hundred thousand times, keeping him to his right.

The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa was seated under a canopy of interlaced
sandalwood branches. [F.376.b] His hair was bound into a topknot of matted
locks, he wore clothing made of skins and grass, with a skirt of bark, and he
was seated on a cushion of grass.
Sudhana approached the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa.
11. 5
When he had approached him, seeing that omniscience arises from the
gateway of the kalyāṇamitra, the genuine kalyāṇamitra that one wishes to
find, because the kalyāṇamitra teaches the true path; seeing that
omniscience is dependent on the instructions of the kalyāṇamitra because
they lead one to the level of omniscience; seeing that omniscience is
dependent on the friendship of the kalyāṇamitra because they lead one to
the island of the jewels of the wisdom of the ten strengths; seeing that
omniscience is the illumination from the lamp of the kalyāṇamitra because
they create the light of the wisdom of the ten strengths; seeing that the
kalyāṇamitra is the road to omniscience because they lead one to the city of
unimpaired omniscience, seeing that omniscience is the lamp of the
kalyāṇamitra because they reveal that which is equal and unequal; seeing
that the kalyāṇamitra is the bridge
 of omniscience because they eliminate
all the fear of falling into crevasses; seeing that the kalyāṇamitra is the
parasol of omniscience because they cool through the power of great
benevolence; seeing that the kalyāṇamitra is the power of omniscience
because they create great compassion; and seeing that reliance on the
kalyāṇamitra is the clear vision of omniscience because they illuminate the
way of the nature of phenomena, [F.377.a] Sudhana threw his body onto the
ground before him, prostrating to him. He then rose, circumambulated the ṛṣi
Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to
his right, and then sat down before him. With his hands together in homage
in a pleasing way with pleasing words, he said, “Ārya, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment. How does a bodhisattva
train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva practice it?
708
11. 6
“Ārya, I have heard that you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas.
Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct
and in what way they practice it!”
11. 7
The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa looked at the ten thousand brahmin
youths who were there and said, “Young men, this noble one has developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment. He has invited all
beings to become free of fear. This noble one is prepared to bring happiness
and benefit to all beings. He is facing an ocean of wisdom. He longs to drink
the rain of the clouds of Dharma of all the tathāgatas. He longs to enter the
ocean of all the ways of the Dharma. He longs to be in the great light of
709

wisdom. He longs for the great rain of the Dharma to fall. He longs for the
moon of great wisdom to rise over the world and extinguish all the torment
of the kleśas. He longs to increase the roots of merit of all beings.”
11. 8
Then the ten thousand brahmin youths scattered beautiful flowers with
lovely aromas and in various colors over Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
[F.377.b] strewed them over him, covered him with them, paid homage to
him, bowed down to him, circumambulated him, keeping him to their right,
and then said these words to him: “This one will become a protector of all
beings; he will end all the sufferings in the hells, he will block all the
pathways to rebirth as animals, he will turn beings away from the path that
leads to the world of Yama, he will close the doors to the unfortunate
existences, he will dry up the ocean of existences, he will cut through the
bondage of existences, he will repel the mass of suffering, he will dispel the
darkness of ignorance, he will establish a Cakravāla mountain range of merit
around the world, he will reveal the source of the jewels of wisdom, he will
cause the sun of wisdom to rise, he will purify the eyes of Dharma, and he
will reveal that which is equal and unequal in all the worlds.”
11. 9
Then the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa said to those youths, “Young men,
when someone has developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment and practices bodhisattva conduct, they create happiness for
all beings and will eventually attain omniscience. Young men, this noble one
has developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, and
therefore he will bring to completeness all the qualities of buddhahood.
[F.378.a]
11. 10
Then the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the banner of
being invincible to others.”
11. 11
Sudhana asked, “What is the scope of this bodhisattva liberation called the
banner of being invincible to others?”
The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa extended his right hand and with it stroked
and held the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
11. 12
As soon as the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa held the head of Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, with his right hand, Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, saw in the ten directions buddha realms as numerous as the atoms in a
million buddha realms; he perceived himself to be sitting at the feet of
buddhas as numerous as the atoms in a million buddha realms; he saw the
countless pure displays of forms within those buddha realms; he saw the
ocean of the multicolored display of the circles of followers of those
tathāgatas; he saw in the midst of those oceans of the circles of followers the
bodies of the tathāgatas, which were adorned with the shining signs and
features of a great being; he listened to their Dharma teachings without

missing a single word or term; he obtained those Dharma wheels of the
tathāgatas, each distinct from the other; he received the rain of Dharma that
fell according to the various aspirations of beings; and he comprehended an
ocean of the past prayers of those tathāgatas, which were purified by the
power of various aspirations; [F.378.b] he also comprehended those pure
oceans of various prayers, which were oceans that had been accumulated by
the buddhas; he also saw the perception of the colors of the bodies of the
buddhas that satisfied beings in accordance with their wishes; he also saw
the network of light rays from the buddhas as various passionless, pure
displays of halos; and he also perceived the strengths of those buddhas that
possessed the unobscured radiance of wisdom.
11. 13
In that way, he was illuminated by the light of wisdom from the
bodhisattva liberation called the banner of being invincible to others; he attained
the illumination of the samādhi called the essence of the sun; he possessed the
samādhi called the liberation of unceasing wisdom; he obtained the sight of the
gateway of retention called the network in all directions; he attained the
samādhi called the range of the summit of well-ordered knowledge;
 he had the
range of dwelling in the perfection of wisdom, which is the path
 with the
complete array of foundations; he gained the light of the samādhi called the
buddhas’ domain of the essence of space; his mind was illuminated by the samādhi
called the rim of the Dharma wheel of all the buddhas; and he attained the light of
the samādhi called the domain of the unceasing precious knowledge of the three
times.

He perceived sitting at the feet of some tathāgatas for one day and night,
at the feet of some for seven days, at the feet of some for half a month, at the
feet of some for one month, at the feet of some for one year, at the feet of
some for a hundred years, at the feet of some for a thousand years, at the feet
of some for a hundred thousand years,
 at the feet of some for ten million
years, [F.379.a] at the feet of some for a billion years, at the feet of some for

a quintillion years, at the feet of some for half a kalpa, at the feet of some for

thousand kalpas, at the feet of some for a hundred thousand kalpas, at the
feet of some for ten million kalpas, at the feet of some for a billion kalpas, at
the feet of some for ten billion kalpas, at the feet of some for a trillion kalpas,
at the feet of some for a quintillion kalpas, at the feet of some for an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of kalpas, at the feet of some tathāgatas for as
many kalpas as there are atoms in Jambudvīpa, and so on up to at the feet of
some tathāgatas for as many kalpas as there are atoms in an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of buddha realms.

11. 15
Then the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa released Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, and Sudhana perceived again that he was sitting at the feet of the ṛṣi
Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa.
11. 16
The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa asked him, “Noble one, do you remember?”
Sudhana replied, “Ārya, I remember the blessing of the kalyāṇamitra.”
11. 17
The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa said, “Noble one, I know only this
bodhisattva liberation called the banner of being invincible to others. How could I
know or describe the qualities, indicate the different prayers, know the
formation of realms, comprehend the scope of the wisdom, follow the range
of the samādhis, comprehend the miracles and emanations that follow the
arising of the might and display of the powerful liberations, grasp the
characteristics of the different bodies, describe the pure domain of the
voices, or teach the radiance of the wisdom of the bodhisattvas who have
attained the samādhis that have the clairvoyant knowledge that is superior
to all beings, who have power over the wheel of time,
 who are skilled in
the accomplishment of the knowledge of the signs of buddhahood,
 who
perceive the display of the rising of the sun of the tathāgatas, [F.379.b] who
have accumulated the knowledge of the single characteristic of the range of
the three times,
 who have bodies that are distributed through all world
realms, who have bodies
 of wisdom that illuminate the entire realm of
phenomena, who appear in accordance with the wishes of all beings, who
practice an appropriate conduct in a way that is in accordance with the
aspirations of beings, who shine in a way that delights, and who have the
pure domain of stainless radiant wisdom?

“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land called Īṣāṇa, there
dwells a brahmin by the name of Jayoṣmāyatana. Go to him and ask him,
‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
11. 19
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was overjoyed, pleased, happy,
and content. He bowed his head to the feet of the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa,
circumambulated the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa, keeping him to his right,
many hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking back again and again,
departed from the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa. [F.380.a] [B32]
