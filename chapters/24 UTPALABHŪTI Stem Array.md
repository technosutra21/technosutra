UTPALABHŪTI
24. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had no regard for his life or body; he had
no regard for engaging in dedication to obtaining and possessing the
pleasures of existence; [F.46.a] he had no regard for the objects of perception
that beings delight in; he had no regard for forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and
textures; he had no concern for enjoying retinues and pleasures; he had no
regard for any of the pleasures of the power of kingship and sovereignty; he
was focused on attaining the highest purification of a buddha realm for the
pure ripening and guiding of all beings; he was focused on never being
satisfied with the extent of his offering to, honoring, and serving all the
tathāgatas; he was focused on all phenomena with the wisdom that knows
their nature;
 he was focused on the qualities of bodhisattvas so that there
would be no decline in his practice, which had the entire ocean of those
qualities as its goal; he was focused on the great prayers of all bodhisattvas
so as to maintain bodhisattva conduct throughout all kalpas; he was focused
on entering the ocean of the circles of the followers of all tathāgatas; he was
focused on all gateways of bodhisattva samādhis so as to manifest the
attainment of all countless bodhisattva samādhis through each samādhi
gateway; he was focused on all the light of wisdom of all Dharma wheels so
as to never be satisfied with the extent of his obtaining Dharma wheels from
all the tathāgatas; and he was focused on the kalyāṇamitras, who are the
source of qualities, because the kalyāṇamitras are the source of the qualities
of the buddhas, the bodhisattvas, and others.

Sudhana eventually arrived at the land called Pṛthurāṣṭra. He looked and
searched for the perfume-seller head merchant by the name of Utpalabhūti.
He saw the perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti and approached him.
[F.46.b] After approaching him, Sudhana bowed his head to the perfume-
seller head merchant Utpalabhūti’s feet, circumambulated the perfume-seller
head merchant Utpalabhūti many hundreds of thousands of times, and sat

down before the perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti. With his hands
placed together in homage, he said, “Ārya, I seek the wisdom that is the
same as that of all the buddhas. I rejoice in the fulfillment of the field of
prayers made in the past by all the buddhas, I rejoice in the accomplishment
of the Dharma body of all the buddhas, I seek the wisdom body of all the
buddhas, I rejoice in the purification of all the fields of bodhisattva conduct, I
rejoice in the light of all the fields of bodhisattva samādhis, I rejoice in the
stability of all the fields of the bodhisattva power of mental retention, I
rejoice in the dispelling of the entire field of kleśas, I seek to travel in all the
fields of the realms, and I have set out upon the highest complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it, and how through
having practiced in that way all bodhisattvas become omniscient.”
24. 3
Utpalabhūti said to him, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you
have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.
24. 4
“Noble one, I know all perfumes. I know about all combined perfumes, all
incenses, all combinations of perfumes and incenses, all ointments, all
combined ointments, all powders, all combinations of powders, and all
perfumes, ointments, and powders. [F.47.a]
24. 5
I know the perfumes of the devas. I also know the perfumes of the nāgas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and
nonhumans.
24. 6
“I know the perfumes that heal sickness. I also know the perfumes that
dispel unhappiness, the perfumes that give rise to worldly happiness, the
perfumes that cause the kleśas to blaze, the perfumes that cause kleśas to
cease, the perfumes that create various kinds of composite happiness and
bliss, the perfumes that create composite sadness, the perfumes that dispel
all intoxication and carelessness,
 the perfumes that accomplish a
continuous focus on the buddhas, the perfumes of understanding the way of
the Dharma, the perfumes of ārya conduct, the various bodhisattva
perfumes, and the perfumes of being established on all the bodhisattva
levels. I know the aspects of all those perfumes. I also know their origin,
creation, accomplishment, perfection, purification, elimination, combination,
usage, object, power, action, and cause.

24. 7
“Noble one, in the world there is the perfume called elephant essence that
disconcerts the nāgas.
 A pellet merely the size of a sesame seed will
pervade the entire land of Pṛthurāṣṭra with a thick net of a cloud of perfume.
For seven days there will fall a fine rain of scented water. At that time, when
that scented water falls on any being’s body or clothing, all their bodies and
clothing will become adorned with golden flowers. [F.47.b]
 Those beings
who are indoors and smell the scent that is brought in by the breeze from
1092

that net of clouds of perfume will all have increased happiness and
aspiration for seven days and will experience various kinds of mental and
physical happiness and pleasure, and they will have no illness that is caused
by the disturbance of the elements in their bodies or is the result of harm
caused by others. They will have no suffering or unhappiness. They will
have no fear, no terror, no apprehension, no disturbance of mind, and no
malice. For seven days there will arise happiness and joy, and they will be
kind to one another.
24. 8
“Noble one, in order to purify the thoughts of those who are experiencing
happiness and joy, I teach them the Dharma so that they will definitely have
the highest, complete enlightenment.
24. 9
“Moreover, noble one, there is sandalwood called gośīrṣa that comes from
the Malaya mountains. If you rub it on your body, you can jump into a great
fire and you will not be burned.
24. 10
“Noble one, there is a perfume called invincible that comes from the ends of
the ocean. If you rub it on a drum or a horn, its sound will defeat all the
followers of others.
24. 11
“Noble one, there is the black agarwood called lotus essence that comes
from Lake Anavatapta. The smell from a pellet the size of a sesame seed will
fill all of Jambudvīpa. Every being that smells that perfume will renounce
bad actions and gain a controlled mind.
24. 12
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called luminescent that comes from
the Himalaya, the king of mountains. If one smells its scent, the mind will
become freed from desire. I teach them the Dharma so that they will attain
the samādhi called the stainless field. [F.48.a]
24. 13
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called the essence of the sea that comes
from the land of the rākṣasas and has been produced for the enjoyment of a
cakravartin king. As soon as he is perfumed by it, the cakravartin’s
fourfold
 army appears in the sky.
1094
24. 14
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called array of beauty
 that comes
from Sudharma, the assembly hall of the devas. As soon as the devas are
perfumed by it, they gain the memory of the pleasant aroma of the buddhas.
1095
24. 15
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called pure treasure in the paradise of
Suyāma, the king of devas. As soon as they are perfumed by it, all Suyāma’s
devas come before deva king Suyāma, and when they are in his presence,
the deva king Suyāma talks to them about the Dharma.
24. 16
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called chaste tree in Tuṣita. When its
aroma reaches bodhisattvas with one life remaining and who are upon their
Dharma seats, a great cloud of perfume fills the entire realm of phenomena,
and from great Dharma clouds that have a variety of adornments a rain falls
onto all the circles of followers of the tathāgatas.

24. 17
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called captivating in the paradise of
the deva king Sunirmita. When there is that aroma in the paradise of the
deva king Sunirmita, there falls an inconceivable rain from clouds of Dharma
for seven days.
24. 18
“Noble one, I know how to combine perfumes, but how could I know the
conduct or describe the qualities of those bodhisattvas who have no stain of
faults and have transcended the entire realm of desire, who are free from the
noose of the māra of the kleśas, who have transcended all the continuums of
the states of existence, who perform conduct with bodies and the aspect of
the illusion of wisdom, who are unstained by any world, [F.48.b] who have
the state of being without desire, who have the pure field of wisdom that is
unobscured, who have the range and scope of unimpeded wisdom, who do
not dwell in any basis or location, and who know the conduct of those who
move in all the bases and locations of existence? How could I elucidate the
gateway of their pure practice of correct conduct? How could I describe their
faultless conduct? How could I teach their continuum of body, speech, and
mind that is devoid of harmful conduct?
24. 19
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, there is a town named
Kūṭāgāra. There dwells a mariner by the name of Vaira. Go to him and ask
him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
24. 20
“Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
the perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti, circumambulated the
perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti a hundred thousand times,
keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed from
the presence of the perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti.
