Chapter 32
MAHĀDEVA
32. 1
Sudhana had a mind that followed the vast conduct of bodhisattvas. He had
the nature of longing for the scope of the wisdom of the bodhisattva
Ananyagāmin. He saw the special qualities of accomplishing great higher
cognition. He had attained joy in the armor of stable diligence. He had the
aspiration to follow the displays
 of inconceivable liberations. He
practiced the qualities of the bodhisattva level. He analyzed on the level of
samādhi. He was established on the level of the power of retention. He
engaged in the level of prayer. He trained in the level of discernment. He
was accomplishing the level of power.
1270
32. 2
He eventually arrived at the city named Dvāravatī. He inquired about the
deity Mahādeva, and many people declared to him, “Noble one, this
 deva
Mahādeva is in the temple
 at the crossroads of the city, and with
greatness of being he is teaching the Dharma to beings.”
1271
1272
32. 3
Then Sudhana went to where the deity Mahādeva was. He bowed his
head to the feet of Mahādeva, stood before him with his hands together in
homage, and said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment. How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva
conduct? In what way does a bodhisattva practice it? Ārya, I have heard that
you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas. Therefore, Ārya, teach me
how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
practice it!”
32. 4
The deity Mahādeva extended his four arms, and from the four great
oceans and with the power of great speed he brought water and washed his
mouth. [F.76.a] He then scattered golden flowers on Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, and said, “Noble one, it is very difficult to see the
bodhisattvas. It is difficult to hear them. The appearance of the white lotuses
that are supreme beings is a great marvel because of its greatness; they are a
support for the world, a refuge for beings; they create a great light for


---

beings; they teach the path of truth to those on the path of ignorance; they
are guides for those who follow the way of the Dharma; they are great
guides for going to the city of omniscience.
32. 5
“Noble one,
 this is what I think: the bodhisattva mahāsattvas are called
the destroyers of wrong views because, with stainless minds, they manifest the
appearance of their pure bodies; they manifest the activities
 of their pure
bodies; they shine the light of eloquence of their faultless speech; and with a
pure motivation they remain manifest at all times.
1273
1274
32. 6
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the net of
clouds.”
Sudhana asked him, “What is the scope of the bodhisattva liberation called
the net of clouds?”
32. 7
In every direction in front of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, the deva
Mahādeva manifested mountain-sized heaps of gold, heaps of silver, heaps
of beryls, heaps of crystals, heaps of white corals, heaps of emeralds, heaps
of precious asteria jewels, heaps of precious vimalagarbha jewels, heaps of
precious vairocana jewels, heaps of precious topknot jewels, heaps of crowns,
heaps of necklaces made of various precious jewels, [F.76.b] heaps of
armlets, heaps of earrings, heaps of bracelets, heaps of girdles, heaps of
anklets, heaps of strings of red pearls,
 heaps of various precious jewels,
heaps of adornment for the greater and smaller parts of the body, heaps of
the kings of wish-fulfilling precious jewels, all flowers, all perfumes, all
incenses, all garlands, all ointments, all powders, all cloths, all parasols, all
banners, all flags, all musical instruments, all percussion instruments, all that
is desirable, and countless trillions of maidens.
1275
32. 8
Mahādeva said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, take
these, and with them perform acts of great generosity! Create much merit!
Make offerings to the tathāgatas! Gather many beings through generosity as
a method of gathering pupils! Practice the perfection of generosity! Teach
the world through generosity!
 Give that which is difficult to give!
1276
1277
32. 9
“Noble one, I gather for you this manner of things, and in that same way I
establish in generosity an incalculable number of beings whose minds have
an unceasing motivation to give. I cause them to generate roots of merit in
the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha and the bodhisattvas and kalyāṇamitras,
and I inspire them toward the highest, complete enlightenment.
32. 10
“Moreover, noble one, I bless with the ugliness of sensory objects those
beings who are intoxicated by the joys of desire and have attachment to the
enjoyment of sensory objects. [F.77.a]
32. 11
“I manifest terrifying wrathful bodies like rākṣasas, eating flesh and
drinking blood, to those who are possessed by anger, who are proud,
arrogant, conceited, and haughty, and who are to be guided through


---

destruction, pacifying all who are agitated by pride and arrogance.1278
32. 12
“I manifest the danger of being harmed by fire, water, kings, and thieves
for beings who are lazy and abandon diligence, causing them to be
distressed and become diligent.
32. 13
“In that way, through those methods, I turn them away from that which is
not virtuous and establish them in a perfection of virtue so that they may
defeat all that is adverse to the perfections, gather all the accumulations of
the perfections, transcend all the paths of the mountain precipices of
obscurations, and enter the unobscured Dharma.
32. 14
“Noble one, I know only the bodhisattva liberation called the net of clouds.
How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of bodhisattvas
who are like Indra defeating the asuras of the kleśas, who are like water
extinguishing the mass of fire of the suffering of all beings, who are like a
mass of flames drying up the water of the cravings of all beings, who are like
a wind scattering the mountain of all clinging to attachment, and who are
like thunderbolts shattering the hard rock of the perception of a self?
1279
32. 15
“Depart, noble one. In this Jambudvīpa, in the land of Magadha, at the
bodhimaṇḍa, there is the goddess of the earth who is named Sthāvarā. Go to
her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ” [F.77.b]
32. 16
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
deva Mahādeva, circumambulated the deva Mahādeva many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from the deva Mahādeva.
