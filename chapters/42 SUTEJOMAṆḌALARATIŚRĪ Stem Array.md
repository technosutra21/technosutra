Chapter 42
SUTEJOMAṆḌALA RATI ŚRĪ
42. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembering the instruction of the
night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā and meditating on,
comprehending, and augmenting the bodhisattva liberation called the origin
of the roots of merit that inspire the ripening of all beings, eventually arrived at the
Lumbinī Forest.
42. 2
He circumambulated the Lumbinī Forest, keeping it to his right, and then
searched for Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest goddess.
42. 3
He saw Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest goddess, in the Lumbinī
Forest inside a kūṭāgāra made by the encircling of all branches of trees made
of all precious materials. She was seated upon a precious lion throne with a
lotus in its center and accompanied by an assembly of two hundred
thousand trillion forest goddesses, seated before her and to whom she
taught the Dharma. [F.202.a] She was teaching them a sūtra called The
Teaching of the Ocean of Lifetimes of All Bodhisattvas. She was increasing the
power of the ocean of qualities of bodhisattvas who had been born into the
family of the tathāgatas.
42. 4
He approached the Lumbinī Forest goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, bowed
down to the feet of the Lumbinī Forest goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, and,
standing before her with palms together, said, “Āryā, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
bodhisattvas are born into the tathāgata family and how in practicing
bodhisattva conduct they bring light to beings.”
42. 5
The Lumbinī Forest goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī said, “Noble one, if the
bodhisattvas possess these ten kinds of birth, they are born into the family of
the tathāgatas. The bodhisattvas who originate from them in every instant of
mind increase the roots of merit of a bodhisattva, are unimpeded, are not
disheartened, do not regress, are not interrupted, are not dismayed, are not
discouraged, do not deteriorate, do not become confused, do not become

downcast, and do not come to ruin. They follow the direction of omniscience,
[F.202.b] they are dedicated
 to the ways of the realm of the Dharma, they
attain ripening for the enlightenment of buddhahood, they have a vast
development of the bodhisattva’s aspiration for enlightenment, they
increase all the perfections, they turn away from all worldly existences, they
accomplish the level of the tathāgatas, they purify the higher cognition of
knowledge, they directly perceive the qualities of buddhahood, and they
possess the meaning of the range of omniscience.

42. 11
“Noble one, what is the first birth of a bodhisattva, called the essence of
dedication to the prayer to serve all buddhas? It is when the bodhisattva first

Then at that time, the Lumbinī Forest goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, in
order to elucidate the meaning of this bodhisattva Dharma, through the
blessing of the Buddha gazed into the ten directions and then recited these
verses to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
42. 43
“Those who, with stainless, unalloyed higher motivation,
Never have enough of gazing upon the jinas,
The wise ones who pray for all-pervading clouds
Of displays for all the jinas, are in their first birth.
 {1}
1713
42. 44
“Those who pervade, without exception, all worlds, realms,
Beings,
 and also the Dharma and buddhas in the three times,
1714
Whose minds are adorned by the prayer to liberate beings —
They are in their inconceivable second birth. {2}
42. 45
“Those who never have enough of drinking the clouds of the Dharma,
Who have unimpeded bodies in the three times, and minds with definitive
realization,
Who have mental bodies that are as stainless as the realm of space —
They are in this third birth that is unequaled. {3}
42. 46
“Those who with a higher motivation, like Sumeru, as firm
 as a vajra,
1715
Are entering the ocean of the ways of omniscience,
Who enter into the ocean of great compassion —
They, supreme among humans, are in their fourth birth. {4}
42. 47
“They who pervade the ten directions
 with love, [F.208.a]
1716

Who accomplish an ocean of stainless perfections,
Who radiate the light of the Dharma and ripen beings —
They are in the fifth birth of great beings. {5}
42. 48
“They who having realized the nature of phenomena have unimpeded
minds,
Who are born into the family of the buddhas unequaled in the three times,
Who enter into the ocean of the ways of the realm of the Dharma —
They are in this sixth birth of those who have wisdom. {6}
42. 49
“Those who have a completely pure Dharma body and an unimpeded mind,
Who with their own bodies pervade all realms without exception,
Who have gained the realization of all the strengths, without exception, of
the buddhas —
They are in the inconceivable seventh birth of the wise ones. {7}
42. 50
“Those who have dominion over the ways of an ocean of knowledge,
Who analyze the ways of the entrances into omniscience,
Who enter into an ocean of the ways of all samādhis —
They are in the eighth birth of those who rely on the true nature. {8}

Who are dedicated to ripening and guiding all beings
And manifest the display of the miracles of the buddhas —

42. 53
“Noble one, a bodhisattva is born into the family of the tathāgatas through
those ten births. In that way, the bodhisattva illuminates all worlds.
42. 54
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation [F.208.b] called the
miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of
countless kalpas.”
42. 55
Sudhana said, “Āryā, what is the scope of this bodhisattva liberation
called the miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the
perceptions of countless kalpas?”
She answered, “Noble one, I fulfilled the prayer to see and approach the
births of all bodhisattvas.

42. 56
“Noble one, I have comprehended the vast ocean of births of the Bhagavat
Vairocana. Thus, I have observed his births as bodhisattvas in this world
realm of a thousand million worlds. Because of my past prayer, I have been
born in the Lumbinī Forest of Jambudvīpa, one of the four continents, in
order to see the appearance of bodhisattvas. Now I am dwelling here,
remembering and meditating on the births of bodhisattvas. In that way, I
remain here. After I had been dwelling here for a hundred years, the
Bhagavat transmigrated from Tuṣita. At that time, there were ten omens that
appeared in the Lumbinī Forest. What were those ten? The first omen was
that in this Lumbinī Forest everywhere became level without ravines or cliffs
or high ground and low ground. The second omen was that throughout this
Lumbinī Forest the ground became made of diamond, was free of pebbles,
gravel, pieces of wood, and thorns, and was filled with many jewels. The
third omen was that this entire Lumbinī Forest became a place thick with
rows of precious trees, sal trees, and palm trees. The fourth omen was that
this entire Lumbinī Forest became a place in which grew aromatic seedlings
that were superior to divine matter, [F.209.a] in which appeared a treasure of
all powders, in which arose clouds and mists of all banners, and which was
adorned on every side by tree trunks formed of aromatic precious materials.
The fifth omen was that this entire Lumbinī Forest became a place where
there appeared, spreading everywhere, a treasury of
 various flowers,
garlands, and ornaments made of divine materials. The sixth omen was that
throughout this Lumbinī Forest all the trees became treasures of excellent
precious jewels. The seventh omen was that in all the lotus beds throughout
this Lumbinī Forest, all the flowers that grew from water blossomed, rose up
out of the ground, and floated above the water. The eighth omen was that all
the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas,
lords of the world, and lords of beings in this world’s desire realms and form
realm gathered with their palms together in homage in this Lumbinī Forest.
The ninth omen was that all the female devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas,
asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas in this world realm of
Jambudvīpa
 gathered in this Lumbinī Forest joyfully, holding every kind
of offering in their hands, [F.209.b] gazing at the branches of the pippala tree,
bowing down, and paying homage. The tenth omen was that many light
rays called the lamps of the miraculous birth of the bodhisattva shone from the
circle of the navels on the bodies of all the tathāgatas in the ten directions,
and they illuminated and remained in this Lumbinī Forest. And all the
qualities of the bodhisattvas, including their miraculous births, were heard
emanating, with the sound of a buddha’s speech, from the circular tips of
those light rays.”

42. 57
“Those are the ten omens that appeared when the time came for the birth
of the bodhisattvas. When they appeared, all the lords of the world knew, ‘a
bodhisattva is going to be born.’
“Noble one, in that way they gained an inconceivably powerful joy on
seeing those ten omens.
42. 58
“Moreover, noble one, when Māyādevī came from the great city of
Kapilavastu, ten great illuminating omens appeared in this Lumbinī Forest.
When they appeared, they increased within countless beings the power of
joy in the light of the Dharma of omniscience.
42. 59
“What were those ten? (1) All of the precious kūṭāgāras upon the surface
of the earth shone. (2) All the classes of aromatic flowers shone.
 (3) Light
shone from all the petals of blossomed precious lotuses, and they emitted the
sweet-sounding words: ‘The excellent birth has come to be.’ [F.210.a] (4) The
illumination from all the first aspirations to enlightenment by bodhisattvas in
the ten directions appeared in and illuminated this Lumbinī Forest. (5) The
miraculous manifestation of illumination from the bodhisattvas ascending all
the bhūmis appeared in and illuminated this Lumbinī Forest. (6) All the
illumination from the light of the accomplishment of all the perfections and
the realization of knowledge by the bodhisattvas in the ten directions
appeared in and illuminated this Lumbinī Forest. (7) All the illumination
from the knowledge of the bodhisattvas in the ten directions that has power
over all prayers appeared in this Lumbinī Forest. (8) All the illumination from
the knowledge of the bodhisattvas in the ten directions that accomplishes
their vast prayers appeared in this Lumbinī Forest. (9) All the illumination
from the knowledge of the bodhisattvas in the ten directions that ripens and
guides beings appeared in this Lumbinī Forest. (10) All the illumination from
the knowledge of the bodhisattvas in the ten directions that comprehends
the miracles of all the buddhas, their setting forth, and their enlightenment at
buddhahood appeared in this Lumbinī Forest. Those ten great illuminating
omens appeared. [F.210.b] They illuminated the darkness of mind and
thoughts in a vast number of beings without end or middle.
1719
42. 60
“Noble one, when Māyādevī came to the pippala tree, all the gathered
assemblies of the lords of the world, the devas of the desire realms with
groups of apsarases and retinues of deva maidens, all the assembled devas
of the form realms, who were free of odors, and the gatherings of nāgas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, and their
retinues who were engaged in making offerings to the bodhisattvas had
their bodies and their assembled offerings illuminated by Māyādevī’s
brilliance, splendor, color, and form. All the lights that were in this world
realm of a thousand million worlds were outshone and eclipsed. No other
lights could affect, obscure, prevent, or impede the light and radiance that


---

was emitted from all Māyādevī’s pores. They filled all the directions and
ended all the suffering of beings in the hells, all the suffering of beings in
birth as an animal, all the suffering in the world of Yama, and all the
suffering and kleśas of all beings within the various states of existence, and
they remained illuminating, shining, and brilliant.
42. 61
“Noble one, that was the first miraculous manifestation at the birth of the
bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 62
“Moreover, noble one, at that time, there appeared situated within
Māyādevī’s body
 the visual images of this world realm of a thousand
million worlds. [F.211.a] Within that world realm of a thousand million
worlds, in all the Jambudvīpas in its thousand million four-continent worlds,
in kingdoms with various names, in forests with various names, Māyādevī
went to the foot of various kinds of trees, where she was encircled by all the
lords of the worlds, waiting in preparation for the birth of the bodhisattva.
This was through the inconceivable miraculous manifestation of the wisdom
of the bodhisattva’s mother.
1720
42. 63
“Noble one, that was the second miraculous manifestation at the birth of
the bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 64
“Moreover, noble one, there appeared within each opening of all
Māyādevī’s pores all the tathāgatas that in the past were honored,
worshiped, venerated, and offered to by the Bhagavat during his practice of
bodhisattva conduct. All the Dharma that those tathāgatas were teaching
could be heard sounding from each pore with the aspects of a buddha’s
speech. It was like how the reflection of the display in the domain of the sky
of the sun, moon, planets, and stars, and of clouds emitting the deep sound
of thunder, appear in a small bowl of water, or a particle of gold, or the bright
surface of a mirror, or on very clear water.
42. 65
“Noble one, in that way, the miraculous manifestations of the past
tathāgatas appeared and the sound of all their Dharma teachings sounded
within the openings of all Māyādevī’s pores.
42. 66
“Noble one, that was the third miraculous manifestation at the birth of the
bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest. [F.211.b]
42. 67
“Moreover, noble one, from Māyādevī’s entire body and from each
opening of all her pores appeared all the realms, the entire ocean of world
realms, the entire vast extent of world realms, the entire multitude of world
realms, and all that are called world realms in which the Bhagavat practiced
bodhisattva conduct in the past. There appeared the surface of the realms;
their shapes; their arrangement; their bulks; their adorning mountains; their
adorning villages, towns, regions, lands, and cities; their adorning parks,
rivers,
 lakes, ponds, and seas; their adorning skies and clouds; their
abodes of beings; the yānas that were taught there; the numbers and names

of their kalpas; their births of buddhas; their perfect purities; the lifespans of
beings; their rebirths into worlds; the communities of beings; the
dependence on kalyāṇamitras; the dedication to virtuous qualities; the
engagement in the practice of the Dharma; and the practice of bodhisattva
conduct in buddha realms. In all the pores there appeared all the Bhagavat’s
attainment of the state of irreversibility, his previous bodies, [F.212.a] his
conduct, his appearance, what possessions he had, what happiness and
unhappiness he experienced, and his lifespans. There appeared in all the
pores of Māyādevī’s body images of the various births in all those buddha
realms, Māyādevī as the mothers of the bodhisattvas, and all those bodies of
the bodhisattvas.
42. 68
“Noble one, that was the fourth miraculous manifestation at the birth of
the bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 69
“Moreover, noble one, there appeared in all the pores of Māyādevī’s body
images of the past bodies in which the Bhagavat practiced bodhisattva
conduct, their colors, their shapes, their appearances, their forms, their
possessions, their happiness and sufferings, and their lifespans.
42. 70
“Noble one, that was the fifth miraculous manifestation at the birth of the
bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 71
“Moreover, noble one, there appeared in all the pores of Māyādevī’s body
images of when the Bhagavat was practicing bodhisattva conduct in the past
and gave away that which was difficult to give. He gave away his legs and
arms. He gave away his ears and nose. He gave away his tongue and teeth.
He gave away his eyes and head. He gave away his flesh and blood. He
gave away his bones and marrow. He gave away his kidneys and heart.
[F.212.b] He gave away his skin and subcutaneous tissue. He gave away all
his outer and inner things. He gave away his sons, daughters, and wives. He
gave away his body. He gave away his precious possessions. He gave away
his villages and towns. He gave away his regions and realms. He gave away
his royal capital. He gave away his wealth, grain, treasures, and storehouses.
He gave away his jewels, pearls, beryls, conches, crystals, corals, gold, and
silver. He gave away his various precious adornments. He gave away his
beds and seats. He gave away his houses and palaces. He gave away all his
possessions. There appeared the physical forms of the bodhisattva and the
way in which he gave, the appearance of those who acquired what he gave
away, the appearance of the things that he gave away, the places where he
gave them away, and all who were at that time in the entourage of the
bodhisattva.
42. 72
“Noble one, that was the sixth miraculous manifestation at the birth of the
bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.


---

42. 73
“Moreover, noble one, when it was time for the succession of tathāgatas in
the past to be born from their mother’s body, there appeared all the arrays
and adornments of buddha realms; the arrays of adorning beings; the arrays
of adorning trees; the arrays of flowers, perfumes, incenses, garlands,
ointments, powders, clothing, banners, and flags; [F.213.a] the various
miraculous manifestations of arrays of all precious jewels; and music, song,
praises, and the sound of musical instruments. When Māyādevī came to the
Lumbinī Forest, all of those arose, appeared, and were perceived by beings
in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 74
“Noble one, that was the seventh miraculous manifestation at the birth of
the bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 75
“Moreover, noble one, all that is enjoyed by bodhisattvas, which are the
enjoyment of kūṭāgāras made of all kings of jewels, the enjoyment of divine
palaces made of kings of jewels, the enjoyment of nets of kings of jewels, the
enjoyment of objects made of kings of jewels, the enjoyment of statues made
of kings of jewels, the enjoyment of displays of kings of jewels, the
enjoyment of all adornments,
 the enjoyment of all kings of perfume, the
enjoyment of all perceptions that are beautiful and pleasing, which
transcend the enjoyment of the displays in the residences of all lords of
devas and transcend the enjoyment of the displays in the residences of all
nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, and lords
of humans, were all emanated, unmixed with one another, from the womb of
Māyādevī and were present and arrayed everywhere in the Lumbinī Forest.
1722
42. 76
“Noble one, that was the eighth miraculous manifestation at the birth of
the bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 77
“Moreover, noble one, from the body of Māyādevī emanated bodhisattvas,
as numerous as the atoms in countless quintillions of buddha realms,
[F.213.b] who had the same body, color, and shape as the Bhagavat
Vairocana, the same adornment of the signs and features of a great being,
the same aura, the same radiating of light rays, the same way of moving, the
same prowess, the same illuminating miraculous manifestations, the same
following, and the same displays, and they praised and resembled the ocean
of Bhagavat Vairocana’s excellences.
42. 78
“Noble one, that was the ninth miraculous manifestation at the birth of the
bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 79
“Moreover, noble one, the time having come for the birth of the
bodhisattva, in front of Māyādevī there rose up from the vajra ground below,
breaking through the great earth, a great lotus made of the kings of jewels
called an essence that is a display of all jewels. Its essence
 comprised the king
of jewels, the great indestructible vajra.
 All kings of jewels adorned the
tips of its filaments.
 It was adorned by rows of circles of petals as
1723
1724
1725


---

numerous as the atoms in ten buddha realms. Its surrounding leaves were
made of various kings of jewels. Its beautiful
 pericarp was composed of
pure wish-fulfilling
 jewels. It had an array of circles of filaments that had
the countless colors of all jewels. An adorning net of countless precious
kings of jewels enveloped it. It was covered by a mass of indestructible,
powerful, vajra kings of jewels.
1726
1727
42. 80
“All the lords
 of the devas encircled it. All the lords of the nāgas sent
down rain from clouds of scented water. All the lords of the yakṣas
encircling it cast down handfuls of divine flowers. [F.214.a] All the lords of
the gandharvas sang clouds of praises to it that had a beautiful sound of
melodious songs that had honored the buddhas of the past. All the lords of
asuras, forsaking all pride, arrogance, and haughtiness, bowed down and
paid homage. All the lords of the garuḍas hung
 precious cloths that
adorned the entire sky.
 All the lords of the kinnaras gazed upon it while
engaged in describing with delight the qualities of bodhisattvas with song
and music. All the lords of the mahoragas, gazing upon it with great joy and
faith, were engaged in emitting beautiful sounds and sending down rain
from clouds of every kind of display.
1728
1729
1730
42. 81
“Noble one, that was the tenth miraculous manifestation at the birth of the
bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 82
“Noble one, those ten miraculous manifestations at the time of the
bodhisattva’s birth occurred in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 83
“After that, the bodhisattva, who possessed inconceivable, measureless
light that could not be looked at, was born from Māyādevī’s womb, like the
disk of the sun from the surface of the sky, like lightning flashing from
clouds, like the dawn clouds rising from behind a mountain peak, like a great
lamp from a deep darkness.
42. 84
“In that way, the bodhisattva emerged from the body of Māyādevī,
manifesting in the nature of reflection, manifesting in the nature of a dream,
manifesting in the nature of perceiving a form that is a conjured illusion,
having the nature of being without coming or going, [F.214.b] having the
nature of a manifestation of the perception of a light that has no birth or
cessation.
42. 85
“Noble one, in that way, while residing in this Lumbinī Forest, I see and
comprehend the ocean of the miraculous manifestations at the birth
 of
the Bhagavat Vairocana.
1731
42. 86
“And, noble one, just as I see and comprehend the ocean of the miraculous
manifestations at the birth
 of the Bhagavat Vairocana in this four-
continent world, in that same way I see and comprehend a thousand million
1732


---

miraculous manifestations at the birth of the Bhagavat Vairocana in the
thousand million Jambudvīpas in all the four-continent worlds in this world
realm of a thousand million worlds.
42. 87
“Just as I see and comprehend the miraculous manifestations of the birth
of the Bhagavat Vairocana in a thousand million Jambudvīpas in all the four-
continent worlds in this world realm of a thousand million worlds, in the
same way, I comprehend the miraculous manifestations at the birth of the
Bhagavat Vairocana that are as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm
with each instant of mind, with the penetration of the mind, in all the atoms
contained within an entire world realm of a thousand million worlds, known
by the knowledge that enters into the atoms of all buddha realms.
42. 88
“In the next mentation, I see and comprehend equally the miraculous
manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas within each of the buddha realms
contained within the atoms of a buddha realm.
42. 89
“In that way, although I see and comprehend the miraculous
manifestations at the births of bodhisattvas in each of the buddha realms
contained within the atoms of all buddha realms, [F.215.a] there is no
knowable end to the succession of realms in each one of all the atoms, and
there is no knowable end to the succession of births of bodhisattvas in each
one of all the realms.
42. 90
“Just as I see and comprehend all the miraculous manifestations at the
birth of bodhisattvas in this world realm, in the same way, in each instant of
mind, with the penetration of the mind, through continuous spiritual power,
I see and comprehend all the miraculous manifestations at the births of
bodhisattvas in all the vast extent of world realms, without end or middle, in
the ten directions and in all atoms.”
42. 91
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, asked Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the
Lumbinī Forest goddess, “Āryā, how long has it been since you attained this
bodhisattva liberation called the miraculous manifestations at the birth of
bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of countless kalpas?”
42. 92
She answered, “Noble one, in the past, in times gone by, beyond as many
kalpas as there are atoms in ten million buddha realms, and even further
beyond, there was a world realm called Samanta ratnā in a kalpa called
Samāpadyata in which appeared eighty quintillion buddhas. There appeared
in that world the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Īśvara guṇāparājita-
dhvaja, who was one with wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who
knows the world’s beings, an unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a
teacher of devas and humans, [F.215.b] a buddha, and a bhagavat.
1733
42. 93
“Noble one, at the center of the world realm called Samanta ratnā, there
was a four-continent world called Vicitra vyūha prabhā. In the middle of the
Jambudvīpa of that four-continent world there was a royal capital called


---

Meru viśuddha vyūha dhvajā. In that royal capital there was King Ratnārci-
netra prabha. King Ratnārci netra prabha had a queen called Suharṣita-
prabheśvarā.
42. 94
“Noble one, just as Māyādevī became the mother of the Bhagavat
Vairocana in this four-continent world, at that time, in that time, Queen
Suharṣita prabheśvarā became the mother of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata
Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja, in the four-continent world called Vicitra vyūha-
prabhā. He was the first of the eighty quintillion buddhas. She was the
mother of the first bhagavat to appear, the Tathāgata Īśvara guṇāparājita-
dhvaja.
42. 95
“Noble one, when the time had come for the birth of the bodhisattva,
Queen
 Suharṣita prabheśvarā, together with two hundred thousand
trillion women, went to the great park called Suvarṇa puṣpābha maṇḍala.
Prince Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja was born there with the inconceivable
miraculous manifestations that occur at the birth of a bodhisattva.
1734
42. 96
“At that time, there appeared in the center of the great park called
Suvarṇa puṣpābha maṇḍala a kūṭāgāra called Subha ratna vicitra kūṭa. [F.216.a]
The Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja was born from
Queen Suharṣita prabheśvarā as she held on to a branch of a wish-fulfilling
tree inside that kūṭāgāra.
42. 97
“At that time, when the Bhagavat was born, the nurse Vimala saṃbhava-
prabhā was in attendance. As soon as the bodhisattva was born, the lords of
the world sprinkled him with a vase of scented water that was wonderfully
aromatic and with a variety of beautiful flowers so as to cool his body. They
made countless inconceivable, supreme appropriate offerings to him and
placed him on the nurse Vimala saṃbhava prabhā’s lap. The instant that she
took the bodhisattva onto her lap, the nurse attained great powerful joy and
faith and attained the bodhisattva samādhi called all-seeing. As soon as she
attained that, she saw the countless tathāgatas present within the world
realms in the ten directions. She entered in a subtle way this bodhisattva
liberation called the miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas
throughout all the perceptions of countless kalpas. This was like the moment when
a consciousness enters a womb. Through attaining that liberation, she made
the great prayer to see the miraculous manifestations at the births of all
tathāgatas.
42. 98
“Noble one, what do you think? [F.216.b] If you think that the
bodhisattva’s nurse, Vimala saṃbhava prabhā, at that time, in that time, was
anyone else, do not see her in that way. I was at that time, in that time, the
bodhisattva’s nurse, Vimala saṃbhava prabhā.


---

42. 99
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that the two hundred
thousand trillion women at that time, in that time, were anyone else, do not
see them in that way. They are these two hundred thousand trillion
goddesses who now dwell in the Lumbinī Forest and are my entourage.
42. 100
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that Queen Suharṣita-
prabheśvarā, the mother of the Tathāgata Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja, at that
time, in that time, was anyone else, do not see her in that way. This
Māyādevī was at that time, in that time, the queen named Suharṣita-
prabheśvarā.
42. 101
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that King Ratnārci netra-
prabha at that time, in that time, was anyone else, do not see him in that way.
King Śuddhodana was at that time, in that time, the king named Ratnārci-
netra prabha.
42. 102
“Noble one, since that time, in every instant I have never been apart from
seeing and comprehending the ocean of miraculous manifestations at the
bodhisattva births of the Bhagavat Vairocana or from seeing and
comprehending the ocean of the miraculous manifestations of his supremacy
in guiding beings.
42. 103
“Noble one, in every moment of mind, with eyes of knowledge that
encompass all atoms, I see and comprehend within all atoms in this world
realm of Sahā an ocean of the buddha realms of the tathāgatas, which have
appeared from the vast extent of the ocean of prayers made by the Bhagavat
Vairocana. [F.217.a] I see and comprehend the ocean of the tathāgatas that
are in those buddha realms. I also see and comprehend the great ocean of
the miraculous manifestations at the bodhisattva births of those tathāgatas.
42. 104
“In the same way, in every instant of mind I see and comprehend the
entire ocean of the miraculous manifestations of the supremacy of guiding
beings and the ocean of the miraculous manifestations at the bodhisattva
births of all tathāgatas in the ten directions.
42. 105
“I 
perceive 
without 
error 
the 
births 
of 
bodhisattvas 
through
comprehending the succession of the entire vast extent of atoms in this
world realm of a thousand million worlds, and I comprehend the qualities of
the buddhas. In the same way, I comprehend the entire ocean of realms
contained within the entire vast extent of the atoms in countless tens of
thousands of quintillions of buddha realms in the ten directions, and I
comprehend the vast ocean of buddhas within them. I also see the
perception of the miraculous manifestations at the bodhisattva births of
those buddha bhagavats. I make offerings to them when they become
tathāgatas. I hear the teachings that those tathāgatas give. I practice the
correct Dharma of their Dharma.”


---

42. 106
Then at that time, Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the goddess of the Lumbinī Forest,
[F.217.b] in order to teach clearly the bodhisattva liberation called the
miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of
countless kalpas, through the blessing of the Buddha, gazed into the ten
directions and recited these verses:
42. 107
“Son of the jinas,
 you have shown respect
1735
And have asked a question, so listen to what I have to say.
The field of activity of the jinas is a peace that is hard to see
And which is manifested through the ways of causes and conditions. {1}
42. 108
“I remember as many countless kalpas ago
As there are atoms in ten million realms,
There was a kalpa that had the name Samāpadyata,1736
In which there were eight hundred million
 jinas. {2}
1737
42. 109
“The first of the kalpa’s tathāgatas to appear
Was Īśvarājita guṇa dhvaja.
I saw the birth of that lord of beings
In the supreme forest Svarṇa puṣpa prabhava. {3}
42. 110
“I was his wise nurse,
Vimala saṃbhava prabhā.
As soon as he was born, there was a supreme golden light,
And the lords of the world placed him on my lap. {4}
42. 111
“When the supreme individual was placed on my lap,
I could not see the top of his inconceivable head.
Though I looked from the right and the left,
I was not able to see where it ended. {5}
42. 112
“He was adorned with the excellent physical signs,
And his body was stainless and beautiful.
He was as if made of jewels, and when I saw him
An unparalleled powerful joy increased within me. {6}
42. 113
“As I contemplated his measureless qualities,
The ocean of my merit increased.
When I saw the ocean of his miraculous manifestations,
A vast aspiration for enlightenment arose within me. {7}
42. 114
“With joy and faith in the Jina’s ocean of excellences, [F.218.a]
I gave rise to an ocean of prayers.
The vast extent of all realms was purified,


---

And all paths to lower existences were averted. {8}
42. 115
“I made an ocean of prayers that I would make
Countless offerings to future sugatas
Throughout the vast extent of realms
And liberate beings from suffering. {9}
42. 116
“I heard the Dharma from that lord
And attained the field of this liberation.
For kalpas as numerous as atoms in ten million realms,
I practiced and purified bodhisattva conduct. {10}
42. 117
“I have made offerings to however many lords
Have appeared without exception.
I became a holder of their teachings,
And I purified the ocean of this liberation. {11}
42. 118
“I became a holder of the Dharma wheel
Of all the past possessors of the ten strengths,
As numerous as the atoms in ten million realms,
And I have meditated on the field of this liberation. {12}
42. 119
“I see all the vast extent of the surfaces of atoms,
As many atoms as there are in the buddha realms.
In each atom I see the ocean of realms
That have been purified in the past by the jinas. {13}
42. 120
“In all that vast extent of realms,
The lords from their one mind
Manifest countless miracles,
And I see their births in supreme forests. {14}
42. 121
“There are certain jinas in certain realms
Intending to attain supreme enlightenment,
Who though they are residing in the world of Tuṣita
Manifest within an ocean of realms. {15}
42. 122
“In countless tens of millions of realms,
I see this vast extent of their births.
I see the lords teaching the Dharma
While in the center of an assembly of youths. {16} [F.218.b]
42. 123
“I see in each instant of mind those heroes
Who are as numerous as the atoms in ten million realms
Leaving home and going to the foot of the king of trees


---

And manifesting the vast field of activity of a buddha.
 {17}
1738
42. 124
“They manifest inconceivable numbers of this and that realm,
Which are as numerous as the atoms in a realm.
I see the supreme humans attaining buddhahood
And liberating beings in various existences from suffering.1739
42. 125
“They turn the unceasing, self-originated,
Supreme wheel of the surface of each atom.
Their voices have an unceasing ocean of speech.
I see them sending down rain from clouds of Dharma.1740
42. 126
“In each instant they manifest passing into nirvāṇa
In many different forms for all beings.
I see, in
 a single atom of a realm, buddhas
1741
As numerous as the atoms in ten million realms.1742
42. 127
“Looking at one atom, I see an ocean of realms
And all the jinas who appear in them.
In many hundred billion
 bodies in my lifetimes,
1743
I have gone to make offerings to them. {18}
42. 128
“There are all the endless existences of beings
In the inconceivable ways of the ocean of realms.
I come before them all and send down
A rain from the vast clouds of the Dharma. {19}
42. 129
“Son of the jinas, I know this inconceivable
Supreme field of liberation,
But I could not teach it all
In countless quintillions of kalpas. {20}
42. 130
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the miraculous
manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of countless
kalpas. How could I describe the qualities or know the conduct of
bodhisattvas who in each instant of mind have the motivation to appear in
all kalpas from the wombs they have entered; who manifest births that have
the definitive understanding of all the ways of the Dharma; [F.219.a] who
have the aspiration that gives rise to prayers to make offerings to all the
tathāgatas; who are dedicated to attaining the complete realization of all the
Dharma of the buddhas; who manifest like reflections within the classes and
existences of all beings; who are born from lotuses at the feet of all the
tathāgatas; who are skilled in knowing when the time has come to ripen all
beings; who manifest the miracle of taking rebirth with the intention to


---

guide all beings; who manifest clouds of miracles throughout the entire vast
extent of realms; and who appear as reflections in all the classes of births and
existences of all beings?
42. 131
“Depart, noble one. In the great city of Kapilavastu there is the Śākya
maiden called Gopā. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva
continue in saṃsāra in order to ripen beings?’ ”
42. 132
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the two feet of
Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest goddess, circumambulated
Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest goddess, many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, with palms together,
looking back at her, departed from Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest
goddess. [B14]
