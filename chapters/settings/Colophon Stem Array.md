A Multitude of Buddhas is the marvelous essence of the final, ultimate,
definitive wheel from among the three wheels of the Sugata’s teaching. It
has many other titles, such as The Mahāvaipulya Basket, The Earring, The Lotus
Adornment, and so on.
c. 3
It has seven sections:
 A Multitude of Tathāgatas,
 The Vajra Banner
Dedication,
 The Teaching of the Ten Bhūmis,
 The Teaching of Completely Good
Conduct,
 [F.362.b] The Teaching of the Birth and Appearance of the Tathāgatas,
The Transcendence of the World,
 and Stem Array.
 These are subdivided
into forty-five chapters.

According to Butön Rinpoché and others, it contains thirty-nine thousand
and thirty verses, a hundred and thirty fascicles, and an additional thirty
verses. In the Tshalpa Kangyur edition there are a hundred and fifteen
fascicles, the Denkarma edition has a hundred and twenty-seven
fascicles,
 and present-day editions have various numbers of fascicles.

This sūtra was first received from Ārya Nāgārjuna by Paṇḍita
Buddhabhadra and Paṇḍita Śikṣānanda (652–710), and they both translated
it into Chinese. It is taught that Surendrabodhi and Vairocana rakṣita became
principal editors for a Chinese translation.
c. 6
As for the lineage of the text, there is the lineage from China: The perfect
Buddha, Ārya Mañjuśrī, Lord Nāgārjuna, the two paṇḍitas mentioned above,
and Heshang Tushun. Then the lineage continued through others until Üpa


---

Sangyé Bum received it from Heshang Gying-ju. Then that lineage was
passed on through Lotsawa Chokden and has continued up to the present
time.
c. 7
The lineage from India is as follows:
It was passed from Nāgārjuna to Āryadeva, and then Mañjuśrīkīrti, and so
on, until Bari Lotsawa received it from Vajrāsana. It is taught that the lineage
then continued through Chim Tsöndrü Sengé, the great Sakya Lord,
 and
so on.

However, I have not seen any other text or history of a translation made
by any other lotsawa or paṇḍita other than those listed in the colophon to
this translation into Tibetan.
c. 9
The king of Jangsa Tham
 had a complete Kangyur made that was
based on the Tshalpa Kangyur. At the present time this is known as the
Lithang Tshalpa Kangyur (1609–14). I considered this to be a reliable source
and so have made it the basis for this edition. However, it has many
omissions, accretions, and misspellings, and therefore I have at this time
corrected it by seeking out many older editions.

c. 10
There are variant Indian texts and conflicting translations, and I have not
been able to ascertain from them a definitive single meaning or correct
words. Nevertheless, this text is nothing but a valid edition.
c. 11
There are varying translations of terms that have been left unrevised, as
there is no contradiction in meaning. For example, it has rgyan instead of bkod
pa;
 ’byam klas instead of rab ’byams;
 so so yang dag par rig pa instead of tha
dad pa yang dag par shes pa;
 thugs for dgongs pa;
 [F.363.a] nyin mtshan dang
zla ba yar kham mar kham dang instead of nyin mtshan dang yud du yan man
dang;
 and tha snyad instead of rnam par dpyod pa.

Sanskrit words have many cases and tenses, so that although the Tibetan
lotsawas and paṇḍitas, who had the eyes of the Dharma, translated their
meaning, their tenses, cases, and so on are difficult to discern. Those are the
majority of the examples of uncertainty, and there are also a few other kinds,
but they are nevertheless in accord with Tibetan grammar.
c. 13
In most texts there are many archaic words, so that the meaning of the
translation is not clear, but there is a consistency when those words are all in
archaic Tibetan. However, there appears to have occurred in later times a
strong adulteration of the text so that there is a mixture of archaic and
modern forms. There are also unreliable placements of the shad mark that
differentiates clauses, but all these have been left as they are because these
faults are few and minor. Therefore, this revision has been diligently edited
without becoming analogous to knocking down the ancient megaliths of the
southern regions.

May this remain for the entire kalpa within the circle of the Cakravāla
Mountains, as bright as the sun and moon, as the glory of the merit of
nonsectarian beings and the precious teaching of the Buddha.

This was printed in the water tiger year called dge byed (1722),
 in the
presence of Tenpa Tsering (1678–1738), the divine Dharma king who rules in
accordance with the Dharma, who has the vast, superior wealth of the ten
good actions, and who is a bodhisattva as a ruler of humans and the source
of happiness in the four regions of greater Tibet.

This was written by the attendant Gelong Tashi Wangchuk, who in the
process of revision was commanded to become its supervisor.
c. 17
Ye dharma hetu prabhavā hetun teṣān tathāgato hy avadat. Teṣāñ ca yo nirodha evaṃ
vādī mahā śramanaḥ.
(The Tathāgata has taught those causes that are the causes for the arising
of phenomena, and the great Śramaṇa, in that way, taught that which is their
cessation.)
