This depiction of Śākyamuni as a Vairocana emanation has its precedent in a
sūtra that was never translated into Tibetan but exists in Chinese translation:
the Brahma jāla sūtra. This sūtra introduces the Buddha Vairocana as the
primordial buddha who is the source of ten billion Śākyamunis who exist
simultaneously in ten billion different worlds. This sūtra should not be
confused with the Brahma jāla sūtra that exists both in the Pali canon and in the
Tibetan Kangyur (Toh 352).
See Peter Alan Roberts, trans., The Ten Bhūmis
(https://read.84000.co/translation/toh44-31.html), Toh 44-31.
There is evidence for Mahāyāna sūtras originating in northern India. In his
Genealogies of Mahāyāna Buddhism, Joseph Walser argues that the “core
portion” of The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines (Toh 12, Aṣṭa -
sāhasrikā prajñā pāramitā) was most probably written in the second half of the
first century in Mathura, which is located in present-day Uttar Pradesh. He
also offers the tentative conclusion that it was written by “a Sarvāstivādin
monk residing at Buddhadeva’s Guhavihāra outside of Maṭ.” See Walser
(2018), 242.
Osto notes that Etienne Lamotte, Edward Conze, and Nalinaksha Dutt all
regard the Mahāsāṃghika as the source of the Mahāyāna tradition. See Osto
(2008), 157, n. 5. Paul Williams argues that at least some Mahāyāna sūtras
emerged from the Mahāsāṃghika: “There can be no doubt that at least some
early Mahāyāna sūtras originated in Mahāsāṃghika circles. In the
lokottaravāda supramundane teachings we are getting very close to a teaching
well-known in Mahāyāna that the Buddha’s death was also a mere

appearance; in reality he remains out of his compassion, helping suffering
humanity, and thence the suggestion that for those who are capable of it the
highest religious goal should be not to become an Arhat but to take the
Bodhisattva vows, embarking themselves on the long path to a supreme and
totally superior Buddhahood.” See Williams (2009), 21. This view has been
contested by a number of scholars, however, including Paul Harrison, who
maintains in his “Searching for the Origins of the Mahāyāna: What Are We
Looking For?” that it is impossible to draw a clear connection between the
Mahāyāna and a single sect, maintaining instead that the Mahāyāna was a
loose set of related movements that cut across Buddhist India. For a fine
summary of scholarship concerning the origins of the Mahāyāna, see Osto
(2008), 105–16.

suggests that the Buddhāvataṃsaka is a type of text known as a Bodhisattva -
piṭaka. Urga (vol. 38, folio 362.a) has sangs rgyas phal po che zhes bya ba/ shin tu
rgyas pa chen po’i mdo las/ byang chub sems dpa’i sde snod cing / sdong pos rgyan pa
zhes bya ba, which could be translated as “the Bodhisattva piṭaka and Gaṇḍa -
vyūha from the Mahāvaipulya sūtra called the Buddhāvatamska,” although cing
grammatically should follow a verb, not a noun, and it could well be an error
for kyi nang when that is pronounced “chi nang.” This, like the
aforementioned colophon from Dunhuang, suggests that both Bodhisattva -
piṭaka and Gaṇḍa vyūha are titles for one and the same work. By contrast, the
Degé (vol. 38, folio 362.a) and Kangxi (vol. 60, folio 263.a) read shin tu rgyas pa
chen po’i mdo/ sangs rgyas phal po che zhes bya ba las/ byang chub sems dpa’i sde snod
kyi nang / sdong pos brgyan pa zhes bya ba chos kyi rnam grangs chen po las. This
could be rendered, “From the Mahāvaipulya sūtra called the
Buddhāvataṃsaka, from within the Bodhisattva piṭaka, the great Dharma
discourse called the Gaṇḍa vyūha,” meaning that the Gaṇḍa vyūha is from the
Bodhisattva piṭaka, a collection of bodhisattva teachings, and has been
included in the Buddhāvataṃsaka. In other words, the Gaṇḍa vyūha is contained
in the Bodhisattva piṭaka that is contained in the Buddhāvataṃsaka —a statement
that would not seem to make much sense.

According to the Sanskrit. There is no division into chapters in the Tibetan,
see Introduction i. 65. In Śikṣānanda’s eighty-fascicle Chinese translation
(hereafter, “the Chinese”), this is presented as the thirty-ninth sūtra in
twenty-one fascicles, from 60 to 80. Each fascicle bears the title ⼊法界品 (ru fa

fascicle 60 is entitled ⼊法界品第三⼗九之⼀ (ru fa jie pin di san shi jiu zhi yi), the

Avalokitanetra, which is absent in both the Chinese and the Tibetan, most
likely the result of a scribal omission due to the similarity of the names.
In the Sanskrit and the Chinese this is followed by “the bodhisattva
Samanta netra,” which is not present in the Tibetan.
The Sanskrit has “bodhisattva mahāsattva.” The Chinese ends all names
with “bodhisattva.”
The Sanskrit has “bodhisattva mahāsattva.”
The Sanskrit has “bodhisattva mahāsattva.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. Not present in the Tibetan,

The Chinese translation uses the term 成就 (cheng jiu), which means
“accomplished.” Sanskrit: abhiniryāta.
The Sanskrit samantabhadra bodhi sattva caryā praṇidhāna could also be
interpreted, as is similarly found in Osto, as “the prayer for the bodhisattva
conduct of Samanta bhadra,” though this would more regularly be written as
bodhi sattva samantabhadra caryā praṇidhāna.
According to the Sanskrit. The translation of the word vijñaptiṣu, which
would have been translated as rnam par rig byed, appears to have been
inadvertently omitted in the Tibetan, either from the Sanskrit manuscript it
was translated from or at an early stage in the copying of the text. The
Chinese translation has ⾄處無限 (zhi chu wu xian, “who had been to
countless places”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
inadvertently omitted “of the buddhas.”
According to the Sanskrit guṇa. The word yon tan (the translation of guṇa) is
absent in the Tibetan, and absent in the Chinese as well.
According to the Sanskrit anigṛhīta. The Tibetan translates as the vague mi
gnas pa, which could be interpreted as “not dwelling” or “unlocated.”
Similarly, the Chinese describes their manifestations as 無所依⽌ (wu suo yi
zhi, “nondwelling”) because they are in accordance with the aspirations of
beings.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan inadvertently omits
“wisdom.”
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have translated tshogs from
a manuscript in which gagaṇa (“space”) was corrupted to gaṇa (“crowd,”
“class,” “group”) so that it meant “the range of activity of the crowd of
tathāgatas.” The Chinese omits the description “that is as extensive as
space.”
According to the Tibetan sgo (“gateway”). The Chinese translation has ⾨
(men, “door”) as well. The available Sanskrit appears to have sukha (“bliss”)
in error for mukha (“door”).

Kangyurs. The others have la.

According to the Sanskrit vihāra and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to
have inadvertently omitted it.
According to the Sanskrit kāya and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
inadvertently omitted it.
According to kyis in Degé and most Kangyurs. Lithang and Choné have kyi.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have kyi in error for kyis in
all versions. The Chinese has 隨順 (sui shun, “according to”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has rgyan (“adornment”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has rgyan
(“adornment”). The Chinese translates this as “how he had practiced.”
The Tibetan has interpreted the compound as bsgrub pa dang / rnam par ’phrul
pa, meaning “attainments and miraculous manifestations.”
According to the Sanskrit dakṣina, and yon in Stok Palace, Yongle, Narthang,
and Lhasa. Other Kangyurs have yon tan (“qualities”). The Chinese
translates as 布施功德 (bu shi gong de, “the merit of generosity”).
According to the instrumental particle in most Kangyurs, including Stok
Palace, but absent in Lithang and Choné.
These three qualities (i.e., extensive as space, beyond example, and having
adornments) appear only in the Tibetan. The Sanskrit and the Chinese have
mahā karuṇāśarīra and ⼤悲為⾝ (da bei wei shen), both of which mean “the body
of great compassion,” which is absent in Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has a genitive particle that connects
this description with the following one.
The Tibetan here and elsewhere translates jagat as ’gro ba (“beings”) instead
of its meaning as “world.” The Chinese translates as “the world” to describe
the precious jewels as “the best of the world.”
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has a genitive particle that connects
this description with the following one.
According to the Sanskrit rāja and rgyal po in Stok Palace, Narthang, and
Lhasa. Other Kangyurs have rgyal ba.

of divine bodies”).
According to the Tibetan. In Sanskrit this is divided into two descriptions:
“Adorned by a rain from clouds of every flower, adorned by a profusion of a
treasure of excellent flowers.” The Chinese has 華樹 (hua shu, “flowering
trees” or “flowers and trees”).
According to the Tibetan. “Trees” is absent in the available Sanskrit. The
Chinese has ⾐樹雲 (yi shu yun, “clouds of clothes and trees”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan translates paṭala, here meaning “a
mass or assemblage,” as na bun (“mist”). The Sanskrit śarīra here has the
meaning of “world” or “universe” but was translated into Tibetan by its
more general meaning of “body,” creating a meaningless sentence. The
Chinese reads ⼀切⼤地 (yi qie da di), literally “all great lands,” which can
mean the “world” or “universe,” either singular or plural. It describes the
following clouds of incense as ⼀切如眾⽣形 (yī qiè rú zhòng shēng xíng, “in
forms of all sentient beings”). Cleary has “form of all beings” while Osto has
“body of the entire world.”
According to the Sanskrit jala and the Chinese 網 (wang). The Tibetan appears
to have translated from rāja (“king”). The word “powder” is absent in the
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit bimba. The Tibetan translates as ’bru, which could
be taken to mean “grain.” Not present in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit adhitiṣṭha. The Tibetan translates it as byin gyis brlab
pa (“blessed”). The Chinese presents all these items as part of the
manifestation without adding verbs to each.
In the Sanskrit this is followed by “manifested the circles of followers in all
buddha realms,” which is absent in the Tibetan and the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit and Tibetan later in the sūtra. At this point the
Sanskrit omits tejo, while the Tibetan omits rgyal po (rāja).
According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has bdug spos (“incense”) instead of rgyal
mtshan (“banners”). The sentence then repeats, so this is apparently an error.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan omits “flowers” and
has a second repetition of the same sentences, so this omission is apparently
an error.

According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan here is particularly corrupt and
descends into gibberish: mdangs ’byung bas thams cad kyi rdul gyi kha dog dang
’dra ba’i (“through shining with light they are like the color of dust/atoms”).
The Chinese does not mention “pores” and describes such jewels as
“brilliant.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have an
inadvertent omission of the last two syllables of its name (rgyal mtshan).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have an
inadvertent omission of “clothing.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have an
inadvertent omission of “clothing.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have an
inadvertent omission of “clothing.”
The Sanskrit has the adjective pāṇḍu (“white”).
According to the Mahāvyutpatti, the Sanskrit śilā should be translated as man
shel (“crystal”), though here it was anomalously translated as khra bo’i rdo
(“multicolored stone”), which may be why the adjective “white” in the
Sanskrit was omitted. The Chinese translates śilā as ⽩⽟ (bai yu, “white
jade”).
Lithang and Choné have sprin (“clouds”) in error for spyan (“eyes”).
Sanskrit: sarva ratna dharma dhātvabhimukha dvāra śikhara mahā maṇi ratna kūṭāgārān,
“kūṭāgāras of every precious material with gateways that looked out upon
the realm of phenomena and pinnacles of great jewels.” The Chinese is the
same as the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has two sentences,
the first including rin po che’i gos ’od ’phro ba (“light rays from precious
clothing”), and the second bdug spos sna tshogs kyis rnam par bdugs pa (“light
rays perfumed by incenses and perfumes of all kinds”). The Chinese
describes this as 香 (xiang, “incenses”) without mentioning clothing.
According to the Tibetan sems can thams cad rab tu ’dzud pa, which could also
mean “entered into all beings.” The Chinese of the Sanskrit sarva sattva -
prasthāna, according to Cleary, means that the sounds are “of the abodes of all
beings.” According to Osto it means the sounds “of all beings.” Prasthāna can
mean “to set out for” or “origin.” The Chinese describes the head adornment

as 出⼀切眾⽣發趣⾳摩尼王嚴飾冠 (chu yi qie zhong sheng fa qu yin mo ni yan shi
guan, “crowns gloriously adorned with kings of jewels that emitted the
sounds of all sentient beings”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
inadvertently omitted part of the name: rnam par snang mdzad kyi [dpal gyi
smon lam gyi] snying po.
The Tibetan uses sgra bsgrags pa throughout this passage, but the Sanskrit has
mostly pramuñcan (“emits”) and also has nigarjan (“roars”) twice.
According to the Tibetan skad and the Chinese 語⾔ (yu yan). The Sanskrit has
“mantras.”
The Sanskrit has nigarjan (“roars”).
In the Sanskrit the sentence ends with an additional description that is
absent from the Tibetan and the Chinese: “…and with their bodhisattva
bodies adorned with networks of kings of jewels that illuminated all realms.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “gifts of clothing.” The Chinese
mentions only recipients of generosity.
According to the BHS abhirocana. The meaning in Classical Sanskrit would be
“delighting.” Osto translates this from the Chinese as “illumination,” and
Cleary translates it as “pleasing.” The Tibetan mngon par mos par byed pa
would literally be “cause to have aspiration.”
According to the Sanskrit vyūha. The Tibetan translates as rgyan, and the
Chinese as 莊嚴 (zhuang yan, “adornments,” “jewelry”).
According to the Sanskrit anāyūha and the Chinese 終無所來 (zhong wu suo lai).
The Tibetan has the obscure len pa med pa.
This and the previous quality are combined in the Sanskrit and the Chinese.

inadvertently missing from the Tibetan.

According to the Tibetan mngon du ’dor ba. The Sanskrit parākrama means
“exertion,” “strength,” and so on. The Chinese translates according to the
Sanskrit as 勇健 (yong jian).
According to the BHS vijñapti, translated in Chinese as ⽰現 (shi xian). Tibetan
translates as dmyigs pa (archaic spelling of dmigs pa).
From the Tibetan grub pa. The Sanskrit nirvṛtta could mean happiness, peace,
extinction, or the state of nirvāṇa.
The order of the first and second qualities in this list is reversed in the
Sanskrit.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. “Dream-like” appears to have
been inadvertently omitted from the Tibetan.
Both epithets (i.e. agrayuga bhadrayuga; mchog gi zung, bzang po’i zung) refer to
Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana. Not mentioned in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan omits “wisdom.” The Chinese has
“eyes of wisdom.”
According to the Sanskrit vṛkaśṛgāla and the Chinese 豺狼 (chai lang). The
Tibetan translates as “wolves and foxes.”

gardens”). The Chinese is similar to the Sanskrit.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has “They had
perfected the nature and branches of omniscient wisdom.”
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan translates vidyā (“the science of
medicine”) as vidyamantra, and grahana (“the acquisition of that knowledge”)
as “the collecting of herbs.”

(“enter”).
According to the BHS niryāta. Tibetan translates literally according to the
alternative meaning of “emerge” as byung ba.
According to the Tibetan mthong and the Chinese ⾒ (jian). The Sanskrit has
prajānanti (“know”).

treasures.”
According to the Sanskrit śilpasuśikṣita. The Tibetan has (in Yongle, Kangxi,
and Choné) don rtags (“signs or proof of meaning”). Other Kangyurs such as
Degé and Stok Palace have dan in error for don.
According to the syntax of the Sanskrit. The Tibetan syntax is obscure.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit akalperyāpatha means “improper
conduct” or “improper ascetic practices.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. Omitted in the Tibetan.
According to the Tibetan lus, presumably translated from kāya. The present
available Sanskrit has kārya (“activities”), but kāya when this is repeated.
According to the Sanskrit, Chinese, and Yongle, Narthang, and Lhasa
versions of the Tibetan. Degé, Stok Palace, and other Kangyurs have sems can
(“being”) in error for sems (“mind”).
The Tibetan translates inconsistently as shes (“know”).
According to the BHS meaning of varṇa, the Pali vaṇṇa, and the Chinese 相
(xiang). The Tibetan translates according to the most common meaning of the
Sanskrit varṇa as an archaic term for color: kha dog mdog.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit is confusing, as the bodhisattvas are
plural nominative, but there is a third-person singular for the verb “does not
see.” Possibly the bodhisattvas should be in the plural accusative, in which
case the verse could mean “[The world] does not see the great gathering of
bodhisattvas / who have arrived from countless millions of realms to see the
Jina.” The Chinese uses the second-person plural.
According to the Sanskrit compound cittagocara. The Tibetan interprets it as
“mind and range.” The Chinese translates it as 境界 (xin jing jie) rather than
the usual term ⼼境界 (xin jing jie), omitting ⼼ (xin), the word for “mind,”
probably to keep the same number of words in each line of the verses.
According to the Sanskrit aparājitāḥ and the Yongle pham myed and Narthang
pham med. Other Kangyurs have the incorrect pham byed.
The order of this and the subsequent verse are reversed in the Tibetan
translation; this inverse order is preserved here. The Chinese matches the
order of the Sanskrit.

According to the BHS anirvṛta. The Tibetan translates as grub pa med pa
(“without production”). The Chinese has translated the second part of this
verse as 知無變化法, ⽽現變化事 (zhi wu bian hua fa, er xian bian hua shi, “they
know the unchanging instructions on Dharma, but manifest changing
events”).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit can be translated as “the Buddha
does not have a region.”
According to the Tibetan, presumably from deśānugaḥ. The Sanskrit can be
translated as “the Buddha does not go into a direction (diśānugaḥ).” The
Chinese translation of this verse has considerable wordplay, using the
common translation of the Sanskrit diśānugaḥ as 無量 (wu liang), which has
the connotation of being inconceivable, without any quantifiable,
measurable, or ascertainable feature, including direction and realm, contrary
to its antonym 有量 (you liang). The verse in Chinese can be understood as
“the state of enlightenment is neither 無量 nor 有量; the great Muni has gone
beyond both.”
Literally, “does not go beyond.” According to the Sanskrit, the Stok Palace,
and the Degé las. Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné have pas. The Chinese
does not have the negative.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has plural.
According to the Sanskrit instrumental and Yongle, Narthang, and Lhasa yis.
Other Kangyurs have the genitive yi. “Looking through” is implied.
There is a play on words in the Sanskrit, as varṇa has many meanings,
including “color” as well as “class,” “caste,” “nature,” “character,” and
“quality.” This play on words is lost in English and in the Tibetan. The
Chinese interprets the term as 願 (yuan, “aspirations”).
This verse is translated according to the Tibetan. The Chinese is similar to
the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit second-person plural. The Tibetan is ambiguous.
The Chinese has “the various activities of the bodhisattvas” as the subject.
According to the Sanskrit, Stok Palace, and Narthang bu’i.
According to the Sanskrit śodhana, Chinese 清淨 (qing jing), and the Stok
Palace sbyong. Other Kangyurs apparently have has spyod in error for sbyong.

According to the Sanskrit pramocana. The Tibetan has ’grel ba in error for ’grol
ba.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit vinīyante means “guided” or
“trained.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit reads saṃbuddha. The Chinese is the
same as the Sanskrit.
According to the Sanskrit suvicitra. Tibetan has bris (“written,” “drawn”) in
error for bres.
The second half of the verse is in accordance with the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit mahā. Stok Palace, Narthang, and Lhasa have chen,
which matches the Sanskrit and the Chinese ⼤ (da, “great”). Degé and others
have can; Yongle has cen.
According to the Sanskrit. Presumably for lack of room in the Tibetan verse,
“of buddhahood” is omitted. The Chinese has 無上覺 (wu shang jue,
“supreme, unsurpassable enlightenment”).
According to the Tibetan, which has two synonymous adjectives, while the
Sanskrit and the Chinese have one adjective.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has rtag par
apparently in error for brtags par (“examine” as in Stok Palace).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan reads de la sems skye med par bsam,
which appears to mean “He thinks that the mind is birthless.” The Chinese
translation appears to evolve around the word 思 (si), which functions both
as a noun and a verb, meaning “thoughts,” “to think,” “that which/who
thinks,” and so on: 智者應如是, 專思佛菩提; 此思難思議, 思之不可得 (zhi zhe
ying ru shi, zhuan si fo pu ti; ci si nan si yi, si zhi bu ke de, “The wise one should
be like this, dedicating his mind to the enlightenment of buddhahood. This
mind is inconceivable; it is not knowable or obtainable [by contemplation]”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has either misread
baddha (“bound”) as buddha or was translating from a manuscript containing
that error. The result in Tibetan is “Although the buddhas continuously
appear, the world remains fruitless.” The Chinese has 凡夫嬰妄惑，於世常流
轉 (fan fu ying chang liu zhuan, yu shi chang liu zhuan, “Ordinary beings suffer
from illusions and confusions, continuously wandering in the world”).

According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan omits jñāna vikrānta (ye shes kyis rnam
par gnon pa), which was present in the earlier version of the name. Earlier in
the Degé we find non pa rather than gnon pa.
Literally “hundreds of ten millions.”
According to the Sanskrit puṇyatīrtha (literally, “merit worthy”), a term used
for places of pilgrimage etc., translated into Tibetan obscurely as bsod nams
stegs. The Chinese has translated this line as 普⽣三世福 (pu sheng san shi fu,
“He is the universal source of merits of the three times”).
According to the Tibetan. “That brings joy when seen” is not present in the
Sanskrit or the Chinese. This perhaps derives from a variant of pradyota
(“light”) as pramudita.
Literally jinaurasāḥ (“offspring of the jinas”), translated into Tibetan as rgyal
sras, which is usually the Tibetan for jinaputra (“sons of the jinas”). The
Chinese translates it literally as 佛⼦ (fo zi, “sons of the Buddha”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have translated from a
corrupted manuscript in which akṣaya was replaced by jñāna. The Chinese
has expanded the second part of this verse into two: “gives teaching
unceasingly and widely” and “displays unimpeded discriminating
knowledge” as the second and third lines.
The Sanskrit has just the one verb udita, which is doubled in the Tibetan to
shar shing ’byung (“arisen and appeared”). This reads as byung in Yongle,
Lithang, Kangxi, Narthang, and Choné, which appears more correct for a
past passive participle. The Stok Palace version has byang, which is an error
for byung.
According to the Sanskrit vośodhanaḥ and the Tibetan sbyong in Stok Palace,
Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Choné, and Lhasa. Degé has spyod. The Chinese
interprets it this as 成就智慧⾝ (cheng jiu zhi hui shen, “has attained wisdom
body”).
According to the Tibetan ’od snang gsal ba of Stok Palace, Narthang, and
Lhasa. Other Kangyurs have ’di snang gsal ba. The Sanskrit is candrabhāsvara
(“moonlight”). The Chinese interprets this verse as, “On seeing the supreme
two-legged being, if one can develop vast motivation, they will always be
able to meet the buddhas and increase their power of wisdom.”
According to the Tibetan, which gives the same name as earlier. The Sanskrit
gives an alternate version of his name,

Dharmadhātutalabhedajñānābhijñārāja, which is the version translated into
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit śruti and the Narthang and Lhasa thos. Other
Kangyurs, including Stok Palace and Degé, have mthong (“see”). The
Chinese has expanded this verse into two contrasting scenarios: “remain in
the lower realms but always able to hear the names of the buddhas” versus
“born in higher realms but temporarily unable to hear the names of the
buddhas.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
unintended omissions resulting in “the teaching of the succession of
buddhas in the atoms of all the buddha realms…”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
misinterpreted “facing the bodhimaṇḍas” as meaning “the location of
manifesting the essence, enlightenment.” The Chinese translates as 佛坐道場
(fo zuo dao chang, “the bodhimaṇḍas where the buddhas reside”).
According to the Sanskrit arambaṇataleṣu, which the Tibetan translates as
“grounds focused on.”
According to the Sanskrit sama and the Chinese. The Tibetan has “in the
atoms of all realms.”
According to the Sanskrit jina and the Stok Palace, Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi,
Narthang, Choné, and Lhasa rgyal. Degé has rgal.
According to the Sanskrit tatra and the Stok Palace de na. Narthang and Lhasa
have ni. Degé and other Kangyurs have nas (“from”).
According to the Sanskrit syntax. In the Tibetan, “conduct” is separated from
“delightful.” In the Chinese translation, verses 6 and 7 are a continuation of
verse 5, sharing the same subject —the bodhisattvas. The equivalent of this
line appears as the first line in verse 6, 皆住普賢⾏ (jie zhu pu xian xing), which
can be understood as “all maintain excellent conduct” or “all maintain the
conduct of Samanta bhadra.”
The Tibetan translates sāgara here as the gang chen mtsho (“ocean that is big”)
as opposed to rgya mtsho elsewhere. Lithang, Choné, and Lhasa appear to
have “corrected” it to gangs chen mtsho (“ocean of great snow”). The Chinese
has 海 (hai, “ocean”).

the subject of the first line, a term that denotes the numberless bodies of
buddhas. The Chinese omits “the sugatas.”

brnan. Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné have bstan. Not present in the
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit sama and the Chinese. The Tibetan khongs su chud
pa could mean “comprised within.”
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese. Here the Tibetan is presumably
translated from a manuscript that read nāmavarṇa (“name and color”) instead
of the present Sanskrit editions that have nānābala (“various powers”). The
Chinese has “name” and “color” as two features.
According to the Sanskrit pratiṣṭhāna, the Chinese 住處 (zhu chu), and the Stok
Palace, Narthang, and Lhasa gzhi. Other Kangyur have zhing (“realms”).
According to the Sanskrit vyañjana. The Tibetan translates as yi ge (“letters”).
According to the Sanskrit, the Chinese, and the instrumental kyis in the Stok
Palace, Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Urga, and Lhasa Kangyurs. Degé has kyi.
Also, the following part of the sentence is missing in all Kangyurs. The
Chinese has “the great assemblies of bodhisattvas saw…”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. There has been an accidental
omission of most of this and the following sentence in Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. “Directions” is not present in
Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit kāya. The Tibetan is inconsistent, as in conjunction
with “beings” it translates kāya as lus (“body”). The Chinese translates
literally as “body” (⾝, shen): “bodies of all realms,” “bodies of all beings,”
omitting the word “directions.”
According to the Sanskrit saṃjñāgata. The Tibetan translates as mying
(“name”).
There is the inadvertent scribal omission of a few words here so that this and
the following direction in the list have been combined.

Chinese as 種性 (zhong xing).

apparently in terms of its meaning “waves.” Not present in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit kṣaṇasaṃbheda. Translated in the Chinese as 普知

translation from kṣaṇāsaṃbheda.

meanings, such as “control,” but not “blessing.” It was translated into
Tibetan as byin gyis rlob pa, which is regularly translated from general Tibetan

meaning, particularly within the sūtras. The Chinese reads 現⾝ (xian,
“appear,” “manifest”).
According to the Sanskrit. Vimaṇḍala is the term used for the orbit of the sun

From the Sanskrit praṭimaṇḍala. The Tibetan and the Chinese translate as
“adornment.”
According to the Sanskrit sāgara and the Chinese. Translated into Tibetan as
gang chen mtsho (“the lake that is big”) instead of the usual rgya mtsho (“vast
lake”) as in the Mahāvyutpatti, perhaps because the synonym samudra is
translated as rgya mtsho in this sentence and the translator wished to create a
synonym. This term is made more obscure in Narthang, Choné, and Lhasa,
where it is incorrectly written gangs chen mtsho (“great snow lake”).
The online Sanskrit (Vaidya) has kūṭāgara.
According to the Tibetan thams cad mkhyen pa’i chos, presumably from a
Sanskrit manuscript that had sarvajñadharma. The Chinese has ⼀切智智無上法
城 (yi qie zhi zhi wu shang fa cheng), which can mean “the towns of omniscient
supreme Dharma,” probably a confluence of two Sanskrit terms sarvajñāna
and sarvajñadharma, or “the towns of supreme Buddhadharma” or “the
supreme town of omniscient Dharma.” The present Sanskrit has just
sarvadharma (“all Dharmas”).
According to the BHS avaropita. The Chinese translation emphasizes “planted
deeply.” The Tibetan has bskyed pa (“generated”).
Aṣṭāpada (“eight feet”) was the game board that was the ancestor of checkers
and chess, and like them it consists of a board that is eight horizontal
squares and eight vertical squares in size, resulting in sixty-four squares. It
is a characteristic pattern of the ground in pure realms. In this segment, the
Chinese uses the common term for “road,” 路 (lu), instead of 道 (dao) for
“road” or “path.” The first feature of this road or path is 左右⼋步, 平坦莊嚴
(zuo you ba bu, ping tan zhuang yan, “eight steps to his right and left is flat,
even, and beautified”).
In the Sanskrit and the Chinese, “emit from their ūrṇā hairs.” “From their
ūrṇā hairs” is not present in the Tibetan. The Chinese describes how
buddhas emit light from their ūrṇā hairs when they are about to give
teachings.
From the Sanskrit nipatanti. The Tibetan translates as ’char ba, which could
mean “shine on” or even “rise from.” The Chinese translates as “shine on his
body and enter his body through the crown of his head.”

which is not present in the Tibetan or the Chinese.

byang chub sems dpa’ kun tu bzang po’i spyod pa (Yongle and Kangxi have byang
chub sems dpa’i kun tu bzang po’i spyod pa) could be interpreted as “the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s conduct.” The Chinese interprets it as
“established in the mind of bodhisattvas, firmly and unwaveringly.”
According to the Tibetan. “Activities” is not present in the Sanskrit or the
Chinese.
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese, which has 莊嚴幢娑羅樹林 (zhuang
yan chuang suo luo shu lin, “forest of sal trees and majestic banners”). The
Sanskrit has vicitra sāra dhvaja vyūha, translated by Cleary as “Array of Various
Standards of Strength,” translating sāra as “strength.”
Literally, “ten million times a hundred thousand million times a hundred
thousand times ten.” In other words, a million million million million.
From the Sanskrit śreṣṭhi. The Tibetan translates as tshong dpon (“merchant
leader”). The Chinese translation does not have an adjective here.
From the Sanskrit śreṣṭhidāraka. The Tibetan translates as tshong dpon gyi bu,
“son of a head merchant.” The Chinese translates as 童⼦ (tong zi, “youth,”
“youthful”), translating only dāraka and not śreṣṭhin.
From the Sanskrit aṅku. The Tibetan translates as sdong po, which could also
refer to a tree trunk, but that is not the intended meaning here. Also, the
Tibetan analyzes the compound sapta ratnāṅkurāḥ to mean “sprouts of seven
precious materials,” but “seven precious sprouts” matches the context here.
Based on the syntax, the Chinese has interpreted it as 七寶芽 (qi bao ya,
“sprouts made of seven precious jewels”).

From the Sanskrit gamana. The Tibetan seems to have been translated from a
manuscript that read gagana (“space”). The Chinese has “his mind is as pure
as space.”
According to the Sanskrit sarva buddhānanta. The Tibetan has, apparently in
error, “the succession of the buddhas,” which is then repeated as the next
item in the list. The Chinese has ⼀切佛次第法 (yi qie fo ci di fa), which might
be reconstructed as sarva buddhānantara.
According to the Sanskrit vyūha and the irregular Tibetan translation rgyan
that is used in the translation of this sūtra (the translations of other sūtras
use bkod pa) in Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Lhasa, and Stok Palace. Other
Kangyurs have the incorrect rgyud.
According to the Tibetan. The online Sanskrit edition (Vaidya) has nirvāṇa in
error for nirmāṇa. The Chinese has 化導法 (hua dao fa), which could mean
“methods to guide beings.”
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese. The BHS dharma deśanādhiṣṭhānaṃ
prati prasrabhya could mean “having concluded his resolve to teach the
Dharma to the beings…”
According to Tibetan analysis of the compound buddha guṇa māhātmyaṃ. This
could also be “the greatness of the qualities.” The Chinese translation omits
“greatness.”
According to the Sanskrit hitāya. The Tibetan has sman in error for phan, an
error that can occur when transcribing from dbu med script. This verse is
absent from the Chinese.
According to the Tibetan, which takes this as a vocative and places it in the
first line of verse along with “wise one.”
According to the Sanskrit sattva and the Chinese. “All” is not present in the
Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit timira and the Chinese. The Tibetan has the
inexplicable gzings pa.
From the Sanskrit udgata. The Tibetan translates according to its other
meaning of “ascending,” which does not appear to fit the context. The
Chinese translation omits “come forth to.”

From the Sanskrit praṇidhīparākramā and in agreement with the Chinese
interpretation. The Tibetan translates as “power of prayer” (smon lam gyi
mthu), which does not fit the analogy so well.
According to the Sanskrit khaṅga (the same as khaḍga) and the Chinese. The
Tibetan uses the obscure bshan and as a result was copied through listening
to its being read as spyan (“eyes”) in Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, Choné, and
Lhasa.
According to the Tibetan. The Chinese has “always attended.” The online
Vaidya edition has nirvṛta in error for nivṛta. The first two lines in the Chinese
translation have no verbs.
The Sanskrit has upanāmayāhi me (“bring me before the”).
According to the BHS pithanā-supīthita. The Tibetan translates as skyabs kyis
gcad (“block through refuge”).
According to the Sanskrit bala. Translated into Tibetan as the adjective mchog
(“supreme”), perhaps from a text that had vara instead of bala. The third line
in the Chinese reads 智眼悉遠離 (zhi yan xi yuan li, “You, the one with the
eyes of wisdom, are free from both”).
According to the Sanskrit visarada. The Tibetan here translates according to
its BHS meaning of “fearless,” which does not appear to match the context
so well. Here the Chinese translates in accord with the Tibetan, but it
translates the same phrase according to Classical Sanskrit a few verses
further on. In the Chinese, the first two lines become one; the third line
becomes 分別⼼無怯 (fen bie xin wu qie, “able to distinguish, your mind is free
from fear”).
According to the Sanskrit deśaka, the Chinese, and the Narthang and Lhasa
ston. Degé and other Kangyurs have sgron (“lamp”). The Chinese adds the
analogy that the buddhas of the three times reveal the path like the sun
arising in the world.
According to the Sanskrit visarada and the Chinese. The Tibetan here
translates according to its BHS meaning of “fearless,” which does not appear
to match the context so well.

translation 智慧決定⼈ (zhi hui jue ding ren, “the one with unchanging
wisdom”).
From saṃharāhi. The Tibetan translates bstan, which usually translates
darśayāhi (“teach” or “show”). Cleary, translating from the Chinese, has “put
me in.” In the Chinese translation of verses 20–33, the order of the first and
fourth lines is reversed, and the concluding lines of each of these verses
have the same meaning, “Carry me or enable me to travel in this vehicle!”
without any further description of the vehicle.
According to the Sanskrit rājya. Absent from the Chinese. The Tibetan
translates this simply as dam pa (“excellent”), which is the translation in the
next verse for śreṣṭha, but the entire analogy of this verse appears not to have
been understood either in translation or in its transmission.
According to the Sanskrit śayana and the Chinese. The Tibetan has lam
(“path”).
According to the Sanskrit samākula. The Chinese translation is equivalent to
“attended.” The Tibetan has rgyu (“moving”), which matches the path in the
first line, but both appear to be mistranslations.
According to the Tibetan gzer from the BHS śalya, which in Classical Sanskrit
means “lance” or “arrow.” In the Chinese translation, the third line reads 恆
塗淨戒香 (heng tu jing jie xiang, “anointed with the fragrance of pure conduct
all the time”), and the fourth line 忍辱牢莊嚴 (ren ru lao zhuang yan, “adorned
by unshakable patience”).
According to the Tibetan mthu and the Chinese. The online Vaidya has tala
(“plain” or “surface”) apparently in error for bala.
According to the Tibetan thogs med pa, which appears to have been translated
from a text that had a negation of savilambha. According to the Sanskrit and
the Chinese, this line would mean “moving slowly.” In Chinese, the first two
lines have been combined into one, while the third is divided into two: 悲⼼
作徐轉, 所向皆無怯 (bei xin zuo xu zhuan, suo xiang jie wu que, “The mind of
compassion turns slowly. It proceeds in any direction without fear”). The
adverb 徐 (xu) has the connotation of “calmly and graciously.”
In accordance with the Chinese and an assumed Sanskrit mālya. Vaidya has
mārya. The Tibetan sgyu ma (“illusion”) appears to have been translated from
a text that had māya. The Chinese translates as 善巧如幻化 (shan qiao ru huan
hua, “as skillful as magical displays”), with no mention of wisdom.

From the Sanskrit avaraṇa. The Tibetan translates it from its other meaning of
“obscuration,” which does not fit the analogy either. In fact, the Tibetan
translates with two words sgrib dang chags pa, which is reflected in this
translation. The Chinese has ⼀切無障礙 (yi qie wu zhang ai, “completely
without obstructions”).
According to the Sanskrit cakra, which has been translated into the Chinese
as “wheels.” “Circles” is omitted in the Tibetan and replaced by mang
(“many”).
According to the Sanskrit sarva. “All” is omitted in the Tibetan and the
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit gocarai. The Tibetan translates as rab snang ba, which
could be translated into English as “wisdom that illuminates every
direction.” The Chinese is similar to the Tibetan, 智慧滿⼗⽅ (zhi hui man shi
fang, “wisdom that fills [the space in all] the ten directions”).
According to the BHS viyuhāna. The Tibetan translates as klubs (“to
envelop”), which is not found in the Mahāvyutpatti, nor is viyuhāna. In the
Chinese, it is translated as a noun: 莊嚴 (zhuang yan, “splendor”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan and the Chinese omit “wind.”
According to the Sanskrit pura and the Chinese. The Tibetan has gnas
(“place”) instead of “city.” In the Chinese translation, lines two and three are
combined into one. This line becomes 定⼼安隱住 (ding xin an yin zhu, “the
mind is stable and rests in peace”), and it continues with an additional line:
普運諸含識 (pu yun zhu han shi, “transport all those with consciousness”).
According to the Sanskrit mahā mahitalācalopama, and in agreement with the
Chinese (which omits “surface”). The Tibetan here has sa chen bzhi yi stobs kyi
stobs ldan pa (“having the power of the power of four great earths”). bzhi
(“four”) is evidently an error for gzhi (“ground”).
According to the Sanskrit raśmi and the Chinese. The Tibetan omits “light
rays.”
According to vilokayi, the BHS first person optative. Translated into Tibetan
as imperative, “Show me!” The Chinese has translated the fourth line as 願能
慈顧我 (yuan neng ci gu wo, “may you look upon me with kindness!”) and has
“the Dharma king” in a separate line of verse.

According to the Sanskrit nagara. Absent in the Chinese. The Tibetan
translates as pho brang (“palace”).
According to the BHS adhyālambitavyā.
The Sanskrit adds the adjective viśuddha (“pure”).
According to the Tibetan dpal. The Sanskrit ketu can mean “brightness” or
“banner.” The Chinese has 威⼒ (wei li, “splendor,” “power,” and so on).
The Sanskrit punyākara could be translated as a multitude or plentitude of
merit or a source of merit. It is translated into Chinese as 福處 (fu chu, “source
of merit”). The Tibetan has dge (short for dge ba (“virtue”) instead of bsod nams
(“merit”) as in the Sanskrit, probably for the sake of the meter of the verse.
The Sanskrit adjective viśiddhi (“pure”) describes all four descriptions of
merit.
From the Sanskrit singular locative feminine. The Tibetan translates as dative
(“for”), as this locative frequently is used with this meaning but does not
seem to match the context here. Lines three and four are reversed in the
Chinese, which makes the fourth line, 具⾜菩薩⾏ (ju zu pu sa xing), as a result
of the third line, likely to mean “perfect the bodhisattva conduct.”
According to one of the meanings of the BHS śodhayiṣyasi, and in agreement
with the Chinese. The Tibetan translates as “purify.”
According to the BHS adhyālambitavyā.
According to the Sanskrit utsaṅga or autsaṅga and the Chinese. The Tibetan
may have translated from a text that had auṣadha as sman ljongs (“valley of
herbs”).
According to the BHS adhyālambitavyā.
According to the Tibetan rgyud. Sanskrit has pracāra (“conduct,” “activity”).
According to the Sanskrit loka kṛpā and in accordance with the Chinese. The
Tibetan snang ba’i snying rje (“the compassion of light”) is peculiar and
appears to have been translated from a text that had bodhisattvāloka kṛpā,
which would include āloka (“light”) instead of loka (“world”). The Chinese
has “manifesting the bodhisattva’s activities for the world.”
According to the Sanskrit vijñāpana. The Tibetan translates as dmigs par mdzad
pa (“focusing on,” “perceiving,” “visualizing,” “observing,” and so on).

According to the Sanskrit jagat. “Beings” is omitted in the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan omits “ten.”
From one meaning of the BHS āragaṇa. The Tibetan, with mnyes par bya ba,
translates according to the alternative meaning of “propitiate” or “please,”
which does not appear to match the context. The Chinese omits “the
accomplishment of.”
According to the Tibetan. “Resounding with their voices” is not present in
the Sanskrit and the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. “Will explain it to you” is omitted
in the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit bhūmi and the Chinese 位 (wei). “Level” is omitted
in the Tibetan.
According to the Tibetan.
From the BHS anumārjan. The Tibetan translates as rjes su sbyang ba (“trained
in”).
According to the Tibetan.
The Sanskrit āvartante means “to turn toward” in contrast to vivratante,
“turning away” from saṃsāra. The Tibetan ’grub pa is literally “accomplish”
or “attain,” which is more properly used to translate sampadyante in relation
to the family of the tathāgatas in this same paragraph, and therefore may be
translated from a manuscript that had sampadyante here instead of āvartante.
From the Tibetan rgyud. The Sanskrit srotas can also mean “river.”
The Sanskrit āvartante means “to turn toward.” The Tibetan translates as ’jug
(“enter”). The Chinese translates as 成 (cheng, “attain”).
From the Sanskrit dyotayanti … prabhavam, which could be translated as
“illuminating the majesty of.” The Chinese omits “the arising of.”
According to the Sanskrit, the Chinese, and Narthang and Lhasa: skye’o.
Other Kangyurs have skye’i, thus continuing the sentence.

According to the Sanskrit abhimukha, the Chinese 專念不捨 (zhuan nian bu she,
with the connotation of “not abandoning”) and ’dun pa in Narthang. The
other Kangyurs have ’dug.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan and the Chinese omit “to dispel
wisdom’s obscurations.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. “Deeper” is omitted in the
Tibetan.
The BHS here is kalika, which, although Monier-Williams defines it as “bud,”
is related to the Classical Sanskrit karṇika and the Pali kaṇṇika. The Daśa -
bhūmika Sūtra has the exact same kind of lotus, with a sapphire stem, gold
leaves, emerald stamens, and a sandalwood pericarp.
Throughout this passage the number is literally “ten hundred thousand.”
“Pure merit” (Sanskrit punyaśuddha) may well be a euphemism for a
particular kind of jewel.
If “radiant” (Sanskrit vairocana) is a euphemism for a particular kind of jewel,
as vairocana also means “the sun,” this could be referring to the sunstone.
The Sanskrit here is the less familiar synonym Jambudhvaja translated as 閻浮
幢 (yan fu chuang) in the Chinese. The Tibetan has ’dzam bu’i chu (“Jambu
River”).
The word for “diamond” here is vajrasiṃha (“vajra lion”); rdo rje’i seng ge in the
Tibetan, ⾦剛師⼦ (jin gang shi zi) in the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit bhāsana. The Tibetan has brjod (“describe”) in error for brjid.
The Chinese has “profundity” instead of “the majestic radiance.”
According to the Tibetan, which is in agreement with the Chinese 無⾒頂相
(wu jian ding xiang). The Sanskrit has avalokita-mūrdhita (“the visible crown of
his head”).
From the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has “bases and different aspects.” The
Chinese has “all the supreme Dharmas of the buddhas” ⼀切諸佛妙法 (yi qie
zhu fo miao fa).
From the BHS samavasaraṇa. The Tibetan interprets this as an additional verb,
gzhol ba (“descend” or “be absorbed in”). The Chinese translates samavasaraṇa
as ⼊ (ru, “enter”), and has “all Dharma wheels.”

According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan omits “in order to
communicate wisdom; they have entered the ocean of all good qualities.”
The Chinese repeats “the ocean of the minds of all beings.”
From the Sanskrit vijñapana. The Tibetan translates as rig pa (“know”). The
Chinese has 能以智慧咸悟⼊ (neng yi zhi hui xian wu ru, “communicate
wisdom and awaken all beings”).
The Sanskrit avagāhyamāna has the stronger meaning of “being immersed in.”
From the Sanskrit āvarta. The Tibetan translation has le’u dang (“chapters
and”) glong in all available editions of the Kangyur, apparently in error for
klong (“expanse,” “whirlpool”) as in the Chinese translation 漩澓 (xuan fu,
“whirlpools and undercurrents”).
This could possibly be an incorrect Sanskritization of the Middle-Indic dīpa,
which could mean both “continent” and “lamp.”
According to the Tibetan gnas. The Sanskrit patha primarily means “road” but
could also mean “region.”
According to the Tibetan. “In beautiful colors” is not present in the Sanskrit
or the Chinese.
The Sanskrit reads “human form and strength.” Yongle and Kangxi have kha
(“faces”) instead of kha dog (“color”). The male garuḍas are omitted in Cleary.
The Chinese has 童⼦形 (tong zi xing, “youthful form”).
According to the Tibetan dga’. The Sanskrit has parama (“highest”), according
with the Chinese (Cleary: “uppermost in their minds,” p. 1186).
“Nonviolence” according to the Sanskrit avihiṃsā and the Chinese 無殺⼼ (wu
sha xin, “nonkilling”), which according to the Mahāvyutpatti should be ’tshe ba
med pa in Tibetan. Yongle and Kangxi have the error bsod pa med. Choné has
rtsod pa med (“without quarrel or conflict”), while Lithang has the error brtsod
pa med.

According to the Tibetan tshul (“way,” “manner”). The Sanskrit has dhyātā

The interpretation of the relationship between the different elements of the
passage follows the Tibetan. The Vaidya punctuation interprets this
differently. In the Chinese, the verbs used are slightly differently, but the
overall meaning is very similar.
“Hour” here translates muhurta, but as there are thirty muhurta in a day, this
“hour” is forty-eight minutes long.
According to the Tibetan. Not present in the Sanskrit.

negative: “I have no impediment in my own body pervading the buddha
realms.”

alternative meaning as gzugs (“form”). The Chinese adds “clouds” to each
item.

modification. For example, “teach compassion to them and cause them to
turn away from anger.”

Chinese, light rays of gold, silver, and other precious materials and realms of
these materials are mentioned only once, and the color of light rays and the
material of realms are mostly paired differently.
This phrase is absent in Vaidya, the Chinese, and the Tibetan, but it is
present in Suzuki. Its absence is an anomaly, and therefore it has been added

features of a buddha’s body in Chinese Buddhist literature but can mean
“excellent features of a great being” in general.

the Mahāvyutpatti.
From the Sanskrit bimba and corresponding to the Chinese 寶⾝ (bao shen).
The Tibetan translates as ’bru (“syllable” or “grain”).
According to the Sanskrit citta and Degé, Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, and
Lhasa sems. Other Kangyurs have sems can (“being”). Absent from the
Chinese.
Sanskrit: eka; Tibetan: gcig.
Sanskrit: śata; Tibetan: brgya.
Sanskrit: sahasra; Tibetan: stong.
Sanskrit: śatasahasra; Tibetan: brgya phrag stong.
Sanskrit: koṭi; Tibetan: bye ba.
Sanskrit: koṭīśata; Tibetan: bye ba brgya.
Sanskrit: koṭisahasra; Tibetan: bye ba stong.
According to the Tibetan bye ba brgya phrag stong (“a hundred thousand ten
millions”). The Sanskrit koṭī śata sahasra is missing in the available edition.
Sanskrit: koṭī niyuta śata sahasra; Tibetan: bye ba khrag khrig brgya phrag stong.
According to the Mahāvyutpatti, niyuta can mean either sa ya (“a million”),
which is its value in Classical Sanskrit, or khrag khrig (“a hundred thousand
million”). The Tibetan translates here as khrag khrig, resulting in the entire
number having the value of a hundred sextillion. One expects the numbers
to be successively greater, but either value of niyuta would result in a greater
value than the next number, which is kiṃkara. However, this passage appears
to conform to the value of the bodhisattva numbers as given in chapter 15,
from this point on. There is much scribal variation in the lists in various
Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of both chapters, but in this translation there
has been an attempt to make the list consistent in both chapters 10 and 15,
where nayuta is translated as tha dgu and has the value of ten thousand
trillion trillion.
The Sanskrit is kaṅkara in Vaidya and kaṅkala in Suzuki. The Tibetan is thams
thams, its general value being a hundred nayuta in BHS (in the Abhidharmakośa
it is a thousand niyuta). However, in the Avataṃsaka it has a different value.
The Sanskrit for chapter 10 has kaṅkara in Vaidya and kaṅkala in Suzuki. In
chapter 15 it is kiṃkara. The Mahāvyutpatti dictionary has both kaṃkara and

kaṃkāra, and both are translated as gtams. The Chinese has 矜羯羅 (jin jie luo).
The usual value for kiṃkara is a hundred bimbara, but in this sūtra in chapter
15 it is the value of bimbara squared. In this chapter the order and the value of
bimbara and kiṃkara are reversed so that the value of the number is 1 followed
by 28 zeros.
In chapter 10 the value of bimbara and kaṅkara are reversed compared to
chapter 15, so that its value here is ten sextrigintillion (1 followed by 112
zeros). The more established translation of bimbara into Tibetan is dkrigs.
Chapter 15 has khrig khrig. The Tibetan here is, confusingly, khrag khrig, which
is usually the translation for nayuta. The Chinese has 頻婆羅 (pin po luo).
According to the series of numbers in chapter 15. This number appears to
have been omitted in this chapter. It is not present in chapter 10 in either
Sanskrit or Tibetan. The Tibetan is myad myid. Suzuki has magara in chapter
15. The Mahāvyutpatti dictionary has both agāra and āgāra, and both are
translated as yid yal. The Chinese is 阿伽羅 (a qie luo). The value of the number
here would be 1 followed by 224 zeros (a hundred treseptuagintillion).

Mahāvyutpatti dictionary translated pravara as both mchog yal and mchog yas.
Its value here would be 1 followed by 448 zeros (ten
cenoctoquadragintillion).
According to chapter 15 and the Mahāvyutpatti. The Tibetan has ban bun. In
chapter 10 the Sanskrit is parama. In chapter 15 the Sanskrit is mapara. The
Mahāvyutpatti dictionary has mavara, mapara, and savara, all translated as ban
bun. Its value here would be 1 followed by 896 zeros (a hundred
duocenseptennonagintillion).
The Tibetan is phyar phyur. The Sanskrit is missing in chapter 15 in the
available editions. The Mahāvyutpatti dictionary has avara as phyur phyur and
does not appear to record how it was translated in chapter 15. Therefore, it
appears that avara was missing from that chapter in the ninth-century
Sanskrit manuscript. Its value would be 1 followed by 1,792 zeros (ten
quingensexnonagintillion).
According to chapter 15. The Tibetan is lcag lcig. Neither the Sanskrit nor the
Tibetan are present in chapter 10. The Mahāvyutpatti dictionary has tavara
translated as phyad phyod. Its value would be 1 followed by 3,584 zeros (one

chu, “a place by the ocean”), probably from Samudra-vetāḍin.

for the vajra rather than the vajra’s owner. Nārāyaṇa here is ostensibly used
as an alternative name for Indra. The Chinese omits “unbreakable” and
“vajra” and translates the phrase as 寶莊嚴 (bao zhuang yan), a compound of
the adjectives “precious” and “majestic” or of the nouns “jewel” and
“ornament.”

“rows [of sandalwood trees] everywhere”).

nian), which can mean a hundred thousand years or sometimes a far higher

as “signs and knowledge.” The Chinese has 諸佛無量智慧 (zhu fo wu liang zhi
hui, “immeasurable wisdom of the buddhas”).

gcig (“one instant”), apparently translating from a manuscript that had kṣana

(“nature”).
According to the Sanskrit tryadhva. The Tibetan and the Chinese omit “the
three times.”

Palace have mnyan pa thams cad (“all that is heard”), perhaps translating from
a Sanskrit manuscript that had sarvaśrava or sarvaśruta. The Chinese has 凡所
聞法皆能忍受, 清淨信解 (fan suo wen fa jie neng ren shou, qing jing xin jie, “He
could retain all the Dharmas he had heard and understand with pure faith”),

limitless beings”). The Tibetan translates as mying (archaic spelling for
“name”).
From the Sanskrit kṣuradhārā. The Tibetan Kangyurs have spu gri’i sos gshib pas
’khod pa (“arranged with rows of razor blades”). Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, and
Narthang have spu gri’i sos gshibs pas ’khor ba (“encircled by rows of razor
blades”). The Choné differs slightly from these, reading spu gri’i sos bshibs pas
’khor ba. The Chinese has ⼑⼭ (dao shan), a compound of “blade/sword” and
“mountain,” without the term “path” or “rows.” In his commentary, 澄觀
(Cheng Guan) explains that ⼑⼭ is a metaphor for 無分別智 (wu fen bien zhi;
Skt. nirvikalpa-jñāna, niṣkalpanā-jñāna, avikalpa-jñāna, “nonconceptual
wisdom”). See Cheng Guan 澄觀. Da fangguang fohuayan jingshu ⼤⽅廣佛華嚴
經疏. Taishō 1735, 57: 932a3–4. The Chinese has an additional phrase 登彼⼭
上投⾝⼊⽕ (deng bi shan shang tou shen ru huo), “he climbed up that mountain
and threw his body into the fires,” which, according to Cheng Guan, means
that he had cut off all obscurations and attained realization. See Cheng Guan

man, “who has all the qualities described by the ten synonyms of a buddha”).
In the Sanskrit and the Chinese this is not the name but a description of the
park, “the king’s (or ‘beautiful’) great park that has an array of precious

meaning, recorded in the Mahāvyutpatti as mdzed pa (“beautified,”

According to the Sanskrit mahā. Omitted in the Tibetan. In the Chinese, mahā

The BHS is the obscure khoṭaka. The Tibetan lan kan is equated in the
Mahāvyutpatti with vedīka (“balcony”), but vedika is next in the list of features,
and therefore lan kan here has a different meaning than that ascribed to it in
the Mahāvyutpatti. The tshig mdzod chen mo (Tibetan–Chinese dictionary)
states that lan kan is Chinese for pu shu, which the Mahāvyutpatti equates with
harmya. Earlier in this translation lan kan was used to translate harmya.
From the Sanskrit vedīka. This is translated into Tibetan as stegs bu
(“platform”).

From the Tibetan gnas rnam pa tha dad pa, while gnas could have other
meanings, including “locations.” The Sanskrit has adhimātratā
(“excessiveness”). Cleary has “measurelessness.” The Chinese has 差別相
(cha bie xiang), one of the common translations of adhimātratā. Here it can
mean “different aspects.”

clouds.”

myu gu. Other Kangyurs have myi gu, mi gu, and mgu ba.
According to the Tibetan ’phags pa’i tshogs kyi dkyil ’khor, presumably
translating from a manuscript that read sarvārya maṇḍala gaṇa. The Sanskrit has
sarvārtha maṇḍala gaṇa (“the circle, or field, of all benefits, or goals”) and the
Chinese concurs.
According to the Sanskrit apaśyat and the Chinese. Omitted in the Tibetan.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “the banner of the power over all
sensations.” In the Chinese translation, the 60-volume edition names the first
two samādhis as 覺⼀切 (jue yi qie, “realizing all,” “aware of all”) and 奇特幢
(qi te chuang, “amazing banner”). The 80-volume edition starts with 了⼀切希
有相 (liao yi qie xi you xiang, “seeing clearly all rare aspects”).
The Tibetan appears to have been translating from a manuscript that had
sarva jagad dhita so that it has ’gro ba thams cad dang bral ba. In the Chinese
translation, the 60-volume edition has 遠離⼀切眾⽣ (yuan li yi qie zhong sheng,
“separated from all beings”). The 80-volume edition has 遠離⼀切世間 (yuan li
yi qie shi jian, “separated from all worlds”). The Sanskrit sarva jagad dhita means
“benefit of all beings.”
This could mean power over a million devas or worlds. Mahābrahmā is in the
form realm, and his paradise extends over many world systems and their
desire-realm paradises, to the extent of a thousand million. Therefore, that
may be what is meant here. The Tibetan does not state what the number
refers to and translates as “does not engage in the kleśas of the desire
realm.” Cleary has unspecified “gods” who “live in the realm of desire.” In
the Chinese translation, the 80-volume edition does not specify whether it
was one million devas or one million desire realms. The 60-volume edition
mentions neither the number nor the objects.

(shen xiu) or 勤習 (qin xi), both of which can mean “practice deeply” or “study
diligently.” Here it is translated simply as 修⾏ (xiu xing, “practice”).
According to the Sanskrit indra. The Tibetan has rgyal po (“king”) here, but
very soon in this chapter translates as dbang (“lord”). To maintain
consistency it has been translated as “lord” here. The Chinese interprets this
line as 光明照世間 (guang ming zhao shi jian, “brilliant light illuminates the
world”). Here “brilliant light” might refer to the clarity of her mind or the
splendor of her qualities.
The Sanskrit here for “mountain” is acala (literally, “immovable”) and is a
play on words in reference to her name, Acalā, which is lost in translation.

as tala. At this point the Sanskrit has tattva (“true nature”) and Cleary accords.
Omitted in the Chinese. Carré translates as tous les enseignements (“all the

From the Tibetan yid chas and in accord with the Chinese. The Sanskrit has
the BHS adhimokṣa (“dedication to”). In the Chinese, the 80-volume edition
has 難知 (nan zhi), “difficult to know or understand,” and the 60-volume
edition adds 難說 (nan shuo), “difficult to explain or express.”
According to the Sanskrit duhitā, the narrative, and the Chinese. The Tibetan
translates as the obscure feminine term bu cig ma, which appears to be
another way of writing bu mo gcig pa, though it could be interpreted in
Tibetan to be the feminine form of bu gcig pa “only child.”
From the Tibetan mi nyal. The Sanskrit has rātryāṃ praśāntāyāṃ (“on a silent
night”). Not present in the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit rājapura (which could also mean “the king’s city,” “the
king’s palace,” or “the king’s apartments”). The Tibetan has just rgyal po’i sgo
(“the king’s door”), so that there appears to have been an omission. Not
present in the Chinese.
The Tibetan appears to have translated from a manuscript with a scribal
corruption. It has mi zad pa (“unceasing,” which would be from akṣaya).

According to the Tibetan dran pa and the Chinese 念 (nian). The BHS is

were wrong in interpreting the word as “remember.”

assumes an elided initial a, which would result in “lord of the asuras,”
though it does not appear to fit the context in the Tibetan where asuras are
being vanquished. However, in the Chinese translation, the 80-volume
edition has the lord of the asuras “who can subjugate the ocean of kleśas
throughout the great cities of the three realms,” 遍撓動三有⼤城煩惱海 (bian
nao dong san you da cheng fan nao hai). Carré has roi des asuras, and Cleary “lord
of the asuras.”
From the Tibetan brjod pa, presumably from the Sanskrit varṇitam. Not present
in Vaidya.
From the Tibetan yongs su bsgom pa, which would have been translating
paribhāvita. Not present in Vaidya or the Chinese, where the list is shorter.

According to the Sanskrit samīkurvan and most Kangyurs, which read mnyam
par bya ba byed pa. Degé has the error mnyam par bya ba myed pa. Cleary
translates as “living up to it.” Not present in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit dhāraṇi, the Narthang and Stok Palace gzungs, and
the Chinese 陀羅尼 (tuo luo ni). Other Kangyurs have the error gzugs (“form”).

令其迴向⼀切智位 (ling qi hui xiang yi qie zhi wei, “make them dedicate for
attaining omniscient wisdom”).
According to the Tibetan. The Chinese adds two synonyms of buddhas.
The Tibetan translates this by using a double negative.

(“noose splitting”). The Chinese has 九⼗六眾 (jiu shi liu zhong, “ninety-six
groups of individuals”).

The Sanskrit nāga is used as a synonym for “elephant,” but the phrase
nāgsaṃkṣobha occurs a little later in this text in reference to nāgas. In this case,
however, it may refer specifically to cobras, as nāga in India is the name both
for the cobra and the deity, which is a “cobra deity.” What is being referred
to here may be the confrontations that occurred in India between elephants
and cobras. The Chinese translates the name of the perfume by “elephant”
象藏 (xiang zang) in association with “nāgas” (⿓, long).
The Degé print has here page 594 (folio 297.b) in error for 94 (folio 47.b). The
page number has been emended in the Degé reader.
This refers to infantry, chariots, cavalry, and elephants.

“differentiation.” Carré, translating from the Chinese, has Pur Ornament, and

śuddhovyūha.

downward (literally, “high-low”), safe-dangerous, clean-dirty, and crooked-

’byung ba’i rgyu, which would literally be “the cause of the arising of” as in
the Chinese ⽣⼤智因 (sheng da zhi yin).
The Tibetan interpretation of the compound could be taken to mean “various
gateways and continuums” (with rgyud translating āvartanaya). In Chinese,
this and the preceding phrase are conjoined as one, and āvartanaya is
translated as 旋 (xuan, “revolving”).
According to the Tibetan (though it translates this part of the compound as
“cause of the arising of and the purity of” instead of “the pure arising of”).

“employ”).

According to the BHS meaning of nimṇa, which can mean “aiming at” or
“leading to.” Otherwise it has the meaning “downward,” and therefore this
compound nimnonnata can mean “up and down” or “high and low.” The
Tibetan appears to have tried to make sense of this by adding a negative thur
med (“not downward”). It is possible to interpret the phrase to mean “the
lower and higher part of the path to omniscience.” The Chinese translates as
⼼無⾼下 (xin wu gao xia, “mind is free from ‘high and low’ ”).

(“go”). The Chinese makes additional mention of “numerous merchants.”

Chinese translates as 我慢 (wo man, “self-pride”) and repeats an alternative
translation of the term simply as 我 (wo) in the next short phrase.
According to the Sanskrit mamakārotsargāya and the Chinese 我所 (wo suo). Its
translation appears to be missing from the Tibetan.

unusual dharmata (cf. dharmatā “true nature”).

Sanskrit has sarvān (“all”). The Chinese translates as “all beings.”
Literally, “ten million (koṭi; bye ba) times a hundred thousand million (nayuta;
khrag khrig).” In other words, a million million million. The Chinese has “one
million nayuta times one koṭi” (10  according to the definition given in both
Śikṣānanda’s fascicle 30 and Prajñā’s fascicle 10).
41
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has “hundred” (brgya) instead of
hundred thousand million (nayuta; khrag khrig), so it would be only a hundred
million million. The number quintillion in Tibetan is literally “ten million (koṭi;
bye ba) times a hundred thousand million (nayuta; khrag khrig),” i.e., a million
million million.

it is a part of the city’s name. The Chinese has just 寶 (bao), “jewels” or

beings. According to the Avataṃsaka sūtra one koṭinayuta would be 10 .

a manuscript that had Ratnārci parvata pradīpa. The Chinese is the same as the
Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit abhirata. The Tibetan translates as dad dga’.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has rgyal ba (jina) instead of bde bar
gshegs pa, presumably because of the verse meter. This line is absent in the
Chinese.
Tibetan has literally “the last.” The name of each buddha is preceded by a
sequential number, so this is “the tenth.”
According to the Sanskrit vibuddha, translated into Chinese as 明了 (ming liao,

There are three compounds in this verse. This compound, which in the
Sanskrit is in the nominative case, has been chosen to be the name of the
realm. This is because in other verses the names of realms are given in the
nominative case. The other two compounds, which are in the accusative
case, are translated as descriptions of “realm,” which is also in the accusative
case. However, the Tibetan translation chose Samanta prabha megha, “constant
shining clouds,” as the name of the realm. The Chinese has, as the first three
lines, “After that came a kalpa named 寂靜慧 (ji jing hui, “Peaceful/Tranquil
Wisdom”), and the pure realm named ⾦剛寶 (jin gang bao, “Precious Vajra”).”
From the Sanskrit vibuddhi. The Tibetan has dag, presumably translating from
a manuscript that read viśuddhi. The Chinese here gives names for the kalpa
and the realm.
The Sanskrit has daśakalpa, which would be “ten kalpas.” The Chinese here
gives names for the kalpa and the realm.
According to the Tibetan chags med. Not present in the Sanskrit. The Chinese
has 無礙 (wu ai), “free of obstacles.”
According to the Tibetan, which has dpal gyi bdag, presumably translated
from a manuscript that had śirirāja (a BHS form of śrīrāja). The Chinese has 功
德王 (gong de wang), presumably translating from śirirāja as well; and very
likely, to distinguish from it, Guṇa rāja is translated as 佛功德王 (fo gong de
wang), adding 佛 (fo, “Buddha”) at the beginning of the name. The Sanskrit
has Girirāja (“Mountain King”).
The Tibetan (including Stok 644) mtshan gyi appears to be a scribal error for
mtshan ri.
According to the Sanskrit, the Lhasa and Stok Palace chos dbang rgyal po, and
the Chinese 法⾃在 (fa zi zai). Degé and others have chos dbyangs rgyal po
(Dharma ghoṣa rāja).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has narendra (“lords of humans”). The
Chinese has 佛 (fo, “buddhas”).
The Tibetan has zhing (“realm”) in error for zhi (“peace”), which would be the
translation for śanta. The Chinese has 寂靜⾳ (ji jing yin, “Peaceful Voice”).
The Sanskrit is sura, which is a synonym of deva. “Lords of devas and
humans” is absent from the Chinese.

According to the Tibetan. The Tibetan dpal appears to be translated from
Śiripradīpa (BHS equivalent to Śrīpradipa). The present Sanskrit has giri and
divides the compound into two names. The Chinese has 功德海 (gong de hai,
“Ocean of Merit”), which is the same as Sāgara śrī in verse 69.
According to the Tibetan rgyal ba, translated into the Chinese as 佛 (fo,
“buddha”). The Sanskrit has narendra (“lord of humans”).
According to the BHS nigarjasu. The Tibetan translates as bshad pa. The
Chinese has 說 (shuo, “explained,” “taught”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has “the adornment of compassion”
instead of “the essence of compassion,” and this occurs in the third line
instead of the first. The Chinese has the last two lines as “the increase of the
aspiration to enlightenment and the accomplishment of the strengths of
tathāgatas.”
According to the Tibetan and also the Chinese (with “self” and “purity”
reversed in order).
According to Lhasa ldongs. The Degé reads mdongs (“face,” “appearance”).
The Chinese has 覆 (fu, “covered by”).
According to the Tibetan. The Chinese has 往來貪欲海 (wang lai tan yu hai,
“going back and forth in the ocean of desires”).
According to the Tibetan bris from one of the meanings of vicitrita. The

For the lower realms.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has sugataputra. The Chinese has 得⼊
普賢道 (de ru pu xian dao, “entered the path of Samanta bhadra”).

“power.”

According to the Tibetan yangs, presumably translating from a manuscript
that had vipula. The present Sanskrit has vimala (“stainless”). The Chinese
has “all wheels of Dharma.”
According to the Sanskrit, and the earlier and following version in Tibetan.
Here, the Tibetan has yon tan (“qualities”) instead of shugs (“power”), which
would be the correct translation for vega. The Chinese omits “power” here.
This list according to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has a variant list, as does the
Chinese.
According to the Tibetan rjes su sems pa, which appears to have translated
anucintena. The present Sanskrit has anugatena (“following”). Based on the
Chinese syntax, the search for Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī starts with the
phrase ⼀⼼願得⾒善知識 (yi xin yuan de jian shan zhi shi, “wished with single-
minded resolution to see the kalyāṇamitra”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have “the domain of the
faculty of contemplating seeing a kalyāṇamitra.” In the Chinese, the phrases
“without forgetting it even for one moment” and “with all faculties
undistracted” belong to the description of how Sudhana was remembering
and honoring the teaching received from Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā.
According to the Sanskrit samudācāreṇa. Not present in the Tibetan or the
Chinese.
According to the Degé mthu, translating the Sanskrit vikrama. Yongle,
Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné do not have mthu (“power”). With the omission
of a shad marker, the Tibetan appears to conjoin this with the following
quality, although there is no genitive particle to do so. This and the
preceding phrase are absent in the Chinese.
From the BHS ekotībhāvagata. The Tibetan translates as rgyud kyi tshul gcig tu
gyur pa, which could be translated as “being of one mind with.” In the
Chinese this appears to be part of the first phrase describing the search for
Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan omits the word “all,” resulting in “the
roots of merit of being of one mind with.” Not present in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have an error, reading “the
area called the samādhi that is completely free of dust.” The Chinese has 究竟清淨
輪 (jiu jing qing jing lun, “the cakra of ultimate purity”).

According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit states that there are beings in those
realms. Here the Chinese describes how Sudhana saw all the worlds,
dwelling on five “earth wheels” 地輪 (di lun).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit does not have “and nonhumans.” The
Chinese appears to have split this phrase into two: 諸趣輪轉 (zhu qu lun
zhuan, “rotation of the wheel of realms”) and ⽣死往來 (sheng si wang lai,
“migration between life and death”).
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese. There appears to be an omission
in the Sanskrit.
The Sanskrit at this point also has “focused on the creation of all good
actions.” The Chinese and Tibetan do not have this phrase.
The Sanskrit has “gazed upon her face.” The Chinese has ⼀⼼瞻仰 (yi xin
zhan yang, “[gazed upon her] respectfully and one-pointedly”).
According to the Sanskrit vipula and the Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, Narthang,
Lhasa, and Stok Palace yangs. Degé has yang. The Chinese has 尊妙 (zun miao,
“excellent and beautiful”), migrating adjectives from the second line.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit translates as “adorned with the
jewels of the excellent signs.” The Tibetan has bris pa (“painted”), which
might be a scribal error for spras pa as a translation of ābharaṇa, or perhaps a
translation of citravicitra. The Chinese has “adorned with various signs,”
omitting adjectives.
According to the Sanskrit anupama. The Tibetan, as it does not have the
negative, has “in the manner of examples.” The Chinese has 微妙 (wei miao,
“excellent,” “marvelous”).
According to the Tibetan. BHS ābhakūṭu, i.e., abhakūṭa, would mean “a mass of
light,” as in Cleary, “multitude of lights.” Carré, translating from the
Chinese, has entre-sourcils (“between the eyebrows”). The Tibetan has phrag
pa’i lhun po (“mass of the shoulders”). The Chinese has 兩眉 (liang mei, “two
eyebrows”), which can be understood as a reference to “between the
eyebrows,” as in verse 10.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan interprets the compound as “clouds
of mists and vast suns.”
According to the Tibetan, presumably translating from vimalāt. The Sanskrit
has vimalāḥ, making “stainless” an adjective for “the clouds of suns,” as in

san you hai, “liberate [beings from] the ocean of the three states of existence”).
The Sanskrit is pratyekajina. The Chinese has 三乘 (san sheng, “three yānas”).

body”). The Chinese translates as 體 (ti, “body”) but can also mean “mass.”

Other Kangyurs (including Stok) have ’dren (“led”).
From the Tibetan ’bru, translating kośa. The Chinese has 奇寶 (qi bao, “rare
jewels”).
According to the Sanskrit subhikṣa. The Tibetan translates as rtag tu lo legs
(“always good harvests”), which could seem to contradict the earlier
description of spontaneous harvests. The Chinese has 豐 (feng, “abundance,”
“good harvests”).
According to the Sanskrit virāṇāṃ, the Chinese 勇健 (yong jian, “courageous
and strong”), and the Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Choné, Lhasa, and Stok
Palace rtul phod. Degé has rdul phod.
According to the Sanskrit parasainya pramardakānāṃ. The Tibetan translates
obscurely as gzhan gyi ’khor.
From the Tibetan and the Sanskrit. Cleary omits this. Carré has “born at the
same time as the cakravartin.” The Chinese is 與王 … 同時誕⽣ (yu wang …
tong shi dan sheng).
According to the Sanskrit pariṇāyaka. The Tibetan has just blon po (“minister”).
The Chinese has 良⾂ (liang chen, “good ministers,” “virtuous ministers”).
According to the Sanskrit abhinīlanetra. The Tibetan translates as “black and
white.” The Chinese has ⽬髮紺青 (mu fa gan qing, “eyes and hair in reddish
black”), which is the same as the color of the Buddha’s eyes and hair.
According to the Tibetan and the later mention of her name in Sanskrit. The
Sanskrit manuscript may have had a scribal error resulting in the name
concluding with śrīr nāma cakravartin instead of śrīcandra. The Tibetan omits
the reference to her being a cakravartin’s daughter.

lifespan. There was no death during it.” Carré’s translation agrees with the

in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has the plural. The Chinese has ⼀切
(yi qie, “all,” “everything,” “everywhere”).
From the Sanskrit maṣi. The Tibetan translates according to its alternative
meaning as “ink,” though it is not liquid that is meant here. It could mean a
block of ink. The “lampblack powder” (also called “powder black”) was
commonly used in India for eye makeup. The Chinese also translates
according to the meaning of “ink,” as 聚墨 (ju mo, “piled ink,” “a pile of ink”).
There is a slight, but not identical, variation in the name in both the Tibetan
and the Sanskrit. See g. 1030.

present in the Sanskrit or the Chinese.
The Tibetan rig pa does not here translate vidyā but gati, which is most

many other meanings. Here it has the meaning as in gatiṃgata.

the Tibetan, resulting in an unintelligible sentence. The Chinese refers to it
as “that ocean of world realms.”
According to the Sanskrit. The end of the previous sentence and the
beginning of this sentence are missing in the Tibetan, which has suffered a
scribal corruption, due to repetition of similar sentences in the original

numerous world realms.” The description of kalpas is not present in the
Chinese.

as the sun”). The Chinese concurs. The Tibetan has gdugs, which is normally
“parasol” but can also mean “sun.”
According to the Sanskrit, and in accord with the pond architecture of India

palace of the good Dharma in the middle of that central pond.” “Middle” was

“sitting upright,” as in the Chinese 端⾝ (duan shen).
According to the Sanskrit prāsādapṛṣṭha. The Tibetan translates as pho brang

According to the Sanskrit suciraṃ and the Chinese 良久 (liang jiu). Not
present in the Tibetan unless it is translated as rgyangs bcad pa.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit compound could be translated as
“commonality of the kalyāṇamitras.” The following long section on
“commonality” is interpreted quite differently in Cleary and in Carré via the
Chinese. The Tibetan phyir could be translated as either “because” or “in
order to,” but the Sanskrit is clearly in the dative case and therefore has the
latter meaning. However, Carré translates as puisqu’il (“because”). The
Chinese has 於善知識⽣⼗種⼼ (yu shan zhi shi qi shi zhong xin), which can
mean “he developed ten aspirations in the presence of the kalyāṇamitra,”
i.e., the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā. Here ⼼ (xin,
“mind”) can be understood as “aspiration.”

According to the Tibetan chos, translating dharma. The Chinese has 法 (fa,

Tibetan translates as tha mi dad pa (“not different,” “undifferentiated”), which
does not appear to be the intended meaning here. Translated in the Chinese
as 差別 (cha bie).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have suffered a corruption
here, with “fearlessness,” which comes later in the list, being added here too,
and the absence of a verb for “the ways of the Dharma.” The Tibetan has,
“The commonality of Dharma practice for the ocean of all the ways of the

According to the Sanskrit locative plural case. The Tibetan translates as
instrumental. The Chinese appears to have rearranged the order of key
words and translates as 隨樂 (sui le, “the commonality of”), “following the
wishes [of beings] in manifesting objects according to the perception of
beings.”
According to the Sanskrit, though adhiṣṭhāna can mean “residence” or
“abode,” which appears to be the intended meaning here rather than
“empowerment” or “blessing.” The Tibetan has an omission of the middle of
the clause, probably missing from the Sanskrit manuscript, resulting in
simply “The commonality of the empowerment of all the tathāgatas.” The
Chinese translates as 護念 (hu nian, “blessed,” “protected”).

sa.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has kyis in error for

compound: “pariśuddhi vara pravarottama.” This presumably inadvertently omits
varṇā. The Chinese has 最勝廣⼤ (zui sheng guang da, “supreme and vast”).

stable/unchanging, not ultimate”).

been emended in the Degé reader.

According to the Sanskrit plural accusative. The Tibetan has “through roots
of merit” or in Yongle “of roots of merit.”
According to the Sanskrit, the Chinese, and the Narthang med pa, which is
absent in the Degé but occurs when this topic is soon repeated. The BHS
kalpa, vikalpa, and parikalpa were translated into Tibetan as rtog pa, rnam par
rtog pa, and yongs su rtogs pa. However, the third of these is missing at this
point in the text but occurs when this subject is repeated. The Chinese has 遠

differentiation”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Narthang and Lhasa med, which is absent
in Degé in this sentence but is preserved in the following sentence.

In the Sanskrit it is stated that he taught “for a thousand years.” The Chinese
is “for one hundred years.”

According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “all beings.” This phrase is absent
in the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit gupta and according to the Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi,
Narthang, and Choné pa. Degé has par. The Chinese separates the
descriptions of the senses and the mind: 寂定 (ji ding, “all senses are
pacified”). This literally means “peaceful and still,” so the translation would
read “like a tamed elephant, the mind…”
In accordance with the Sanskrit and the Tibetan translation earlier in the
chapter. This time the bodhisattva liberation includes the additional phrase

treasures”).

According to the Sanskrit yathāvādītathākārī (“to practice what one preaches”).
The Tibetan may have been translating from a corrupt manuscript, as it has,
literally, “to wash the body below the mouth.” The Chinese is similar to the
Sanskrit: 如說⾏ (ru shuo xing).

body.” The Chinese has 不誑 (bu kuang, “not deceive”).

“attain the faculties of a bodhisattva”).
From the BHS samanvāhṛta, which is translated into Chinese as 護念 (hu nian,
“considered/looked upon kindly [by all tathāgatas].” The Tibetan appears to
interpret this as “is focused on by all the tathāgatas.”
In accordance with the Tibetan, presumably translating from sarvajñā. The
present Sanskrit has sarvata, and Cleary agrees with “everywhere.” Carré’s
translation from the Chinese agrees with the Tibetan. The Chinese has “with

shore.”

According to the Sanskrit. “Conduct” is not present in the Tibetan. The
Chinese has 修⾏ (xiu xing, “practice”).
In the Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné, there is a very long passage of
two or three folio sides that occurs within this sentence. It is not present in
the available Sanskrit or the Chinese.
The Sanskrit has two other items in this list. The Chinese has four: “practice,
increase, complete, and accomplish.”
From the Sanskrit prabhāvayanti. Missing from the Tibetan. Here the Chinese
has 住無量處通達無礙 (zhu wu liang chu tong da wu ai, “dwell in countless
places and reach anywhere without obstruction”).
In accordance with the Tibetan. In the Sanskrit this sentence is conjoined
with the following sentence, with the verb “teach” therefore occurring only
once. The Chinese has “They manifest buddhahood to beings.”
Edgerton discusses this verse, the verb praṇidhyeti, and a possible error in the
Sanskrit. See his Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary, p. 360. The Chinese omits
numbering in all ten verses, and the third line in the first verse states “who
wish to make offerings all the time in the future.”
According to the Tibetan, presumably translating from sattva. The Sanskrit
has sarva (“all”) in reference to the realms. The Chinese has “beings and
buddhas.”
According to the Sanskrit sāra, the Chinese 堅 (jian), and the Yongle, Kangxi,
Narthang, and Lhasa brtan. Degé has bstan (“teach,” “reveal”).

According to the Sanskrit nadī and the Chinese 河 (he). Not present in the
Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit. The last two items appear to have suffered an
omission and been merged in the Tibetan to “adornment of jewels.”
According to the Sanskrit garbha. The Tibetan has chu ba (“joint” or “root”).
The Chinese has ⾦剛為莖 (jin gang wei jing, “its stalk made of vajra”).
At this point there is an apparently unintelligible sentence in the Tibetan,
with no parallel in the Chinese or Sanskrit, that appears to have been subject
to scribal corruption. Literally it states, “It had the inner levels of an ocean of
beings, kings of jewels.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “It had the display of light rays
from the filaments made of all kings of jewels.” Perhaps the Tibetan was
translated from a text that had kesaraśikhara (“tip”) instead of kesararaśmi
(“rays”). The Chinese has 花鬚 (hua xu), presumably translating from kesara.
According to the Tibetan mdzes pa. Not present in the Chinese, which may
have been translating from a text that had cāru instead of rāja (“king”).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “wish-fulfilling kings of jewels.”
According to the Sanskrit devendra and the Chinese ⼀切天王 (yi qie tian wang),
and in conformity with the following list of lords of various deities. The
Tibetan has lha ris (“classes of deities”).
According to the Sanskrit pralambita and the Chinese 垂 (chui). The Tibetan
has spyangs in error for phyang.
The Tibetan may have suffered an omission. The Sanskrit has “All the lords
of garuḍas hung precious clouds of precious cloths that adorned the sky as
an awning over the crowd of bodhisattvas.” The Chinese has 繒幡 (zeng fan,
“silk banners,” “flags”) from patākā or ketu, without mentioning the clouds.
According to the Sanskrit janma, the Chinese 初⽣ (chu sheng), and its Tibetan
translation elsewhere in this passage. In this sentence the Tibetan translates
as tshe (“life”).
According to the Sanskrit janma, the Chinese 初⽣ (chu sheng), and its Tibetan

According to the commentary, this refers to the eightfold path, with wisdom
being the right view and conduct being the other seven aspects of the path.
The Chinese has ⼗號具⾜ (shi hao ju zu, “with the ten synonyms of the
tathāgata”).
Literally, “goddess.” Devī and deva were honorific terms for kings and
queens in India.
The Sanskrit and the Chinese translate as “buddhas.”
The name differs in the prose (mnyam par gzhag pa) and verse (snga phyi
mnyam) in the Tibetan. In the Sanskrit the prose has samāpadyata, while in the
Sanskrit verse there is the phrase kalpa ādiriva ananta nāyako (literally, “a kalpa
like the first, endless, guide,” which is ambiguous). However, the Sanskrit
that the Tibetan translated from was different, with the Tibetan meaning
“The name of the kalpa was Sameness of Beginning and End.” The Tibetan
appears to have translated from a manuscript that may have had kalpa ādiriva
anta nāmako. Cleary does not give a name but simply “age.” Carré, translating
from the Chinese 悅樂 (yue le), has the kalpa’s name as Plaisirs de la Joie (“The
Pleasures of Joy”). Because of this uncertainty we have repeated the name as
given in the prose.
A different number is given in the prose. The Chinese has “eighty nayuta” in
both the prose and the verse.
According to the Tibetan. The second half of the verse in Sanskrit is quite
different, and the next three verses are not present in the Sanskrit. The
Chinese has “leaving home and going to the bodhimaṇḍa” as the third line
and “manifesting the scope of buddhahood.”
This verse is not present in the Sanskrit but is present in the Chinese.
This verse is not present in the Sanskrit. In the Chinese the fourth line is
“rain down nectar of Dharma.”
According to Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, Narthang, Choné, and Lhasa, which
have la. Degé has las (“from”). The Chinese has 內 (nei, “within”).
This verse is not present in the Sanskrit but is present in the Chinese.
According to the Tibetan khrag khrig. The Sanskrit has koṭi (“ten million”). The
number is not present in the Chinese.
The Sanskrit follows uttāpayan (“purifying”) with parijayan (“cultivating”).

In accordance with the Yongle, Lithang, and Choné. Degé has here the
particle la (“in”). The Chinese has 聖智⾝ (sheng zhi shen), which can be
understood to mean “the body of āryajñāna.”
According to the Sanskrit mantra and Cleary. Not present in the Tibetan,
Carré, or the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit animiṣa, which can mean “unblinking.” The two variant
spellings in Tibetan are blan pa myed pa and glan pa myed pa, which both mean
“not covered,” presumably referring to the eyes not being covered by the
eyelids. The Chinese has two phrases: “mind/intentions without any
momentary indolence” and “all actions are pure.”
From the Tibetan nyam nga ba, translating presumably from viṣama. The
present Sanskrit has viśaya (“range,” “field,” “scope”). The Chinese is the
same as the Tibetan.
From the Sanskrit śītibhāva. The Tibetan translates according to its other
meaning of “coolness” (bsil ba), which is also a part of the metaphor of
shelter from heat. The Chinese also translates this as 清涼 (qing liang,
“coolness”). Instead of “shelters,” it has 究竟 (jiu jing, “the ultimate,” “the
utmost”) without reference to a physical presentation.
“Of the Dharma” is according to the Tibetan. It is not found in the present
Sanskrit.
Literally, many “ten millions.” The Chinese reads 無量億千 (wu liang yi qian,
“innumerous thousands of yi”).
According to the Tibetan sems can thams cad, translating from sarvasattvān. The
present Sanskrit has sarvadharmān (“all phenomena”). The Chinese accords
with the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit, the Chinese, and the preceding passage in
Tibetan. The Tibetan omits “wisdom” here.
According to the Sanskrit saṃkrama. Degé has bzem pa (“avoid”). Yongle has
bzad pa (“endure” or “be exhausted”). Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné have bzod
pa (“patience”).
The Sanskrit has “gathers together the bodhisattvas.” The Chinese has 菩薩
攝智 (pu sa she zhi), which can be understood to mean the same as the
Sanskrit.

The Sanskrit has “that ripens the bodhisattvas.” The Chinese has “that
ripens all beings.”
According to the Sanskrit vikurvita. The Tibetan has rnam par rtse ba (“play”),
presumably translating from vikrīḍita. The Chinese has 神通 (shen tong), which
could have been translated from either vikurvita or vikrīḍita.
According to the Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, Lhasa, and Choné rnam par spyod
pa. Degé has dam par spyod pa. The Tibetan appears to have been translating
vicāra. The present Sanskrit has vihāra, usually translated into Tibetan as gnas
pa. The Chinese appears to be a translation of vihāra as 所住⽅便 (suo zhu fang
bian).
The Sanskrit has “in every direction.” The Chinese has “the ten directions.”
According to the Tibetan rta babs (Degé has rta bgab), normally used as a
translation of toraṇa, which can also mean “gateway” and “portico.”
However, the present Sanskrit has the obscure khāraka. Edgerton (p. 205)
speculates that it might mean a large number, having only found the word in
this very passage. Pali often shines a light on the meaning of BHS words, but
in Pali, khāraka is an adjective meaning “sharp” or “dry.” “Rivers,”
“vortexes,” “trees,” and “portals” are not present in the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit ākramaṇa and the Yongle, Kangxi, and Narthang gnan.
Degé has gnas (“dwell”). Not present in the Chinese.
The Sanskrit also has koṭi, which would make the number “eight hundred
and forty billion.” The Chinese translates as “It was the most important or
excellent among the eighty royal cities.”
The Sanskrit has “clouds of nets” with no reference to gold. This segment
describing the royal city and surrounding towns is not present in the
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit aṣṭapada, which apparently has the meaning of
“eight sections” (vertical and horizontal), like a checkerboard or chessboard,
referring to a game that originated in its earliest form in the first centuries of
the first millennium in India, where board games were very popular.
Therefore, this appears to be a specific reference to the eight-by-eight-square
game board, and it has been translated in The Lotus Sūtra by Tsugunari and
Akira as “like a chessboard,” or by Kern as “like a checkerboard.” Other
English translations of the Chinese have interpreted this as “eight
intersecting roads.” In the translation of this sūtra Cleary has “jeweled
checkerboards.” This passage is absent in Carré.

According to the Tibetan rkang pa’i bol and the Chinese ⾜趺 (zu fu). The term

interpreted and translated. See Edgerton (p. 118) for variant meanings in Pali,
Tibetan, and Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit. “Young” is not present in the Tibetan. All such
details are not present in the Chinese.

point douter de lui (“have no doubt in him”). Cleary has “one will be serving
the Friends thereby.” The Chinese has 疑惑 (yi huo, “doubts”).
From this point on, the Chinese appears to be in prose, while the Sanskrit
and the Tibetan present the same matter in eight verses before turning to
prose.

name Mañjughoṣa (normally translated into Tibetan as ’jam dbyangs).

as the Sanskrit in “May I not be cut off.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit and the Chinese do not have “and
beings.”
