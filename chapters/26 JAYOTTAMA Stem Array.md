JAYOTTAMA
26. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, whose mind spread great love
throughout the immeasurable realm of beings; whose being was saturated
with the tenderness
 of great compassion; who had accumulated a vast
array of the accumulations of merit and wisdom; who had become free of all
the dust, darkness, dirt, and mire of the kleśas; who had realized the equality
of all phenomena; [F.51.b] who was devoted to the path that leads
upward to omniscience; who had chosen
 the gateway for entering into
immeasurable good qualities; who had the exertion
 of firm diligence that
is unimpaired by any bad quality; who was filled
 with the vast
calmness
 of inconceivable bodhisattva samādhis; who shone with the
light of the sun of wisdom that eliminated all the darkness of ignorance; who
scattered flowers of wisdom brought by the pleasant, cool breezes of
methods; who followed the way of wisdom that emerged from an ocean of
great aspirations; and who possessed the wisdom that permeated without
impediment the entire realm of the Dharma —he had approached entry into
the city
 of faultless
 omniscience, and he yearned for the bodhisattva
path.

He arrived at the town called Nandihāra and looked and searched for the
head merchant Jayottama. He saw him on the eastern edge of the town of
Nandihāra, in a forest of ashoka trees that was called Vicitra dhvaja. He was
encircled by many thousands of householders deciding
 upon various
kinds of civic duties, and in reference to those he talked about the Dharma.
He was teaching the Dharma for the sake of eliminating all egotism;
abandoning all possessiveness;
 rejecting all attachment; forsaking all
fixation on things; destroying all clinging; cutting through all the bondage of
craving; breaking down the doors of all views; clearing away the darkness of
doubt, uncertainty, and equivocation; cleansing away the dirt of illusion and
deceit; purifying the stains of envy and miserliness; clarifying the lake of the

mind; bringing beings to a state of unpolluted mentality; giving rise to an
unpolluted faith; [F.52.a] giving rise to the aspiration to see the buddhas;
eulogizing the power of bodhisattvas; receiving the Dharma of the buddhas;
aspiring to bodhisattva conduct; giving rise to the power of bodhisattva
samādhi; teaching the power of bodhisattva wisdom; and attaining the
highest purity of the power of bodhisattva memory.
This means that he was teaching the Dharma in order to inspire the
aspiration to enlightenment.
26. 3
Then when the teaching was concluded, Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, approached and bowed his head to the feet of the head merchant
Jayottama. He bowed down to him for a long time and said, “Ārya, I am
Sudhana, I am Sudhana! I seek bodhisattva conduct. Instruct me, Ārya, on
how I should train in bodhisattva conduct and while training how I should
aspire to guide and ripen all beings,
 not forsake seeing all the buddhas,
hear the Dharma of all the buddhas, possess the rain
 from the clouds of
the Dharma of all the buddhas, practice in the way of all the buddhas,
practice bodhisattva conduct in all world realms, never tire of bodhisattva
conduct while dwelling in all kalpas, comprehend
 the manifestations of
all the tathāgatas, receive the blessing of all the buddhas, and attain
splendor in the power of all the tathāgatas.”

1142
26. 4
Then the head merchant Jayottama said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, [F.52.b] “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.
26. 5
“Noble one, I purify the gateway to omnipresent
 bodhisattva conduct
through the power of the attainment of noncomposite miracles
 while
residing in the absence of existence. In that way, remaining in this gateway
to omnipresent
 bodhisattva conduct, in all billion-world universes, in all
the Trāyastriṃśa
 paradises, in all the Yāma paradises, in all the Tuṣita
paradises, in all the Nirmāṇarati paradises, in all the Para nirmita vaśa vartin
paradises, in all the abodes of the māras, in all the places that are classed as
paradises within all desire realms, in all the nāga worlds, in all the nāga
abodes, in all the yakṣa worlds, in all the yakṣa abodes, in all the rākṣasa
worlds, in all the rākṣasa abodes, in all the kumbhāṇḍa worlds, in all the
kumbhāṇḍa abodes, in all the preta worlds, in all the preta abodes, in all the
gandharva worlds, in all the gandharva abodes, in all the asura worlds, in all
the asura abodes, in all the garuḍa worlds, in all the garuḍa abodes, in all the
kinnara worlds, in all the kinnara abodes, in all the mahoraga worlds, in all
the mahoraga abodes, in all the human worlds, in all the human abodes,
villages, towns, market towns, districts, [F.53.a] countries, and capitals, and
for all classes of beings that are within all desire realms I teach the Dharma,
reject all that is not Dharma, pacify all disputes, dispel all conflict, pacify all

quarrels, prevent all battles, pacify wars, pacify hostility, cut through all
bondage, break open all prisons, dispel all fear, and end the practice of
nonvirtuous activities. I turn beings away from killing and from taking what
is not given, sexual misconduct, telling lies, slandering, harsh speech, idle
speech, avariciousness, maliciousness, and wrong views. I turn beings away
from all that should not be done and make them engage in all virtuous
Dharma activity, and I make all beings train in all skills. I teach, prepare,
elucidate, and present all the treatises that are beneficial to the world, so as
to bring happiness to the world, to ripen beings, to follow false doctrines
in order to describe the special higher wisdom, to dispel all wrong views,
and to describe and teach all the Buddhadharma. I overwhelm and teach the
Dharma to all the devas in the form realm as far up as the Brahmā paradise.
1147
26. 6
“Just as I teach the Dharma in the world realms of this billion-world
universe, I do so in world realms in the ten directions as numerous as the
atoms in an indescribable quintillion buddha realms. I teach the Dharma of
the buddhas. [F.53.b] I teach the Dharma of the bodhisattvas. I teach the
Dharma of the śrāvakas and the Dharma of the pratyeka buddhas. I teach the
hells. I teach the path that leads to the hells. I teach the unhappiness
 of
beings in the hells. I teach the animal existences. I teach the different kinds
of animal existences, the paths that lead to animal existences, and the
suffering of animal existences. I teach the world of Yama. I teach the path
that leads to the world of Yama. I teach the suffering in the world of Yama. I
teach the higher existences. I teach the path that leads to the higher
existences. I teach the practice and enjoyment of happiness in the higher
existences. I teach the human world. I teach the path that leads to the human
world. I teach the various experiences of happiness and suffering in the
human world.
1148
26. 7
“In that way, noble one, I also teach the Dharma of the world, the creation
of the world, the destruction of the world, the transgressions in the world,
and the renunciation of the world.
26. 8
“In this way, I teach the Dharma in order to explain the bodhisattva path,
reject the faults of saṃsāra, teach the qualities of omniscience, pacify the
delusion and sufferings of the existences, describe the unobscured true
nature, illuminate the activities of being in the world, describe all the
happiness and suffering of being in the world, contemplate the designations
of the abodes of all beings, teach the tathāgata qualities that have no
location, counter the wheel of all karma and kleśas, and describe the turning
of the tathāgata’s wheel of the Dharma. [F.54.a]
26. 9
“Noble one, I know this gateway to pure, omnipresent
 bodhisattva
conduct, the stainless
 display of the noncomposite miracles
 based in
the absence of existence,
 but how could I know the conduct or describe
1149
1150

the qualities of the bodhisattvas who know all; who fill the surfaces of all
realms with illusory bodies of wisdom; who have attained the level of the
complete eyes of wisdom; who have the supreme hearing of the range of
speech, sound, and communication;
 who have attained the power of the
light of Dharma gateways that fill the three times; who are heroic beings who
have the mastery of the power of the wisdom that includes all phenomena;
who possess beautiful, fine tongues that are endowed with a domain of
speech that is directed separately, according to their aspirations, to
inconceivable, immeasurable beings; who have bodies that are like illusions
and equal to all bodhisattvas, with complexions and forms that accord with
the various wishes of an ocean of beings; who possess inconceivable bodies
that have a conduct no different from that of all the tathāgatas; who have
bodies of wisdom that follow all three times; and who have a scope and field
of conduct that is as immeasurable and vast as the expanse of space?
1153
26. 10
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land called
Śroṇāparānta, there is a city by the name of Kaliṅgavana where dwells a
bhikṣuṇī by the name of Siṃha vijṛmbhitā. Go to her and ask her, ‘How
should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
26. 11
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
head merchant Jayottama, [F.54.b] circumambulated the head merchant
Jayottama many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right,
and, looking back again and again, departed from the head merchant
Jayottama.
