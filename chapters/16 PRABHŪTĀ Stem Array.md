Chapter 16
PRABHŪTĀ
16. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had obtained the rain from the cloud of
the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras.
16. 2
He was like the ocean that never has too much rain from the clouds. The
light from the sun of the wisdom of the kalyāṇamitras had caused the
seedling of his powers to sprout from the ground of his ripened good karma.
16. 3
The net of light rays from the full moon of the instructions of the
kalyāṇamitras had brought ease to his mind and body.
16. 4
Like the herds of deer who wish to drink the clear, cooling water from the
Himalayas when they are tormented by the heat of the summer
 sun, he
longed to drink the water of the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras.
952
16. 5
The white lotuses of his mind had blossomed through the instructions of
the kalyāṇamitras to become a lotus pond like a pond with a bed of
blossomed lotuses over which hovers a swarm of bees.
16. 6
The jewels of the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras, like the island of
jewels that is completely filled with all kinds of jewels, continuously
illuminated the mind.
16. 7
Like the great accumulation of flowers and fruit on the great Jambu tree,
the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras have a perfect accumulation of merit
and wisdom.
16. 8
Like the great clouds in the sky born from the sublime play of the great
lords of serpents,
 [F.6.a] the accumulation of instructions heard from the
kalyāṇamitras expanded.
 The towering mass of the various stainless
Dharmas of the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras was like the variegated
summit of the Trāyastriṃśa paradise.
 Just as Śakra and his entourage of
the host of Trāyastriṃśa devas defeat the hosts of the lord of the asuras, the
entourage of the host of the stainless qualities that arise from the
instructions of the kalyāṇamitras cannot be surpassed but overwhelm others.

16. 9
Eventually he arrived at the town called Samudra pratiṣṭhāna. When he
was searching for the upāsikā Prabhūtā, a great crowd of people told him,
“Noble one, the upāsikā Prabhūtā is in her house in the middle of the city.”
16. 10
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went to the home of the upāsikā
Prabhūtā, and with his palms together in homage, he stood at the door.
16. 11
He saw that the upāsikā Prabhūtā’s house was encircled by a large and
extensive precious wall. It had a gateway in each of the four directions and
was adorned with countless measureless jewels that had been created from
the ripening of merit.
16. 12
Sudhana entered the house, looked around, and saw the upāsikā Prabhūtā
seated on a precious throne. She was a very young maiden who had newly
become an adult, having just reached puberty. She was surpassingly
beautiful, attractive, and lovely to look at. Her skin was an excellent, perfect
color. Her hair hung loose. She wore no jewelry. She wore a white robe and
skirt.
16. 13
Every being who saw the upāsikā Prabhūtā, whether deva or human,
conceived of the upāsikā Prabhūtā as being their teacher. [F.6.b]
16. 14
Apart from buddhas and bodhisattvas, everyone else who came into that
house was overwhelmed by her body, the power of her mind, her majesty,
and her color.
16. 15
Also, a hundred trillion
 seats had been arranged in that house. They
were superior to any human or deva seat. They had been created through
the ripening of a bodhisattva’s karma.
956
16. 16
Sudhana did not see any store of food or drink in the house, nor did he see
any store of clothing, jewelry, or possessions apart from a single small pot
placed before her.
16. 17
Sudhana saw ten thousand maidens in front of her. They all had the skin
color of apsarases, the bodies of apsarases, the manner of apsarases, the
behavior of apsarases, the pleasures of apsarases, the courtesy of apsarases,
the divine
 clothing of apsarases, the jewelry of apsarases, and the
beautiful-sounding voices of apsarases, and their waists
 were like those of
apsarases.
957
958
16. 18
Her entourage of maidens was stationed before her, fulfilling all her
instructions, gazing upon her, honoring her, venerating her, showing her
respect, facing her, listening to her, looking upon her, gazing upon her,
bowing down to her, making obeisance to her, and paying homage to her.
16. 19
The perfume that emanated from their bodies filled the entire surrounding
town with its pleasant aroma, and when beings smelled that aroma, they all
ceased to have malice in their minds, ceased to have animosity in their
minds, ceased to have aggression in their minds, ceased to have jealousy
and greed in their minds, ceased to have deception and deceit in their minds,


---

ceased to have craving and anger in their minds, ceased to go back and forth
between low and high spirits, and had loving minds, altruistic minds, self-
controlled minds, and minds that did not wish to acquire the possessions of
others.
16. 20
All those who heard the voices of those maidens [F.7.a] became delighted,
reverent, and subdued.959
16. 21
Having seen this, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to
the feet of the upāsikā Prabhūtā, circumambulated her many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and sat before her. With his
palms together in homage, Sudhana said, “Āryā, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
should practice it. Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings
to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train
in bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
16. 22
The upāsikā Prabhūtā said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the unceasing display of the treasure of merit.
16. 23
“Noble one, from this small pot, beings
 with different wishes are
satisfied by whatever foods they enjoy, with various kinds of broths, various
flavors, various colors, and various aromas.
960
16. 24
“Noble one, in that way, with this one small pot I can satisfy a hundred
beings with the foods they enjoy. I can satisfy with the foods they enjoy a
hundred thousand beings, ten million beings, a billion beings, a trillion
beings, a quintillion beings, and an innumerably-beyond-an-innumerable
number of beings with different wishes. I strengthen them, make them
joyful, [F.7.b] please them, delight them, make them content, and make them
happy. Nevertheless, this small pot is never diminished, depleted, emptied,
used up, exhausted, spent, or finished, nor does it ever come to an end.
16. 25
“Noble one, in the same way, I can satisfy, make joyful, please, delight,
make content, and make happy, with whatever foods they enjoy and with
various kinds of broths, various flavors, various colors, and various aromas,
beings with different wishes who are as numerous as the atoms in a world
realm of four continents, as numerous as the atoms in a world realm of a
thousand four-continent worlds, as numerous as the atoms in a world realm
of a million four-continent worlds, as numerous as the atoms in a world
realm of a billion four-continent worlds, and as numerous as the atoms in
innumerably more numerous than innumerable buddha realms.
16. 26
“Nevertheless, this small pot is never diminished, depleted, emptied, used
up, exhausted, spent, or finished, nor does it ever come to an end.

16. 27
“Noble one, if the beings in all world realms in the ten directions, all with
different wishes and aspirations, were all to come here, they would all be
satisfied and so on up to made happy by the food they enjoy. Just as it would
be with various kinds of food, they would all be satisfied and so on up to
made happy by various kinds of drinks, by various kinds of flavors, by
various kinds of seats, by various kinds of beds, by various kinds of steeds,
by various kinds of clothing, by various kinds of flowers, [F.8.a] by various
kinds of garlands, by various kinds of perfume, by various kinds of incense,
by various kinds of ointments, by various kinds of powders, by various kinds
of jewels, by various kinds of jewelry, by various kinds of precious carriages,
by various kinds of parasols, by various kinds of banners, by various kinds
of flags, and by various kinds from among the entire range of utensils.
16. 28
“Moreover, noble one, all the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas in a single
world realm in the east, who are in their final life, attain the result of the
śrāvaka and pratyeka buddha enlightenments by eating my food. Just as it is
in one realm in the east, so it is in a hundred world realms, a thousand world
realms, a hundred thousand world realms, ten million world realms, a billion
world realms, ten billion world realms, a hundred billion world realms, a
quintillion world realms, and world realms as numerous as the atoms in the
world realm of Jambudvīpa, as the atoms in a world realm of four continents,
as the atoms in a world realm of a thousand four-continent worlds, as the
atoms in a world realm of a million four-continent worlds, and as the atoms
in a world realm of a billion four-continent worlds.
16. 29
“In the same way, all the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas in world realms
as numerous as the atoms in innumerably more numerous than innumerable
buddha realms in the east, who are in their final life, will attain the result of
the śrāvaka and pratyeka buddha enlightenments by eating my food.
16. 30
“Just as it is for those who are in the east, so it is for all of those who are in
the south, in the west, in the north, [F.8.b] in the northeast, in the southeast,
in the southwest, in the northwest, below, and above.
16. 31
“Noble one, all those who are bodhisattvas in their last life in a single
world realm in the east will, by eating my food, be seated at the bodhimaṇḍa,
defeat Māra and his armies, and attain the highest, complete enlightenment
of buddhahood.
16. 32
“Just as it is for those in one realm in the east, so it is in a hundred world
realms, a thousand world realms, a hundred thousand world realms, ten
million world realms, a billion world realms, ten billion world realms, a
hundred billion world realms, a quintillion world realms, and world realms
as numerous as the atoms in the world realm of Jambudvīpa, as the atoms in
a world realm of four continents, as the atoms in a world realm of a thousand
four-continent worlds, as the atoms in a world realm of a million four-

continent worlds, and as the atoms in a world realm of a billion four-
continent worlds. Those and others up to all those who are bodhisattvas in
their last life in world realms as numerous as the atoms in innumerably more
numerous than innumerable buddha realms in the east will, by eating my
food, be seated at the bodhimaṇḍa, defeat Māra and his armies, and attain
the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood.
16. 33
“Just as it is for those who are in the east, in the same way all those who
are bodhisattvas in their last life in one world realm in the south, in the west,
in the north, in the northeast, in the southeast, [F.9.a] in the southwest, in the
northwest, below, and above will, by eating my food, be seated at the
bodhimaṇḍa, defeat Māra and his armies, and attain the highest, complete
enlightenment of buddhahood.
16. 34
“Just as it for all those who are bodhisattvas in their last life and so on up
to those in one realm in the upward direction,
 so it is in a hundred world
realms, a thousand world realms, a hundred thousand world realms, ten
million world realms, a billion world realms, ten billion world realms, a
hundred billion world realms, a quintillion world realms, and world realms
as numerous as the atoms in the world realm of Jambudvīpa, as the atoms in
a world realm of four continents, as the atoms in a world realm of a thousand
four-continent worlds, as the atoms in a world realm of a million four-
continent worlds, as the atoms in a world realm of a billion four-continent
worlds, and so on, up to all those who are bodhisattvas in their last life in
world realms in the upward direction that are as numerous as the atoms in
innumerably more numerous than innumerable buddha realms in the east.
All those who are bodhisattvas in their last life will, by eating my food, be
seated at the bodhimaṇḍa, defeat Māra and his armies, and attain the
highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood.
961
16. 35
“Noble one, do you see these ten thousand maidens?”
Sudhana replied, “Āryā, I see them.”
16. 36
The upāsikā Prabhūtā said, “Noble one, myself and these maidens [F.9.b]
and countless millions of others have the same conduct, the same prayer, the
same roots of merit, the same display of setting forth, the same pure path of
aspiration, the same pure mindfulness, the same pure mode of being,
 the
same measureless realization, the same attainment of the highest faculties,
the same pervasion of mind, the same range of the scope of conduct, the
same way of the Dharma, the same ascertainment of meaning, the same
teaching of the meaning of the Dharma, the same pure form, the same
measureless strengths, the same voicing of the words of the Dharma, the
same pure voice in all our communication,
 the same pure qualities in all
our conduct because we are praised for limitless qualities, the same purity of
karma because of having the pure ripening of faultless karma, the same all-
962

pervasive great love because of our protection of all beings, the same
pervasive great compassion because of our tireless ripening of all beings, the
same pure karma of body because we manifest the bodies that satisfy beings
according to their wishes, the same pure karma of speech in communicating
the meaning of the words in the realm of the Dharma, the same arrival into
the circles of the followers of all the buddhas, the same eagerness for all the
buddha realms in order to serve and make offerings to all the buddhas, the
same directly perceived knowledge in comprehending all the ways of the
Dharma, [F.10.a] and the same pure conduct in attaining all the bodhisattva
levels.
16. 37
“Noble one, these ten thousand maidens, within one single instant, travel
throughout the ten directions in order to offer food to the bodhisattvas in
their final life. They take food from this small pot and go throughout the ten
directions in order to offer it as alms to śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas in
their final life. They take food from this small pot and go throughout the ten
directions in order to satisfy all the hosts of pretas with the food.
16. 38
“Noble one, in that way I satisfy the devas with divine food from this small
pot, and I satisfy nāgas with nāga food, yakṣas with yakṣa food, gandharvas
with gandharva food, asuras with asura food, garuḍas with garuḍa food,
kinnaras with kinnara food, mahoragas with mahoraga food, humans with
human food, and nonhumans with nonhuman food.
“Noble one, stay a moment and you will see a sight.”
16. 39
As soon as the upāsikā Prabhūtā said those words, at that moment, having
been invited by the upāsikā Prabhūtā in the prayers she made in the past,
countless beings came in through the eastern door. In the same way,
countless beings, invited by the upāsikā Prabhūtā in the prayers she made in
the past, came in through the southern, the western, and the northern doors.
[F.10.b] Seated on her throne, the upāsikā Prabhūtā satisfied, made joyful,
pleased, delighted, made content, and made happy those beings who had
arrived with whatever foods they enjoyed, in various kinds of broths, with
various flavors, various colors, and various aromas.
16. 40
Just as with the food, she satisfied them and so on up to made them happy
with various kinds of drinks, various kinds of flavors, various kinds of seats,
various kinds of beds, various kinds of steeds, various kinds of clothing,
various kinds of flowers, various kinds of garlands, various kinds of
perfume, various kinds of incense, various kinds of ointments, various kinds
of powders, various kinds of jewels, various kinds of jewelry, various kinds
of precious carriages, various kinds of parasols, various kinds of banners,
various kinds of flags, and various kinds from among the entire range of
utensils.

16. 41
She satisfied and so on up to made happy devas with divine food, and she
and satisfied nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras,
mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans with their food.
Nevertheless, her small pot was never diminished, depleted, emptied,
used up, exhausted, spent, or finished, and it never came to an end.
16. 42
Then the upāsikā Prabhūtā said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “I
know only this bodhisattva liberation called the unceasing display of the treasure
of merit. How could I know or describe the qualities of the conduct of
bodhisattvas who have an inexhaustible ocean of merit, [F.11.a] who possess
inexhaustible merit, who have accumulated a vast accumulation of merit and
are therefore like space, who fulfill the prayers of all beings and are therefore
like the king of wish-fulfilling jewels, who protect the roots of merit of all
beings and are therefore like a Cakravāla mountain range of merit, who send
down a rain of jewels from their hands and are therefore like a great cloud of
merit, who open the gate to the city of the Dharma and are therefore like the
direct vision of a treasure of great merit, and who dispel the darkness of the
poverty of all beings and are therefore like a lamp of great merit?
16. 43
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called
Mahāsaṃbhava. There dwells a householder by the name of Vidvān. Go to
him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
16. 44
Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of the upāsikā Prabhūtā,
circumambulated the upāsikā Prabhūtā, keeping her to his right, many
hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking back again and again,
departed from the upāsikā Prabhūtā.
