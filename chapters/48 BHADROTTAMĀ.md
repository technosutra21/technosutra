BHADROTTAMĀ
48. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went to the town called Vartanaka in the
region of Kevalaka and approached the kalyāṇamitra Bhadrottamā. When he
approached the kalyāṇamitra Bhadrottamā, he bowed his head to her feet,
and then he stood before the kalyāṇamitra Bhadrottamā with his palms
together in homage and said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas
should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
[F.276.b] Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
48. 2
When he had said that, the kalyāṇamitra Bhadrottamā said, “Noble one, I
know and teach the Dharma teaching called The Field without Location, and I
have attained the samādhi called unimpeded.
 That samādhi is unimpeded
toward any phenomenon, and when I rest within it, I have the unimpeded
eyes of omniscience, I have the unimpeded ears of omniscience, I have the
unimpeded nose of omniscience, I have the unimpeded tongue of
omniscience, I have the unimpeded body of omniscience, I have the
unimpeded mind of omniscience, I have the unimpeded waves of
omniscience, I have the unimpeded lightning
 of omniscience, and I have
the unimpeded power of omniscience and the field of the illumination of
beings.

“Noble one, I know only this Dharma teaching called The Field without
Location. How could I know completely unimpeded bodhisattva conduct?
48. 4
“Depart, noble one. In the southern region there is town called
Bharukaccha. There resides a goldsmith by the name of Muktāsāra. Go to
him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in and practice
bodhisattva conduct?’ ”

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
kalyāṇamitra Bhadrottamā. [F.277.a] He circumambulated the kalyāṇamitra
Bhadrottamā many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right,
and, looking back at her again and again, he departed from the kalyāṇamitra
Bhadrottamā.
