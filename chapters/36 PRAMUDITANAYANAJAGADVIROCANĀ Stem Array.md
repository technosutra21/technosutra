36. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was blessed by the instruction of the
kalyāṇamitra; his mind practiced the words of the kalyāṇamitra; his mind
had the perception of the kalyāṇamitra as a physician and himself as a
patient; [F.96.a] his mind was contented by focusing on the vision of the
kalyāṇamitra; his mind had obtained the opportunity to disperse the
mountain of obscurations to the vision of the kalyāṇamitra; his mind had
attained, through seeing the kalyāṇamitra, entry into the ocean of the ways
of the great compassion that saves all the realms of beings; his mind had
attained, through seeing the kalyāṇamitra, the illumination by wisdom of the
ocean of the ways of the realm of phenomena.
Thus, he approached the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā.

He saw them declaring it, elucidating it, revealing it, communicating it,
categorizing it, expanding upon it, enumerating it, giving instruction on it,

36. 34
He saw some teaching the Dharma through speech from the sound of

of the aspects of voice of the different kinds of speech of each tathāgata and
describing to all beings the range of the liberation of the night goddess
Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā, including the first occurrence of developing
the aspiration to enlightenment and the accumulation of accomplishments.
[F.106.b]

36. 40
He heard them, contemplated them, scrutinized them, comprehended
them, understood them, knew them, followed them, fathomed them, and was
resolved as to their equality.
36. 41
This was because of the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā’s
having become an appropriate vessel for the completely good bodhisattva
conduct, her supremacy through the miracles of the bodhisattva liberation
called the vast banner
 of inconceivable, completely good joy, her corresponding
practice in the past, her being blessed by the blessings of the tathāgatas, and
the ripening of her countless roots of merit.
1376

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, who had attained the
illumination of an ocean of the power of great bodhisattva joy, who had been
blessed by all the tathāgatas in the ten directions, [F.107.a] placed his hands
together in homage and praised the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad-
virocanā with these appropriate verses:
36. 43
“The Dharma
 of the jinas is profound.
1377
You trained in it for countless kalpas.
In successive forms that accord with dispositions,
You pervade all beings and appear in worlds. {1}
36. 44
“Knowing that they have no self and no protector,
Have incorrect conceptions, and are continually deluded,
You guide beings by manifesting bodies and powers
Through various kinds of miracles. {2}
36. 45
“Completely free from fevers, in perfect peace,
You have a pure, nondual Dharma body.
You guide through the thunder of clouds of emanations
All beings, without exception, who are dependent on duality. {3}
36. 46
“You are never dependent, never reliant
On the skandhas, āyatanas, and dhātus.
You have a perfect form with all limbs complete,
And you guide with your roar of supremacy. {4}
36. 47
“You are liberated internally and externally.
You have risen above the ocean of duality,
Yet you manifest illusory forms for beings
In the infinite ocean of saṃsāra. {5}
36. 48
“You do not vacillate.


---

You are not complicated by pride or hurry.
You teach the nature of phenomena
And guide the fools in the world who delight in complication. {6}
36. 49
“Through remaining in an ocean of samādhis,
Your mind is one-pointed for many kalpas,
Yet you emit clouds of emanations from your pores
So as to make offerings to the sugatas in the ten directions. {7}
36. 50
“In every single instant of mind, you comprehend
The ways of entering into the strengths of the buddhas.
According to individual circumstances, you manifest
The undertakings that will gather beings
 around you. {8} [F.107.b]
1378
36. 51
“You see the oceans of existence
And the various forms painted by karma.
You purify all beings by showing them
The unobscured path of the Dharma. {9}
36. 52
“Your body is beautified by the signs of a great being,
But through the pure, perfectly good conduct,
You manifest in the world the form of a goddess
In accordance with the dispositions of beings.” {10}
36. 53
Having praised the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā with
those verses, Sudhana asked, “Goddess, how long has it been since you
entered into attaining the highest, complete enlightenment? Goddess, how
long has it been since you attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
banner of the power of vast, stainless, completely good joy?”
36. 54
The night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā recited these verses to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
36. 55
“I remember, in the past, as many kalpas ago
As there are atoms in a realm,
There was the realm Maṇi prabha sukhābha
In a kalpa called Praśantaghoṣa. {11}
36. 56
“It was filled with ten thousand quintillion1379
Four-continent world realms.
The central four-continent world, beautifully formed,
Resembled a measureless mountain of jewels. {12}
36. 57
“It was filled by the king’s cities
Numbering ten thousand quintillion.1380


---

The beautiful central royal city,
Gandhadhvajā, shone with jewels.
 {13}
1381
36. 58
“There a lord of the directions, sovereign of the land,
A cakravartin with a handsome body, appeared.
He had the thirty-two signs of a great being,
And the features of a great being also adorned his body. {14}
36. 59
“He was miraculously born from inside a lotus.
His body was golden and shone with light. [F.108.a]
He moved through the sky and filled with light
The entirety of Jambudhvaja. {15}
36. 60
“He had a full thousand sons,
All of whom had bodies with excellent limbs.
He had many millions of ministers
Who were wise, intelligent, learned, and honest. {16}
36. 61
“He had a full hundred million queens
Who resembled apsarases, were skilled in the art of pleasure,
And with loving minds, caring minds,1382
Affectionately attended that king. {17}
36. 62
“That king, through the power of the Dharma,
Caused that great land, the entirety of the four continents
As far as the Cakravāla mountain range,1383
To remain in a state of good fortune. {18}
36. 63
“I was that cakravartin’s principal
 queen.
1384
I had the voice of Brahmā and a bejeweled
 body,
1385
With a bright halo the color of gold
That illuminated for a thousand yojanas. {19}
36. 64
“After the sun had set
And the king and his sons were asleep
And the sound of music had ceased,
I slept comfortably on my bed. {20}
36. 65
“In the middle of the night,
The Buddha Śrisamudra appeared.
The Jina manifested limitless
 miracles
1386
That spread throughout the ten directions. {21}
36. 66
“That ocean of the Jina’s light
Spread through worlds as numerous a realm’s atoms.


---

Various kinds of emanated bodies
Filled all ten directions without exception. {22}
36. 67
“The earth and its mountains shook,
And a voice proclaimed, ‘A jina has come!’
Devas, asuras, humans, and nāgas
Were all delighted that a buddha had appeared. {23}
36. 68
“Many oceans of emanations appeared
From all the pores of the Buddha.
They spread throughout the ten directions
And taught the Dharma in accordance with the aspirations of beings. {24}
36. 69
“The Jina revealed to me in a dream
All those limitless miraculous manifestations. [F.108.b]
When I heard the profound thunderous sound,
I understood its meaning and was delighted. {25}
36. 70
“Ten
 thousand night goddesses
1387
Residing in the sky above me
Spoke to me, waking me from sleep,
Praising the excellence of the Jina. {26}
36. 71
“ ‘Arise, wise queen of His Majesty,
A jina has appeared in your kingdom.
This kind of good fortune is difficult to find1388
Even in a hundred oceans of kalpas.’ {27}
36. 72
“I awoke with happiness
And saw the clear, pure light.
I looked to see where this good light came from
And saw the Jina at the foot of the Bodhi tree. {28}
36. 73
“He was adorned by the thirty-two signs of a great being,
And an ocean of light rays shone from all his pores.
Just like Sumeru he was above all,
And the Jina was the same on the right and the left. {29}
36. 74
“When I saw him I was overjoyed,
And in my mind rose the aspiration to be like him.
Having seen the manifestations of the Buddha,
I made a very vast prayer. {30}
36. 75
“I requested the king to arise,
And his court and his wives also got up.


---

When they saw the vast light from the Buddha,
They all experienced physical pleasure. {31}
36. 76
“I proceeded to the presence of the Jina
Together with the king and his armed forces
And accompanied by ten million carriages1389
And many quintillions
 of beings. {32}
1390
36. 77
“For twenty thousand years
I made offerings to the Jina.
I presented him
 with the seven jewels
1391
And the earth and its oceans. {33}
36. 78
“The clouds of the qualities of an ocean of sūtras,
Which were a display arisen from an ocean of prayers,
Had all appeared from the Tathāgata
And were taught to beings according to their dispositions. {34}
36. 79
“Those night goddesses,
 wishing to benefit
 me,
1392
1393
With compassion woke me at that time.
 [F.109.a]
1394
There arose an aspiration in me toward them:1395
‘May I become like them, awakening the intoxicated.’
 {35}
1396
36. 80
“That was the prayer that I made in my mind,
My first development of the aspiration for the highest enlightenment,
Which my residing in the ocean of saṃsāra,
The ocean of existences, has not destroyed. {36}
36. 81
“I had faith in and offered to
Ten
 million trillion buddhas.
1397
While in the midst of saṃsāra’s devas and humans,
I desired the scope of pleasure and bliss. {37}
36. 82
“The first was Śrīsamudra.
After him came Guṇa pradīpa.
The third was the Jina Ratnaketu.
The fourth was the Buddha Gagana prajña. {38}
36. 83
“The fifth jina was Kusumagarbha.
The sixth jina was Asaṅga mati candra.
The seventh jina was Dharma candra prabhu rāja.
The eighth was Jñāna maṇḍala prabhāsa. {39}
36. 84
“Then came the time of the ninth jina,
Racanārci parvata pradīpa.1398


---

The tenth was Tryadhva prabha ghoṣa.
With faith, I made offerings to them all. {40}
36. 85
“I made offerings to those ten
And all the other lords of humans.
But I did not at that time attain
The vision of entering the ocean of ways. {41}
36. 86
“After that there followed the realm
That was called Sarvaratnābha
In the kalpa called Devaśrī,
In which five hundred buddhas appeared. {42}
36. 87
“The first was Śaśimaṇḍala.
The second born was Bhāskara pradīpa.
The third buddha was Jyotidhvaja,
And after him there were Maṇisumeru, {43}
36. 88
“Kusumārci sāgara pradīpa,
Jvalanaśrīśa, Devaśrīgarbha,
Avabhāsa rāja, and Prabha ketu.
The tenth was Samanta jñāna prabha rāja. {44}
36. 89
“I made offerings to those ten
And all the rest of those lords of humans.
But I delighted
 in being located in the body.
1399
I had a mind dwelling in the Dharma that has no location. {45}
36. 90
“Following that, there was [F.109.b]
The beautiful world realm
Called Dharma pradīpa megha śrī
In the kalpa called Brahmaprabha. {46}
36. 91
“In that there were countless jinas.
I made offerings to them and their followers.
From all of those sugatas1400
I heard the Dharma with great respect. {47}
36. 92
“The first jina was Ratnameru.
After him were Guṇa samudra
And the Jina Dharma dhātu svara ketu.
The fourth was Dharma samudra garjana. {48}
36. 93
“Then there were Dharmadhvaja, Dharaṇi tejas,
Dharma bala prabha, Gagana buddhi,


---

And Dharmārci meru śikha rābha,
And after them
 was Meghaśrī. {49}
1401
36. 94
“I made offerings to those ten
And all the rest of those lords of humans.
But I did not understand
 the true nature
1402
By which one enters the ocean of jinas. {50}
36. 95
“After that came the Sugata1403
Sūrya pradīpa ketu śrī
In a realm called Buddhamati,
In a kalpa called Somaśrī. {51}
36. 96
“I made offerings to all eight hundred million1404
Of those with the ten strengths who were present there,
With a variety of limitless, vast,
Numerous beautiful offerings.
 {52}
1405
36. 97
“The first after him
 was Gandharva rāja,
1406
Second was the Buddha Druma rāja,
The third jina was Guṇa sumeru,
And after him were Ratnanetra, {53}
36. 98
“Vairocana prabha vyūha,
Dharma samudra, the Buddha Tejaśrī,1407
Lokendra teja śrī bhadra,
And after them Sarva dharma prabha rāja. {54}
36. 99
“I made offerings to those ten
And all the rest of those sugatas.
But I did not attain the knowledge
That comprehended that ocean of Dharma. {55}
36. 100
“After that, there was a perfectly pure realm
Called Vajra māṇyabhedyadṛḍha tejas,1408
In which there were constant clouds of light
And the presence of numerous beautiful displays. {56}
36. 101
“Within it there were many pure beings
With few afflictions from the stains of kleśas. [F.110.a]
The kalpa was called Praśānta mati tejas
With the display of the appearance of a thousand buddhas. {57}
36. 102
“The first jina was Vajranābhi,
The second was Asaṅga bala dhārin,

Then there were the jinas Dharma dhātu pratibhāsa
And Sarva diśa pradīpa prabha rāja. {58}
36. 103
“The fifth jina was Karuṇatejas,
The sixth jina was Vratasamudra,
Then there was the Sugata Kṣānti maṇḍala pradīpa,
And the eighth was Dharma maṇḍala prabhāsa; {59}
36. 104
“Then there was Avabhāsa sāgara vyūha,
And after them was Praśānta prabha rāja.
I made offerings to those ten
And all the rest of those lords of humans. {60}
36. 105
“But I did not realize
 this nature of phenomena,
1409
The pure nature that is the same as space,
In which one should remain while practicing
In the entire vast extent of realms. {61}
36. 106
“After that, there was the beautiful realm
Called Gandha pradīpa megha śrī,
Completely purified of all the kleśas,
In the kalpa that was called Susaṃbhava. {62}
36. 107
“During that time there appeared ten million jinas
Who were all arrayed throughout that kalpa.1410
Those guides taught the Dharma,
And I retained it through the power of memory. {63}
36. 108
“The first jina was Vipulakīrti,
Then there were Dharma samudra vega śrī rāja,
Dharmendrarāja, Guṇa ghoṣa,
Dharmaśrī, and Devamakuṭa; {64}
36. 109
“Jñānārci teja śrī was the seventh
Of those lords of two-legged beings.
The eighth jina was Gagana ghoṣa,
And the ninth was Samanta saṃbhava pradīpa. {65}
36. 110
“The buddha that came after them
Was Ūrṇa śrī prabhāsa mati.
I made offerings to all those lords of humans,
But I did not purify the path free of attachment. {66}
36. 111
“After that there was the well-arranged world realm
Called Ratna dhvajāgra mati,

Which was an excellent display
Formed from all kinds of jewels. {67} [F.110.b]
36. 112
“During that kalpa, called Sārocaya,
There appeared five hundred buddhas.
I made offerings to all those self-arisen ones,
Wishing for this liberation free of attachment.

1411
36. 113
“The first was named Guṇa maṇḍala,
Then there were Śānta nirghoṣa, Sāgara śrī,

“All the jinas have followed
The purifying path of the jinas.
However, I had still not attained
The patience for entering this way of the jinas. {71}

“After that there was a completely pure
World realm of very beautiful lights
Called Śānta nirghoṣa hāra mati,1416
Where dwelled beings with few kleśas. {72}
36. 117
“In that kalpa called Sukhābhirati
There appeared eight hundred million buddhas.

Purifying the path of the supreme jinas. {73}

Called Sunirmita dhvaja pradīpa,

Called Samantābhaśrī,
During the kalpa called Anālayavyūha,
In which there were three hundred and sixty million buddhas. {80}

The lord of two-legged beings, set forth,
I was the goddess Śaśivakra,

 proclaimed
 to me

1420
Sūtras that were displays without location,

Displays that arose from an ocean of prayers,
Which I heard and retained through the power of memory. {85}
36. 130
“I attained at that time vast vision,
Samādhis, and the power of retention.
In each instant I saw oceans of jinas
And a succession of realms. {86}

The completely illuminating clouds of the way of kindness,
The aspiration to enlightenment, as vast as space,
And the vast beauty of the immeasurable buddha strengths.

36. 132
“I saw beings who were in a state of delusion,
Attached to permanence, happiness, purity, and self,1422
Blinded
 by stupidity, obscured by ignorance,
1423
Disturbed by the kleśas, and having misperceptions. {88}
36. 133
“They performed actions in a thicket of wrong views,
Following frightening paths
 under the power of craving.

Many various forms appearing
Were painted
 by karma. {89}

“Those who appeared through being born
Through the gateways to rebirth in all existences
Had bodies and minds that experienced
The torments of birth, aging, and death. {90}

“Seeing that, in order to bring them benefit and happiness
I developed the supreme motivation
Wherever those with the ten strengths appeared,
Anywhere throughout the vast extent of realms. {91}
36. 136
“From that arose clouds of prayers,
Perfect dedication to the happiness of beings,
The arising of limitless accumulations,
And the understanding of the ways of an ocean of paths. {92}
36. 137
“I obtained vast clouds of practices,
The power of clear gateways to all paths,
Vast clouds of the perfections,
And the opening of the entire extent of the realm of Dharma. {93}
36. 138
“With the vast power to ascend the bhūmis,
Practicing without attachment on the bhūmis,

In the ways of the ocean of the three times,
In each instant I came into the presence of all jinas. {94}
36. 139
“What is more, I also mastered
The completely good jinaputra
 conduct,

And I realized the ways of the ocean
Of the ten aspects of the realm of the Dharma. {95}

“Noble one, do you think that the cakravartin king, that sovereign, who at
that time, in that time, [F.112.a] was established in the unbroken lineage of
the family of the buddhas is anyone else? Noble one, do not see him in that
way. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was at that time, in that time, that king, that
sovereign, who was the cakravartin, established in the unbroken lineage of
the family of the buddhas. The night goddess who awoke me was an
emanation of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra.
36. 141
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that Bhadramati, the precious
woman who was the queen of the cakravartin in that time, at that time, was
anyone else, do not see her in that way. At that time, in that time, I was
Bhadramati, the precious woman who was the queen of the cakravartin. I
was awoken by that night goddess and inspired by her to go see the
Buddha.
36. 142
“Noble one, I developed in that one existence the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment. In that way, through the power of that
development of aspiration, I have, throughout kalpas as numerous as the
atoms in a buddha realm, never fallen into rebirth in the lower realms but
have always continuously depended on existence as a human or deva, and
in all those existences I have seen tathāgatas. Finally, through just seeing
the Bhagavat Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Ratna śrī pradīpa guṇa ketu,
 I
attained the bodhisattva liberation called the banner of the power
 of vast,
stainless, completely good joy. When I had attained it, I took on this kind of form
in order to ripen and guide beings.

1428
36. 143

power
 of vast, stainless, completely good joy. How could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who, at the feet of all the tathāgatas
[F.112.b] in each instant of mind, attain a great ocean of the power for setting
out upon omniscience; who, in each instant of mind, have completed the
attainment of an ocean of great prayers within all the entrances for setting
out upon omniscience; who, in each instant of mind, are skilled, through the
ways of making an ocean of prayers, in accomplishing a domain of conduct
in future kalpas; who are skilled in accomplishing, within each conduct, as
many bodies as there are atoms in all buddha realms; who are skilled in
pervading, with each body, the entire ocean of different ways in the realm of
1429

phenomena; who are skilled in manifesting, in each ocean of different ways
in the realm of phenomena, a perceivable conduct of the body that accords
with the dispositions of beings throughout all the buddha realms; who are
skilled in comprehending, in each ocean of different ways in the realm of
phenomena, an ocean of tathāgatas, without limit or center, within all the
atoms of a realm in all realms; who are skilled in comprehending each
tathāgata’s miraculous tathāgata manifestations that pervade the entire
extent of the realm of phenomena; who are skilled in comprehending each
tathāgata’s accomplishment of gathering the accumulation of bodhisattva
conduct in past kalpas; who are skilled in obtaining and possessing each
tathāgata’s vast
 wheel of the Dharma; and who are skilled in
comprehending the ocean of the different ways of miraculous manifestations
by the tathāgatas in the three times?
1430
36. 144
“Depart, noble one. In this circle of the Tathāgata’s assembly, not far from
me, there is the goddess of the night named Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī.
[F.113.a] Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
36. 145
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā, circumambulated the night
goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā. [B7]
