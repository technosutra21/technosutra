Chapter 44
MĀYĀDEVĪ
44. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, on the way to Māyādevī, undertaking the
wisdom of practicing the scope of the activity of the buddhas, thought, “By
what means can I see the kalyāṇamitras, honor them, meet them,
accompany them,
 learn their qualities, know the field of their speech,
understand the succession of their words, and possess the teachings of the
kalyāṇamitras who have six āyatanas that have risen above all worlds; who
have bodies that have transcended all attachments; who follow the path of
unimpeded movement; who have pure Dharma bodies; who have bodies that
are manifestations of illusory physical activities; who perform conducts in
the world that are the illusions of wisdom; who have forms and bodies
from prayer;
 who have bodies that are not born and do not cease; who
have bodies that are neither true nor false; who have bodies that do not pass
away or perish; who have bodies that do not originate and are not destroyed;
who have bodies that have the single characteristic of having no
characteristics; who have bodies that have no attachment to duality; who
have bodies that are based on having no basis; who have bodies that do not
decay
 or diminish; [F.256.a] who have bodies without thoughts, like
reflections; who have active bodies that are like dreams; who have bodies
that do not depart, like the surface of a mirror; who have bodies that are
established in peace, like the absence of directions; who have bodies that
pervade all directions; who have bodies that have no differentiation between
the three times; who have bodiless bodies of mind that are bodies without
thought; who have bodies that have transcended the path of sight in all
worlds; who have bodies that have been tamed through the path of
completely good vision; and who have the unimpeded field of activity of
space?”

While he was dedicated to contemplating and pondering this, Ratnanetrā,
the goddess of the city, appeared in the sky encircled by a crowd of sky
goddesses. Her body was adorned by varieties of jewelry, her body was
covered in adornments, and she scattered handfuls of divine flowers of
many shapes and colors.
44. 3
She said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, you should be
dedicated to protecting the city of the mind by not dwelling in delight in
saṃsāra’s field of perception. [F.256.b]
44. 4
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to adorning the city of the mind

Dharma.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to illuminating the city of the mind

of the arising of all the tathāgatas.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to creating the strong walls of the

44. 8
“Noble

you 
should 
be 
dedicated 
to 
accomplishing 
the
inapproachability and indestructibility of the city of the mind through
crushing the army of the māras, the friends of wickedness, who are on the
side of the māras and the kleśas.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to illuminating the city of the mind
through enlightening all beings with the illumination from the knowledge of
the tathāgatas.
44. 9
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to moistening the city of the mind
through acquiring the rain from the clouds of the Dharma of all the
tathāgatas.

“Noble one, you should be dedicated to strengthening the city of the mind
through your mind’s acquisition of the ocean of merit of all the tathāgatas.
44. 10
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to increasing the city of the mind
through great love pervading all beings.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to purifying
 the city of the mind
through establishing the vast parasol of the Dharma as the remedy for bad
qualities.
1851
44. 11
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to making the city of the mind
tremble
 through the mind trembling with vast, great compassion for the
sake of all beings.
1852
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to opening the gates to the city of

1853
1854
44. 12
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to purifying the city of the mind
through turning away
 from delighting in the sensory range of all of
saṃsāra.
1855
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to strengthening the heart
 of the
city of the mind through making the continuity of bad actions impossible.

“Noble one, you should be dedicated to making the city of the mind strong
through never lapsing from the diligence that accomplishes the

“Noble one, you should be dedicated to illuminating the city of the mind

44. 14
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to being skilled in the ways of
analyzing the city of the mind through being skilled in the wisdom that
analyzes the Dharma gateways of the various sūtras of the Dharma wheel of
all the tathāgatas. [F.257.b]
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to the perception of the city of the
mind through teaching the way of the path and gateways to omniscience
that are directly perceivable by all beings.
44. 15
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to being skilled in the ways of

“Noble one, you should be dedicated to increasing the power of the

44. 16
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to being skilled in the method for
emitting light from the city of the mind through knowing the minds,
thoughts, faculties, aspirations, defilements, and purification of all beings.


---

“Noble one, you should be dedicated to being skilled in the way of
gaining power over the city of the mind through gathering all the ways of
the realm of the Dharma.
44. 17
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to illuminating the city of the mind
through remembering and illuminating all the tathāgatas.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to knowing the nature of the city of
the mind through realizing all the ways of the bodyless Dharma.
44. 18
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to examining as an illusion the city
of the mind through going to the city of the Dharma of omniscience.
“Noble one, in that way the bodhisattva who is dedicated to the
purification of the city of the mind will be able to attain the accomplishment
of all roots of merit.
44. 19
“Why is that? [F.258.a] Because bodhisattvas who thus purify the city of
the mind have before them no obscurations: there are no obscurations to
seeing the buddhas, no obscurations to hearing the Dharma, no obscurations
to venerating and making offerings to the tathāgatas, no obscurations to
engaging in gathering beings, and no obscurations to purifying buddha
realms.
44. 20
“Noble one, bodhisattvas who are dedicated to seeing kalyāṇamitras with
a mind free of all obscurations and with a higher motivation will with little
difficulty see a kalyāṇamitra.
“Noble one, the omniscience of bodhisattvas depends on the
kalyāṇamitras.”
44. 21
Then two of the family of goddesses of the body, who were named
Dharma padma śrī kuśalā and Hrī śrī mañjari prabhāvā,
 encircled by an
innumerable assembly of goddesses, emerged from the bodhimaṇḍa,
uttering praises of Māyādevī. They arranged themselves in the sky before
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, and emitted from their precious
earrings
 a net of many light rays the colors of jewels; many pure
perfumes and incenses the colors of shining lights; colors attractive to mind
and thought; colors that increased the power of joy in the mind; colors that
eased the pains of the body; colors that revealed pure bodies; and nets of
light rays that were a field of perception that gave rise to an unimpeded
prowess of the body and illuminated vast realms.
1857
1858
44. 22
They revealed to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, all the bodies of all
tathāgatas, which are present everywhere and facing everywhere. [F.258.b]
Then they completely circled, to their right, the entire world, and then shone
upon the crown of the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son. They
completely pervaded him, from the crown of his head to the pores of his
body.


---

44. 23
As soon as the light rays from those goddesses touched Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, in that instant he attained the eyesight called the dust-
free illuminations, which was free from all blinding darkness. He attained the
eyesight called free from the obscuration of sight, through which he perceived
the nature of beings. He attained the eyesight called the lord of freedom from
dust, through which he looked at the field of the nature of all phenomena. He
attained the eyesight called lord of purity, through which he looked at the
character
 of all realms. He attained the eyesight called shining light,
through which he looked upon the Dharma bodies of all tathāgatas. He
attained the eyesight called pure intelligence,
 through which he looked
upon the countless categories of the created form bodies of the
tathāgatas.
 He attained the eyesight called unimpeded light, through
which he looked upon the categories of the origination and destruction of
world realms throughout the vast extent of the ocean of realms. He attained
the eyesight called complete light, through which he looked upon the aspect
of the creation of the way of the sūtras in the Dharma wheel of all the
tathāgatas. He attained the eyesight called the complete field of perception,
through which he looked upon the miracles of the buddhas and their
blessings that guide beings. He attained the eyesight called complete sight,
through which he looked upon the births of buddhas that occurred in all
buddha realms. [F.259.a]
1859
1860
1861
44. 24
Then the guardian at the door of the meeting hall of the bodhisattvas, the
leader of ten thousand rākṣasas, whose name was Sunetra, with his wives,
children, relatives, and entourage, threw flowers of many beautiful colors
over Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, and said to him, “Noble one, a
bodhisattva who has ten qualities will be near to all kalyāṇamitras. What are
these ten? They are (1) a pure motivation without deception or guile, (2) a
compassion that gathers all beings without discrimination, (3) the insight
that realizes that the nature of all beings is that there are no beings, (4) a
superior motivation for proceeding irreversibly toward omniscience, (5) the
strength of the aspiration that is directed toward the field of the tathāgatas,
(6) the vision of the purity of the stainlessness of the nature of all
phenomena, (7) the great love without discrimination for the field of beings,
(8) the light of wisdom, which dispels all obscurations, (9) the great cloud of
the Dharma, which is a parasol that counters all the suffering of saṃsāra, and
(10) the eyes of wisdom that are focused on following the kalyāṇamitras and
enter into all the streams within the realm of the Dharma.
“Noble one, the bodhisattva who has these ten qualities will be near to all
kalyāṇamitras.


---

44. 25
“The bodhisattva who sees the ten entryways to resting in samādhi will
attain the direct perception of all kalyāṇamitras. What are those ten? They
are (1) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of the field of analyzing all
phenomena as being like dust-free space, [F.259.b] (2) the entryway to
resting in the samādhi of the vision that directly perceives the ocean of all
directions, (3) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of the nonexamination
and nonanalysis of all perception, (4) the entryway to resting in the samādhi
of the arising of the clouds of tathāgatas in all directions, (5) the entryway to
resting in the samādhi of the essence of the accumulation of an ocean of
omniscient wisdom and merit, (6) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of
the development of all aspirations to be inseparably near to the occurrence of
kalyāṇamitras, (7) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of all the qualities
of the tathāgatas originating from the mouths
 of the kalyāṇamitras, (8)
the entryway to resting in the samādhi of inseparability from all the
tathāgatas, (9) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of being engaged in
being near, always and equally, to all kalyāṇamitras, and (10) the entryway
to resting in the samādhi of engaging without weariness in all the conduct of
methods of the kalyāṇamitras.
1862
44. 26
“Noble one, the bodhisattva who has those ten qualities will attain the
direct perception of all kalyāṇamitras. The bodhisattva who attains the
liberation of the samādhi called the Dharma wheels of all the tathāgatas proclaimed
from the mouth of the kalyāṇamitra will, by entering it, attain the undifferentiated
equality of all buddhas and the undifferentiated omnipresence of the
kalyāṇamitras.”
That is what Sunetra, the lord of the rākṣasas, said. [F.260.a]
44. 27
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, stared into the sky and said,
“Ārya,
 you have regarded me with compassion and without error
taught
 the kalyāṇamitras in order to benefit
 me. In addition, I pray
that you teach me without error the entrance ways to methods concerning
how to apply myself to seeing the kalyāṇamitras, in what direction I should
go, in what places I should search, and upon what goal I should focus my
thoughts.”
1863
1864
1865
44. 28
Sunetra, the lord of the rākṣasas, replied, “Noble one, you should go to the
kalyāṇamitras by going with a body that bows down in every direction, with
thoughts that are fastened on remembering the kalyāṇamitras as their object,
following the samādhi that goes everywhere, with strength of mind that is
like a dream, and traveling with a body of the mind that is like a reflection.”
44. 29
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, practicing as he had been told by
Sunetra, the lord of the rākṣasas, saw rising from the ground before him a
great lotus with a stem made entirely from diamond jewels, with sepals
made from a variety of kings of jewels of the world’s
 oceans, with a circle
1866

of petals formed from all kings of jewels, with a pericarp made of shining
kings of jewels, with filaments the colors and aromas of all the precious
kings of jewels, and covered by a net of countless jewels.1867
44. 30
He saw on the pericarp of that great lotus made of the kings of jewels a
kūṭāgāra called Dharma dhātu diksamavasaraṇa garbha, which was well
adorned and beautiful, with a base that was the shape of a shining vajra.
A full thousand pillars made from the kings of jewels beautifully adorned it.
[F.260.b] Every kind of jewel was displayed as every kind of adornment. Its
floor was made of divine Jambu River gold. Countless nets of various strings
of pearls were spread upon it. It was adorned by a beautifying blend of
various kings of jewels. It had a complete array
 of the precious jewels of
Jambudhvaja.
 It was encircled by countless precious balconies. On all
sides, stairways made of kings of jewels were beautifully arranged.
1868
1869
1870
44. 31
He saw in the center of the kūṭāgāra a throne of wish-fulfilling jewels with
a lotus on its center. It was composed of precious jewels, and its base had the
representations of all
 the lords of the world. It had the colors of all gems
of precious jewels. It had the shape of Indra’s radiant banner. It was set upon
the surface of a ground that was a circle of precious diamonds. It had an
array of rows of various kings of jewels. It was encircled by many precious
platforms. It was decorated by shining banners of kings of jewels. It was
beautified by an array of various jewels. Upon it was placed a cushion that
was superior to divine material. Its surface was covered with precious cloths
of various infinite colors. Decorative canopies of all kinds of precious cloth
adorned the sky. It was draped in nets of all jewels. In all directions there
was the sound of the flapping of arrayed precious banners. Banners of cloth
made of all jewels fluttered. It was adorned by an arrangement of banners of
all precious aromatic jewels. Banners made of all flowers emitted a rain of
showers of various flowers. [F.261.a] Banners of precious bells emitted
melodious, beautiful sounds. All the entrances
 of the building were
decorated
 with strings of various jewels. From various precious jewels in
the form of spouts issued a rain of scented water in many different colors.
From the mouths of elephant lords formed from shining kings of precious
jewels came
 networks of lotuses. From the mouths of lions made of a
variety of diamonds came
 clouds of incense in endless colors. From the
mouths of statues of Brahmā made from shining kings of jewels there
resounded in a loving manner the sound of the voice of Brahmā. From the
mouths of beautiful statues made of various jewels resounded the beautiful
sounds of praises of goodness. From strings of golden bells were emitted the
pleasant sounds of the names of the buddhas in the three times. From strings
of bells made of excellent precious jewels came the beautiful sounds of the
Dharma wheels of all the buddhas. From a variety of diamond bells came the
1871

1874
1875

sounds of all bodhisattva prayers. Various voices resounded from the images
of all the buddhas that arose from strings of moonstone
 kings of jewels.
From strings of emerald
 kings of precious jewels came manifestations of
images of the successive lives of all the tathāgatas in the three times. From
strings of sunstone
 kings of jewels appeared light rays of the range of
various buddha realms throughout the ten directions as far as the limits of
the realm of space. From strings of avabhāsadhvaja kings of jewels shone the
illumination of the halos of light of all the tathāgatas. [F.261.b] From strings
of vairocana kings of jewels radiated light rays in the forms of emanated
clouds of all the lords of worlds, who made offerings to and venerated the
tathāgatas. From strings of wish-fulfilling kings of jewels there spread
throughout the realm of phenomena in each instant the completely good
miraculous manifestations of the bodhisattvas. From strings of vairocana
kings of jewels resounded the sound of the voices of all the apsarases in the
palaces of all the lords of devas emitting clouds of praises of all perceived
tathāgatas, describing their inconceivable good qualities. The throne was
encircled by an array of seats made of countless jewels.
1876
1877
1878
44. 32
He saw upon that throne Māyādevī. She had a form that transcended the
three worlds. She had a form that resided in all worlds and was above all
existences. She had a form that was perceived by all beings according to
their aspirations
 but was unstained by any world. She had a form that
originated from vast merit and could resemble that of all beings. She had a
form that appeared to all beings but in a way that would accord with
ripening and guiding all beings. She had a form that was directly perceived
by all beings but was at all times
 no different from beings’ perception of
space. She had a form that had the power to be present
 as perceivable
throughout the extent of all beings without going anywhere. She had a form
that neither ceased nor came into existence within worlds. She had a form
that did not originate in and was not born in any world. She had a form that
was dedicated to having a quality the same as birthlessness but was also
unceasing. [F.262.a] She had a form that engaged in all conducts within the
world and was truly perceived.
 She had a form that was not real but was
perceived by the world.
 She had a form that was not false and did not
pass away.
 She had a form that transcended death and birth and was
indestructible. She had a form that had the indestructible nature of the realm
of the Dharma and had no characteristics. She had a form that mastered the
languages of the three times and had a single characteristic. She had a form
that came forth with the excellent characteristic
 of the absence of
characteristics and was like a reflection. She had a form that was perceived
by all beings in accordance with their motivations and aspirations and was
like an illusion. She had a form that was created by the illusion of wisdom

and was like a mirage. She had a form that was intent on being present
 in
the perception of beings in each instant
 and was like a shadow. She had a
form that followed beings in accordance with her past prayers and was like a
dream. She had a form that was perceived separately by beings according to
their dispositions and was active in the entire realm of phenomena. She had
a form that had a pure nature like the realm of space and arose from great
compassion. She had a form that was dedicated to protecting all the classes
of beings and arose through the gateway of the absence of attachment. She

without being polluted by them and was immeasurable. She had a form that

accomplished presence
 that guided all beings and had no presence.
She had a form that through its presence was dedicated to benefiting beings
and did not occur.
 She had a form that was created through the conjured
illusion of prayer and was unsurpassable. She had a form that was above all
worlds and was not what it seemed to be. [F.262.b] She had a form that was
perceived through the light of śamatha and was without origin. She had a
form that followed beings in accordance with their karma and accomplished
the prayers to fulfill the wishes of all beings like the king of wish-fulfilling
jewels, without thought. She had a form that was present in accordance with
the conceptions of all beings and, having no thought, was nonconceptual.
She had a form that was perceived by all beings and was without
impediment. She had a form that was dedicated to turning beings away from
saṃsāra and was completely pure. She had a form that, like the true nature,
was without conceptualization and had that kind of mode. She had a form
that appeared as form without having form and was without sensation. She
had a form that was dedicated to the cessation of the sensations of worldly
suffering and was above all the conceptualizations of beings. She had a form
that was perceived by the perceptions of all beings and arose through the
nature of not being formed. She had a form that occurred through the quality
of illusory conjuration and transcended being an object of consciousness.
She had a form that arose from the wisdom of bodhisattva prayer and had no

44. 33
Through possessing the supreme coolness of the Dharma body, Māyādevī
revealed a form body in accordance with the aspirations of beings. In
accordance with the aspirations of beings, she manifested bodies that
resembled those of all beings and were superior to the form bodies of all
beings.

44. 34
Some beings saw Māyādevī in the form of a daughter of Māra but superior
to the form of a daughter of Māra. [F.263.a]
44. 35
Some saw her as superior through having the form of one of Vaśavartin’s
apsarases.
Some saw her as superior through having the form of one of Sunirmita’s

a lord of humans.
44. 38
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, although devoid of the concepts of the

44. 39
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw Māyādevī in those ways and in
other ways as numerous as the atoms in Jambudvīpa.
44. 40
Having seen that, he blessed his own body to be as numerous as those of
Māyādevī and bowed down to them with bodies that spread among them all.


---

44. 41
The instant he bowed down, he attained a vast extent, without middle or
end, of entrances to samādhi. He looked upon those entrances to samādhi,
identified their characteristics, meditated on them, devoted himself to them,
remembered them, pervaded them, made them vast, viewed them, increased
them, accomplished them, and sealed them.

He arose from those entrances to samādhi and circumambulated
Māyādevī and her entourage, keeping her to his right, and their residence
and seats. Then he stood before her with hands together in homage and
said, “Āryā, through Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta I have developed the aspiration
for the highest, complete enlightenment and was inspired to honor the
kalyāṇamitras. In that way, I have honored one kalyāṇamitra after another
and have finally come to your feet.
44. 43
“Āryā, how does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct and
accomplish omniscience?”
Māyādevī answered, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the display of the illusory conjurations of wisdom of the great
prayers.
44. 44
“Noble one, through possessing that liberation, I have become the mother
of each one of all the bodhisattvas in their final existences who are the
Bhagavat Vairocana’s miraculous manifestations of being born into the final
existences of a bodhisattva in all the Jambudvīpas in all the world realms in
this ocean of world realms. [F.265.a] All those bodhisattvas have resided in
my belly and emerged from the right side of my belly.
44. 45
“Noble one, in the location of the great city of Kapilavastu in this fortunate
four-continent world, as a queen in the family of King Śuddhodana, I gave
birth to the bodhisattva Siddhārtha in an inconceivable, vast, miraculous
manifestation of a bodhisattva’s birth.
44. 46
“Noble one, while I was living in the palace of King Śuddhodana, the time
came for the bodhisattva to leave Tuṣita. From all his pores, from each of his
pores, shone many light rays, as numerous as the atoms in countless buddha
realms, called the illumination that comes from the field of the qualities of the mothers
of all tathāgatas, which were a display of the qualities of the mothers of all
bodhisattvas. They illuminated all world realms and shone upon me,
spreading through me from the crown of my head to all the pores of my
body.
44. 47
“Noble one, in that way, the bodhisattva light rays with one name
radiated various miraculous manifestations, displays, and liberations of the
mothers of bodhisattvas. The instant that they entered my body, I perceived
in my body the displays and modes of the miraculous births of all
1892


---

bodhisattvas, visible in the fields of the tips
 of the light rays from the
bodhisattva. Their residences and their entourages also appeared in that
way. [F.265.b]
1893
44. 48
“Noble one, in that way, the instant those light rays from the bodhisattva
entered my body, the field of the tips of the light rays from the bodhisattva
made visible to me the miracles and modes of the lives of bodhisattvas, and I
saw them all. I saw them all going to their bodhimaṇḍas, sitting on their lion
thrones encircled by assembled entourages of bodhisattvas, encircled by
lords of the world, and turning the wheel of the Dharma.
44. 49
“I also saw those tathāgatas performing bodhisattva conduct in the past,
all their service to tathāgatas, their first development of aspiration to
enlightenment, the miracles of their birth, their complete enlightenment,
their turning the wheel of the Dharma, the miraculous manifestation of their
passing into nirvāṇa, and the display of their pure buddha realms.
44. 50
“I also saw all the field of the emanations of those tathāgatas filling all the
realms of phenomena in each instant.
44. 51
“Noble one, in that way, the instant those light rays from the bodhisattva
entered my body, my own body became superior to those of all beings. My
womb became as vast as space, but my body did not appear to transcend
being a human body.
44. 52
“All the displays and residences of the wombs in which dwelled
bodhisattvas in the ten directions appeared contained within my body.
44. 53
“Noble one, in that way, there appeared in my body the wombs in which
the bodhisattvas resided, together with their residences and their
enjoyments. [F.266.a] In that instant, the bodhisattva and bodhisattvas as
numerous as the atoms in ten buddha realms who had the same prayer, the
same practice of conduct, the same roots of merit, the same displays; who
were dwelling in the same liberation, residing on the same level of wisdom,
coming forth through the same miraculous manifestations, accomplishing
the same prayers, coming forth through the same conduct; having purified
Dharma bodies and the powerful presence of a vast, centerless, endless
extent, of form bodies coming forth through the completely good
bodhisattva conduct, prayers, and miraculous manifestations, were seated in
the center of the precious kūṭāgāras of the lords of nāgas. The nāga king
Sāgara and eighty thousand other nāga kings and all lords of the world
made offerings to them.
44. 54
“They displayed the miraculous manifestations of passing away from all
the Tuṣita palaces, displayed taking birth from each Tuṣita into a four-
continent world throughout all the world realms, acted in accordance with
their skill in the inconceivable methods for ripening beings, inspired beings
who were careless, brought them up out of all attachments, spread a great

network of light rays that dispelled the darkness in all worlds, ended the
sufferings in all lower existences, prevented all existences in hells, invoked
the past karma of all beings, [F.266.b] protected all realms of beings, and
displayed their bodies to all beings.
44. 55
“Together they departed from their Tuṣita palaces and with their
entourages entered my body. All of them moved and walked within my
body, their steps ranging from being as wide as a great world realm of a
thousand million worlds up to being as wide as world realms as numerous
as the atoms in countless buddha realms.
44. 56
“The countless assembled entourages of bodhisattvas at the feet of
tathāgatas in all the vast extent of world realms in the ten directions in each
instant came into my body in order to see the miraculous manifestation of
the bodhisattva’s residence in the womb.
44. 57
“The Four Mahārājas, Śakra, Suyāma, Saṃtuṣita, Sunirmita, Vaśavartin, the
lords of the devas, and the lords of Brahmā devas also entered in order to see
the bodhisattva dwelling in a womb, to pay homage to him, honor him, and
hear him speak the Dharma. My womb, although it held all those assembled
entourages, did not become vast. My body was not different from an
ordinary human body, and yet it held all those assembled entourages.
44. 58
“All those devas and humans saw the bodhisattva’s various pure
enjoyments and displays. Why is that? Because I meditated on this
bodhisattva liberation called the illusory conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer.
44. 59
“Noble one, just as I held in my body the bodhisattva in the Jambudvīpa of
this fortunate four-continent world, [F.267.a] in the same way I have held
him in this miraculous manner in all the four-continent worlds of the great
world realm of a thousand million worlds. Because I have meditated on this
bodhisattva liberation called the illusory conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer,
my body is neither dual nor nondual, and it is neither single nor multiple.
44. 60
“Noble one, just as I have been the mother of this Buddha Vairocana, in
the same way I have been the mother of a vast extent, without middle or end,
of past tathāgatas. If a bodhisattva was born miraculously from the center of
a lotus, I was a goddess of that lotus bed, I acquired that bodhisattva, and I
was known in the world as being the bodhisattva’s mother. If a bodhisattva
was born upon my lap, I acquired them from my lap and was the
bodhisattva’s mother. If a bodhisattva were in that way born spontaneously
in a buddha realm, I would be living there as the goddess of the
bodhimaṇḍa.
44. 61
“Noble one, through various methods I became the mother of the
bodhisattvas when they appeared in various ways in the world as their last
existence as bodhisattvas.


---

44. 62
“Noble one, in this world realm I have been the mother who manifested
the miraculous bodhisattva birth of the Bhagavat Vairocana. In the same
way, I was the mother of the tathāgatas Krakucchanda, Kanaka muni, and
Kāśyapa. In the same way, I will be the mother of all the future tathāgatas in
this Bhadra kalpa. [F.267.b] Thus, when the time comes for the bodhisattva
Maitreya, who dwells in the Tuṣita palace, to manifest passing away, he will
radiate the light ray of the lights that reveal the miraculous event of the birth,
appearance, and dwelling in a womb of all bodhisattvas. The light will go
throughout the lands and ways of the entire realm of phenomena and will
manifest as that bodhisattva Maitreya who will be born in a human world in
the family of a lord of humans in all the lands and ways of the entire realm of
phenomena in order to guide beings, and I will be the mother of all those
bodhisattvas.
44. 63
“Just as I will be the mother of the bodhisattva Maitreya, in the same way,
after Maitreya’s attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment of
buddhahood, I will be the mother of Siṃha, Pradyota, Ketu, Sunetra,

“Noble one, in that way I will be the mother of all the future tathāgatas,
such as Maitreya and the others I have mentioned, and all the other
tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddhas of this Bhadra kalpa in this great world
realm of a thousand million worlds.

“As it is in this world realm, I will in the same way enter countless world
realms in the ten directions throughout the vast extent, without middle or

44. 66
“In the same way that I will be the mother, with countless special
qualities, of the Tathāgata Maitreya, [F.269.b] I will be the mother, with
countless numbers of countless special qualities, of the Tathāgata Siṃha,
and so on until the Tathāgata Roca.
44. 67
“Just as I am the mother of the tathāgatas of the Bhadra kalpa, in the same
way, in all the Jambudvīpas in all the world realms in the entirety of this
ocean of world realms called Kusuma tala garbha vyūhālaṃkāra, and in all the
world realms throughout the vast extent of world realms, until the last of
future kalpas, I will practice the completely good conduct of the bodhisattva
and be present in all kalpas in order to ripen and guide beings, and I will be
the mother of all the tathāgatas as bodhisattvas in the future.”
44. 68
After she had spoken, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, asked
Māyādevī, “Āryā, how long has it been since you attained this bodhisattva
liberation called the illusory conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer?”
44. 69
Māyādevī answered, “Noble one, in the past, in time gone by, countless
kalpas ago, beyond the scope of the mind, beyond kalpas that are beyond
the number that can be perceived and known by the vision of wise
bodhisattvas, there was a kalpa called Śubhaprabha. In that Śubhaprabha


---

kalpa there was a world realm called Merūdgataśrī, which was both pure
and defiled, formed from many jewels, and endowed with Cakravāla
mountain ranges, Sumeru mountains, and oceans, the five classes of beings,
and a variety of beauties. In that Merūdgataśrī world realm there were ten
thousand million four-continent worlds. [F.270.a] In the center of those ten
thousand million four-continent worlds was the central four-continent world
called Siṃha dhvajāgra tejas. In that four-continent world there were eighty
thousand million royal cities. In the center of those eighty thousand million
royal cities there was the central royal city, called Dhvajāgravatī, in which
there was a cakravartin king called Mahā tejaḥ parākrama. By that royal city of
Dhvajāgravatī there was a bodhimaṇḍa called Citra mañjari prabhāsa, where
dwelled a bodhimaṇḍa goddess by the name of Netraśrī.
44. 70
“In that bodhimaṇḍa called Citra mañjari prabhāsa, the bodhisattva Vimala-
dhvaja sat in order to realize omniscience. In order to prevent his realization
of omniscience, a māra by the name of Suvarṇaprabha, together with an
entourage of a great army of māras, made himself visible
 and came before
him.
1907
44. 71
“The cakravartin Mahā tejaḥ parākrama had attained the power of a
bodhisattva and displayed manifestations of great miraculous powers. He
manifested a great army that was far more numerous than the māra’s army,
and in order to defeat the māra’s army, it surrounded the bodhimaṇḍa and
scattered the great army of the māra. Then the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata
Vimala dhvaja, attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood.
44. 72
“Netraśrī, the bodhimaṇḍa goddess, looked upon the cakravartin king
Mahā tejaḥ parākrama as her son. [F.270.b] She bowed to the feet of the
Bhagavat and made this prayer: ‘Bhagavat, wherever I am reborn, may the
cakravartin Mahā tejaḥ parākrama always be my son! May I be his mother
when he attains the highest, complete enlightenment at buddhahood.’
44. 73
“She dwelled at the Citra mañjari prabhāsa bodhimaṇḍa serving a trillion
tathāgatas during the Śubhaprabha kalpa.
44. 74
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Netraśrī, the bodhimaṇḍa goddess? Noble one, do not think that it was
anyone else, for at that time, in that time, I was Netraśrī, the bodhimaṇḍa
goddess.
44. 75
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was the
cakravartin king Mahā tejaḥ parākrama, who had attained the power of a
bodhisattva, displayed manifestations of great miraculous powers, and
scattered the army of that māra? Do not think that it was anyone else, for at
that time, in that time, the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Vairocana
was Mahā tejaḥ parākrama, the cakravartin king.


---

44. 76
“Noble one, in that way, from that time onward, wherever I was reborn, in
all those lives he has been my son. Wherever he was reborn, practicing
bodhisattva conduct in all buddha realms, in all the entrances to roots of
merit, in all the ways of bodhisattva conduct, [F.271.a] in all the ways of
rebirth, in all lifetimes as a lord of devas, as a lord of the world, on the level of
a supreme deity, as a light among the classes of beings, wherever he was
reborn in order to ripen beings, in all those lifetimes I was his mother. In all
existences I have inseparably been his mother. I have been his mother in all
the miraculous bodhisattva births manifested in each instant through the
gateways of bodhisattva births.
44. 77
“I have been the mother of the immeasurable vast extent, without middle
or end, of the tathāgatas of the past. I am the mother of the immeasurable
vast extent, without middle or end, of the tathāgatas in the ten directions
who have appeared in the present time. In that way, I have been the mother
of a bodhisattva for all tathāgatas in their final lifetime, and from the navel of
all those tathāgatas shone many light rays that illuminated my body and
mind.
44. 78
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the illusory
conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer. How could I know or describe the
qualities of the bodhisattvas who possess the essence of great compassion,
who within themselves are never satisfied in ripening and guiding beings to
omniscience, and who manifest from the tips of their body hairs the
miraculous manifestations of all tathāgatas?
44. 79
“Depart, noble one. In the paradise of the lord of Trāyastriṃśa resides
Surendrābhā, the daughter of the deva Smṛtimat. [F.271.b] Go to her and ask
her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in and practice bodhisattva conduct?’ ”
44. 80
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
Māyādevī, circumambulated her many hundreds of thousands of times,
keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed from
Māyādevī. [B17]
