2183

2185
2186
56. 2
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, who was dedicated to that kind of
aspiration and attention, was saturated by previous roots of merit, was
blessed by the tathāgatas, and had the equivalent roots of merit in the past


---

as the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, and therefore there appeared ten omens
of the appearance of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra.
56. 3
What were those ten? They were that (1) all buddha realms were purified
through having pure adornments at the bodhimaṇḍas of all tathāgatas; (2) all
buddha realms were purified through the elimination of all their unfortunate
states, lower existences, and lower realms; (3) all buddha realms were
purified through becoming pure buddha realms with arrays of lotus
 beds;
(4) all buddha realms were purified through the bodies and minds of all their
beings becoming joyous and happy; (5) all buddha realms were purified
through becoming made of all precious materials; (6) all buddha realms were
purified through all their realms of beings becoming adorned by the signs
and features of a great being; (7) all buddha realms were purified through
being covered by clouds of adornments and decorations; (8) all buddha
realms were purified through all their beings having a nature that was
mutually loving, altruistic, and without malice; (9) all buddha realms were
purified through their bodhimaṇḍas becoming adorned by adornments; and
(10) all buddha realms were purified through all their beings becoming
dedicated to remembering and focusing on the buddhas. [F.347.a] Those
were the ten omens of the appearance of the bodhisattva mahāsattva
Samanta bhadra.
2187
56. 4
There also appeared ten lights that were omens of the appearance of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra.
What were those ten? They were that (1) from each atom of the atoms of all
world realms shone a multitude of nets of light rays from all tathāgatas; (2)
from each atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged a multitude of halos
of buddhas, some of a single color, some of various colors, some with many
hundreds of thousands of colors, spreading throughout the entire realm of
phenomena; (3) from each atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged
clouds of all jewels creating the perception of the images of all tathāgatas
spreading throughout the entire realm of phenomena; (4) from each atom of
the atoms of all world realms emerged wheels, and circles of the light
radiated from all tathāgatas spreading throughout the entire realm of
phenomena; (5) from each atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged a
multitude of clouds of perfume, flowers, garlands, ointments, and incense
that resounded with thunder from all the clouds that proclaimed the ocean of
the phenomena of the qualities of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra,
spreading throughout the entire realm of phenomena; [F.347.b] (6) from each
atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged multitudes of clouds of suns,
moons, and stars, emanating the light of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra,
spreading throughout the entire realm of phenomena; (7) from each atom of
the atoms of all world realms emerged multitudes of clouds of lamps in the


---

shapes of all bodies,
 shining like the light rays of buddhas and spreading
throughout the entire realm of phenomena; (8) from each atom of the atoms
of all world realms emerged multitudes of clouds of figures made of precious
jewels that represent the bodies of the tathāgatas, spreading throughout all
the world realms in the ten directions; (9) from each atom of the atoms of all
world realms emerged multitudes of clouds of figures made of light rays that
appeared in the forms of the bodies of all the tathāgatas, sending down rain
from the clouds of the blessings and prayers of all the buddhas and
spreading throughout the entire realm of phenomena; and (10) from each
atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged an ocean of clouds of the
images with the appearance of all kinds of forms of the bodies of
bodhisattvas, engaged in liberating
 all beings and accomplishing the
fulfillment of the Dharma aspirations of all beings and spreading throughout
the entire realm of phenomena. Those were the ten great lights that were
omens of the appearance of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samanta bhadra.
[F.348.a]
2188
2189
56. 5
When Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had seen those ten great lights
as omens, he gained the opportunity to see Samanta bhadra. He had the
support of his own roots of merit. He had the blessing of all the tathāgatas
and had given rise to the illumination of the Dharma of all the buddhas. He
was focused on the conduct of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. He was
blessed by the prayers of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. He aspired to the
range of conduct of all the tathāgatas. He had attained the strength and
power of certainty in the immense field of activity of the bodhisattva. He
thought that seeing the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra would be the same as
attaining omniscience. His faculties were directed to seeing the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra. He had gained the great power of diligence for seeing the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. He applied himself with unflagging diligence
in seeking the sight of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra.
56. 6
With the wheel of his faculties facing in all directions; with the body of a
bodhisattva that has reached the all-seeing
 range of perception; with a
mind fixed on the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra as being present at the feet of
all buddhas without exception; with a focus on all buddhas as the object of
his perception; with an aspiration that never ceased to seek the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra as an object of perception; with the eyes of wisdom that
follow the path of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra having as their essence
the idea of seeing the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra; with an aspiration that
was as vast as space; [F.348.b] with a higher motivation that possessed the
thunderbolt of great compassion; with the prayer
 to follow the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra; with the blessing that lasts till the last of future
kalpas; with the pure power of ascension; by following the same conduct as
2190
2191


---

that of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra; by dwelling
 in the wisdom that is
established on the level of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra; by residing in the
field of perception of all tathāgatas; and by possessing
 those qualities, he
saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, who had attained equality with all
tathāgatas, who followed the three times equally, who possessed an
inconceivable field of perception, who had an inviolable conduct, who had a
limitless field of perception of wisdom, who was looked upon by all
bodhisattvas, who could not be surpassed by all worlds, who was followed
by all assemblies of followers, and who possessed a superior field of
perception.
2192
2193
56. 7
He was seated on a great precious lotus on the center of a lion throne in
front of the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha, the Bhagavat Vairocana,
with an ocean of an assembly of bodhisattva followers, at the head of a
gathering of bodhisattvas.
56. 8
He saw that from all the pores on his body, from each of those pores,
emerged multitudes of clouds of light rays that illuminated all world realms
throughout the extent of the realm of phenomena to its limits and brought an
end to the suffering of beings. [F.349.a]
56. 9
He saw him increasing the vast power of joy and aspiration in all
bodhisattvas.
56. 10
He saw emanating from the crown of his head, his two shoulders, and all
his pores a multitude of clouds of perfumes and lights of various colors,
which spread throughout the assemblies of the followers of all tathāgatas
and let fall their rain.
56. 11

He saw that from all the pores on his body, from each of those pores,
emerged clouds of streamers of silks in various colors, clouds of various
garlands, clouds of various pearls, [F.349.b] and clouds of wish-fulfilling
precious jewels, which were as numerous as the atoms in all buddha realms
and which spread throughout the assemblies of the followers of all
tathāgatas and let fall their rain.
56. 15
He saw that from all the pores on his body, from each of those pores, in
order to fulfill the wishes of all beings, there emerged clouds of jewel trees,

space to its limits, adorning the buddha realms with treasures of jewels
emanated from the jewel trees and spreading throughout the assemblies of

entire desire realm, who held many wheels of Dharma of all the tathāgatas.
56. 19
He saw that from all the pores on his body, from each of those pores, there
emerged, with each instant of mind, clouds of buddha realms that resembled
all the buddha realms within the three times [F.350.a] and were as numerous
as the atoms in all buddha realms, and they spread throughout the realm of
phenomena, throughout the entire realm of space to its limits, becoming a
dwelling, a refuge, and a basis for beings without a dwelling, without a
refuge, and without a basis.
56. 20
He saw that from all the pores on his body, from each of those pores, there
emerged, with each instant of mind, clouds filled with pure buddha realms,
the appearances of buddhas, and all the assemblies of bodhisattva followers,
which were as numerous as the atoms in all buddha realms, spreading

its limits, accomplishing the purification of beings with powerful aspirations.
56. 21
He saw that from all the pores on his body, from each of those pores, there

56. 24

---

56. 29
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was overjoyed, pleased, delighted,
thrilled, and blissful on seeing the scope of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s
miracles, and he contempleted the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s body even
more strongly.
56. 30
In each of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s limbs, in each section of his
limbs, in each part of his body, in each section of the parts of his body, in
each side of his limbs, in each section of the sides of his limbs, in each
form,
 in each section of each form, in each pore, and in each section of
each pore, he saw the images of this billion-world world realm with its mass
of air, its mass of water, its mass of earth, its mass of fire, its oceans, its
continents, its rivers, its mountains of jewels, its Sumerus, its Cakravālas, its
villages, towns, districts, regions, realms, and royal capitals, its forests, its
houses, [F.351.b] its populations, its hells, its animal existences, its Yama
realms, its asura realms, its nāga realms, its deva realms, its Brahmā realms,
its range of desire realms, its range of form realms, its range of formless
realms, its ground, its foundations, its shapes, its clouds, its lightning, its
stars, its days and nights, its fortnights, its months, its seasons, its years, its
intermediate kalpas, and its kalpas.
2194
56. 31
Just as he saw this world realm, he saw the images of all the world realms
in the eastern direction. Just as he saw those in the eastern direction, he also
saw the world realms in the southern direction, in the western direction, in
the northern direction, in the northeastern direction, in the southeastern
direction, in the southwestern direction, in the northwestern direction, and
in the downward and upward directions, together with their appearances of
buddhas and their assemblies of bodhisattva followers.
56. 32
He also saw all the past successions of worlds in this Sahā world realm in
each of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s physical signs of a great being,
[F.352.a] together with their appearances of buddhas, all their assemblies of
bodhisattva followers, all their beings, all their houses, all their days and
nights, and all their kalpas. In the same way, he saw the entire vast extent of
its future buddha realms.
56. 33
Just as he saw the past and future of this world realm, in that way he saw
the succession of all world realms.
56. 34
In the same way, he saw the past and future successive world realms of all
world realms in the ten directions in the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s body,
and in each of his physical signs of a great being and in each pore, all
distinctly and not mixed with one another.
56. 35
In the same way that he saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra manifesting
this play of being seated on a great precious lotus on the center of a lion
throne in front of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Vairocana, in the same way he


---

saw him manifesting this same play in the eastern direction in the world
realm Padmaśrī of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Bhadra śrī.
56. 36
In the same way as in the eastern direction, he saw the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra manifesting this play of being seated on a great precious
lotus on the center of a lion throne in front of all the tathāgatas of all the
world realms in the principal and intermediate directions. [F.352.b]
56. 37
In the same way that he saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra manifesting
this display of being seated on a great precious lotus on the center of a lion
throne in front of all the tathāgatas in all the world realms in the ten
directions, he saw, in the atoms of all the buddha realms in the ten
directions, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra manifesting this display of being
seated on a great precious lotus upon the center of a lion throne in front of
all the tathāgatas within an assembly of followers of the Buddha, as vast as
the realm of phenomena, in each atom.
56. 38
He saw in each of those bodies the manifestation of reflections of all
objects of perception in the three times.
56. 39
He saw the manifestation of the perceptions as reflections of all realms, all
beings, all appearances of buddhas, and all the assemblies of bodhisattva
followers.
56. 40
He heard the sounds of all beings, the voices of all buddhas, the Dharma
wheels of all tathāgatas, and all the miraculous manifestations of the
teaching of instructions.
56. 41
Having seen and heard in that way the play
 of the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra’s liberation, he attained the ten practices of the perfection of
knowledge.
2195
56. 42
What are those ten? [F.353.a] (1) He attained the practice of the perfection
of knowledge of filling all buddha realms with his body in each instant of
mind; (2) he attained the practice of the perfection of knowledge of going
into the presence of all tathāgatas without differentiation; (3) he attained the
practice of the perfection of knowledge of serving and making offerings to
all tathāgatas; (4) he attained the practice of the perfection of knowledge of
the attainment of acquiring all the Dharmas of the buddhas from all
tathāgatas and from each tathāgata; (5) he attained the practice of the
perfection of knowledge of the definitive understanding of the Dharma
wheels of all tathāgatas; (6) he attained the practice of the perfection of
knowledge of the inconceivable miracles of the buddhas; (7) he attained the
practice of the perfection of knowledge of an unceasing discernment of all
Dharmas,
 which is steadfast until the last of future kalpas, through the
teaching of a single word of the Dharma; (8) he attained the practice of the
perfection of knowledge that directly perceives the entire ocean
 of the
Dharma; (9) he attained the practice of the perfection of knowledge that
2196
2197


---

manifests within the perceptions of all beings; and (10) he attained the
practice of the perfection of knowledge that directly perceives the conduct of
the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra in each instant of mind. [F.353.b]
56. 43
The bodhisattva Samanta bhadra extended his right hand and placed it
upon the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, who possessed such a
practice of the perfection of knowledge.
56. 44
The instant that the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra placed his right hand
upon the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, he entered as many
samādhi gateways as there are atoms in all buddha realms. In each samādhi
he realized the sight of an ocean of world realms, as numerous as the atoms
in a buddha realm, which he had never seen before. He gathered as many
accumulations of omniscience as there are atoms in a buddha realm. There
came as many accumulations of the Dharmas of omniscience as there are
atoms in a buddha realm. He arose to as many great establishments in
omniscience as there are atoms in a buddha realm. He comprehended an
ocean of prayers as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm. He set out
along paths that have arisen from omniscience, which were as numerous as
the atoms in a buddha realm. He entered into as many bodhisattva conducts
as there are atoms in a buddha realm. He increased as many powers of
omniscience as there are atoms in a buddha realm. He illuminated with as
many illuminations from the knowledge of all buddhas as there are atoms in
a buddha realm. [F.354.a]
56. 45
Just as the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, at the feet of the Bhagavat, the
Tathāgata Vairocana in this Sahā world realm, extended his right hand and
placed it upon the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, in the same
way, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra at the feet of the tathāgatas in all world
realms extended his right hand and placed it upon the head of Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son. In the same way, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra at
the feet of all the tathāgatas within the atoms of all world realms in all the
principal and intermediate directions extended his right hand and placed it
upon the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
56. 46
Just as Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, entered many Dharma
gateways when touched by the hand of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra at
the feet of the Bhagavat Vairocana, in the same way Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, entered in many ways many Dharma gateways when
touched by the clouds of hands emanated from all the bodies of Samanta-
bhadra.
56. 47
Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samanta bhadra said to Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, “Noble one, you have seen my miraculous
manifestations.”


---

Sudhana said, “Ārya, I have seen them. The inconceivable liberations that
I have seen can only be known by the knowledge of a tathāgata.” [F.354.b]
56. 48
Samanta bhadra said, “Noble one, I long for the omniscient mind and have
practiced for as many kalpas as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of
buddha realms.
56. 49
“In each of those great kalpas, I purified the aspiration for enlightenment,
and 
I 
served 
as 
many 
tathāgatas 
as 
there 
are 
atoms 
in 
an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
56. 50
“In each of those great kalpas, I accumulated the merit for omniscience
and engaged in all the great giving of gifts and offerings. I held bestowals of
gifts and offerings that were proclaimed throughout the world and were
bestowed upon all beings.
56. 51
“In each of those great kalpas, aspiring to the Dharmas of omniscience, I
gave gifts, great gifts, and extreme gifts that were as numerous as the atoms
in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
56. 52
“In each of those great kalpas, without concern for body and life, and
cherishing the Dharma of the buddhas, I gave away bodies as numerous as
the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms. I gave away great
kingdoms. I gave away villages, towns, regions, lands, realms, and royal
capitals. I gave away gatherings of entourages that were beautiful and
pleasing and that I could not part with. I gave away sons, daughters, and
wives. I gave away my body and flesh. I gave the blood from my body to
those who asked for it. I gave away my bones and marrow. [F.355.a] I gave
away my legs and arms. I gave away the greater and smaller parts of my
body. I gave away my nose and ears. I gave away my eyes. I gave away the
organ of my tongue from my mouth.
56. 53
“In each of those great kalpas, aspiring for the head of omniscience that is
above and higher than all worlds, I gave away my own head as many times
as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
56. 54
“As it was in each of those great kalpas, it was the same in each of an
ocean of kalpas as numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of
buddha realms, in which through becoming a supreme lord I served,
honored, and venerated tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms, making offerings to them and giving
them clothing, food, beds, medicines when ill, and necessary utensils. I
entered homelessness in the teachings of those tathāgatas, following all
their instructions, and held their teachings.
56. 55
“Noble one, throughout the ocean of that many kalpas, I developed an
aspiration solely for the teaching of the tathāgatas and do not remember ever
developing an inappropriate aspiration. Throughout the ocean of that many
kalpas, I developed solely that aspiration, and I do not remember developing

an aspiration through anger, an aspiration through fixation on the self, an
aspiration from protecting and grasping a self, [F.355.b] an aspiration that
made a distinction between self and others, or an aspiration that was not
connected with the path to enlightenment, nor do I remember developing an
aspiration that became wearied or disheartened or confused by obscurations
through remaining in saṃsāra. Instead, I developed the aspiration for
gathering the accumulations for omniscience, an aspiration that had an
invincible knowledge and unconquerable essence.
56. 56
“Noble one, it is like this: an ocean of kalpas would pass if I were to teach
my past perfect practices, my engagement in purifying buddha realms, my
engagement in protecting, ripening, and purifying beings with my
attainment of great compassion, my engagement in making offerings to and
serving buddhas, my engagement in serving gurus in order to seek the good
Dharma, my engagement in giving away my body in order to obtain the
good Dharma, and my engagement in giving up my life in order to protect
the good Dharma.
56. 57
“Noble one, there is not one word or letter from all that ocean of the
Dharma for which I did not give up the kingdom of a cakravartin or all my
possessions through being dedicated to saving all beings, dedicated to
attaining definitive understanding of the continuum of my mind, dedicated
to others hearing the Dharma, dedicated to the elucidation of the light of
worldly knowledge, dedicated to the elucidation of all world-transcending
knowledge, [F.356.a] dedicated to giving rise to happiness in saṃsāra for all
beings, and dedicated to praising the qualities of all the tathāgatas. In that
way, an ocean of kalpas as numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya
of buddha realms would pass by if I were to teach my perfect practices in the
past.
56. 58
“Noble one, in that way, I attained the pure Dharma body that is
undifferentiated by the three times through the strength of such
accumulations, through the strength of the accumulation of the causal roots
of merit, through the strength of a vast aspiration, through the strength of
practicing the qualities, through the strength of correctly comprehending all
Dharmas, through the strength of the eyes of wisdom, through the strength
of the blessing of the tathāgatas, through the strength of great prayers,
through the strength of great compassion, through the strength of perfectly
purified higher cognitions, and through the strength of being taken into the
care of the kalyāṇamitras. I also purified the unsurpassable form body that
transcends all worlds, that is perceived by all beings according to their
aspirations, that is spread throughout all buddha realms, that is present
everywhere, that manifests all miracles in every place, and that is attractive
to all beings.
 [F.356.b]

56. 59
“Noble one, regard this perfect body I have attained, which has been
accomplished through an endless ocean of kalpas and which is rare to
appear and rare to see in many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of
kalpas.
56. 60
“Noble one, those beings who have not developed roots of merit cannot
hear me, let alone see me.
56. 61
“Noble one, those beings who just hear my name become irreversible in
their progress toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Those who just
see me, touch me, accompany me, follow me, see me in a dream, or hear my
name in a dream become irreversible in their progress toward the highest,
complete enlightenment.
56. 62
“Some, through thinking of me, become ripened in one day, some in one
week, some in a fortnight, some in a month, some in a year, some in a
hundred years, some in a kalpa, some in a hundred kalpas, and some in as
many kalpas as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
Some become ripened after as many lifetimes as there are atoms in an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms. Some become ripened through
seeing my light, some through seeing the light rays I radiate, [F.357.a] some
through the realm shaking, some through the manifestation of my form
body, and some through rejoicing in it.
56. 63
“Noble one, in that way, through as many methods as there are atoms in a
buddha realm, beings become irreversible in their progress toward the
highest, complete enlightenment.
56. 64
“Noble one, the beings who hear
 of my pure buddha realm will be
reborn in pure buddha realms. Those who see my pure body will be reborn
with a body like mine. Therefore, noble one, look at my body.”
2199
56. 65
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplated the body of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra and saw an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of oceans of
buddha realms in each pore. He saw in each of those oceans of realms
tathāgatas encircled by oceans of assemblies of bodhisattvas. He saw all
those oceans of realms as having various grounds, various shapes, various
arrays, and various Cakravāla mountain ranges, covered by various clouds
and various skies, and possessing various appearances of buddhas and the
sound of various Dharma wheels.
56. 66
What he saw in each pore he saw in all pores without exception, in all the
physical signs and features of a great being, and in all the greater and
smaller parts of the body. He saw clouds of emanations of bodies of
buddhas, as numerous as the atoms in all buddha realms, appearing in each
of the oceans of realms, pervading all the world realms in the ten directions,
[F.357.b] and ripening beings for the highest, complete enlightenment.


---

56. 67
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having been taught the instructions
and teachings of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, entered all the world
realms that were within the body of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra and
ripened beings.
56. 68
The roots of merit accumulated by Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
through the light of knowledge by coming before, seeing, and honoring as
many kalyāṇamitras as there are atoms in a buddha realm, were not a
hundredth of the roots of merit accumulated by seeing the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra; they were not even a thousandth, were not even a trillionth,
and could not even be an enumeration, a fraction, a number, an analogy, or a
basis
 for it.
2200
56. 69
However many successions of oceans of buddha realms Sudhana
apprehended from first developing the aspiration for enlightenment until he
saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, he apprehended in each instant of
mind even more successions of oceans of buddha realms, as many
 as
there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms, in each of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s pores. Just as it was in each of his pores, so it
was in all his pores without exception, and even if in each instant of mind
Sudhana were to arrive at world realms as numerous as the atoms in an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms
 and continue spreading through
world realms until the last of future kalpas, he would still not reach the end
of those successions of oceans of buddha realms. [F.358.a] He would not
reach the end of the forms
 of the oceans of realms, the particulars of the
oceans of realms, the groupings of the oceans of realms, the origination of
the oceans of realms, the destruction of the oceans of realms, the categories
of the oceans of realms, the succession of the oceans of the appearances of
buddhas, the bodies of the oceans of the appearances of buddhas, the
particulars of the oceans of the appearances of buddhas, the groupings of
the oceans of the appearances of buddhas, the originations of the oceans of
the appearances of buddhas, the destruction of the oceans of the
appearances of buddhas, the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the successions of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the particulars of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the groupings of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the origination of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the destruction of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the entries into the realms of beings, the entries in each instant
into the knowledge of the faculties of beings, the realizations of the
knowledge of the faculties of beings, the ripening and guiding of beings, or
the practices of the profound bodhisattva miracles and would not reach the
end of the ocean of the ascending of bodhisattva bhūmis.

He was active in some realms for a kalpa. He was active in some realms for
as many kalpas as there are atoms
 in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of realms,
and he did not depart from those realms. [F.358.b] In each instant of mind, he
ripened beings for the highest, complete enlightenment in a vast extent of an
ocean of realms with no end or middle, until in that way he eventually
attained equality with the ocean of the prayers and the conduct of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. He attained equality with all the tathāgatas,
equality with their pervasion of all realms by their bodies, equality with their
fulfillment of conduct, equality with their manifesting the miraculous
manifestation of the attainment of complete buddhahood, equality with their
turning the wheel of the Dharma, equality with their pure discernment,
equality with the utterances of their voices, equality with the engagement in
the oceans of all the aspects of their voices, equality with their great love and
great compassion, and equality with the miraculous manifestation of the
inconceivable liberations of the bodhisattvas.
2204
56. 71
The bodhisattva mahāsattva Samanta bhadra then composed these verses
in order to further elucidate kalpas, the vast extent of kalpas, and world
realms as numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha
realms:
56. 72
However many
 lions among men there are
2205
In the three times, in the worlds in the ten directions,
I pay homage to them all without exception,
With purity of body, speech, and mind. {1} [F.359.a]
56. 73
Thinking that all the jinas are before me,
With the power of the prayer of good conduct,
I bow down toward all the jinas
With as many bodies as there are atoms in the realms.
 {2}
2206
56. 74
There are as many buddhas as atoms within a single atom,
Seated in the midst of bodhisattvas.2207
I focus on the entire realm of phenomena,
Without exception, being filled by jinas in that way. {3}
56. 75
I recite a praise of all the sugatas,
Enumerating the qualities of all the jinas,
With unending oceans of eulogies
And the sound of oceans of every quality of voice. {4}
56. 76
I make an offering to those jinas
Of perfect flowers, perfect garlands,
Perfect music, ointments, and parasols,


---

Perfect lights, and perfect incenses. {5}
56. 77
I make offerings to those jinas
Of perfect clothing and perfect perfumes,
Pouches of scented powders equal to Mount Meru,
And all perfect, sublime displays. {6}
56. 78
Offerings that are unsurpassable and exalted
I am resolved to offer to all the jinas.
I praise and make offerings to all the jinas
Through the power of devotion
 to good conduct. {7}
2208
56. 79
Whatever bad actions I have done
Under the power of desire, anger, and ignorance,
With my body, speech, and mind,
I make a confession of them all. {8}
56. 80
I am rejoicing in the entirety of merit
In the ten directions that is created by beings,
By practicing and accomplished pratyeka buddhas,2209
By the bodhisattvas, and by all the jinas.
 {9}
2210
56. 81
I make the request to all the lords,
The lamps of the worlds in the ten directions,
Who have attained without impediment the enlightenment of buddhahood,
That they turn the unsurpassable wheel. {10}
56. 82
With palms placed together, I supplicate
Those who wish to manifest passing into nirvāṇa
That they remain for as many kalpas as there are atoms in the realms,
For the benefit and happiness of all beings. {11} [F.359.b]
56. 83
Whatever little virtue
 I have accumulated
2211
Through homage, offering, confession,
Rejoicing, supplication, and entreating,
I dedicate it all to enlightenment. {12}
56. 84
May the buddhas of the past and those who are present
In the worlds of the ten directions be offered to.
May those in the future swiftly fulfill
Their aspirations for the enlightenment of buddhahood. {13}
56. 85
May the realms that are in the ten directions
Become purified and sublime.2212
May they become filled with jinas, who have come


---

To the Bodhi tree, the lord of trees, and with bodhisattvas. {14}
56. 86
However many beings there are in the ten directions,
May they all be always happy and healthy.
May all beings be successful in their Dharma goals,
And may their wishes be fulfilled. {15}
56. 87
May I practice the conduct of enlightenment
And remember my lives in all existences.
May I always practice mendicancy
In all my lifetimes of deaths and rebirths. {16}
56. 88
Following the teaching of all the jinas
And perfecting my good conduct,
May I always practice stainless, pure,
Correct conduct that is flawless and unblemished. {17}
56. 89
May I teach the Dharma in all languages,
Whatever the languages of beings:
Through the languages of devas, the languages of nāgas,
The languages of yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and humans. {18}
56. 90
May one who is gentle
 and dedicated to the perfections
2213
Never forget the aspiration to enlightenment.
May the obscurations of bad karma
Be purified without any remainder. {19}
56. 91
May my conduct, even in the worldly existences,
Be free of karma, kleśas, and the actions
 of Māra,
2214
Just as the lotus is unstained by water
And the sun and moon are unobstructed in the sky. {20} [F.360.a]
56. 92
May I end all the sufferings of lower existences
And establish all beings in happiness,
Practicing a conduct that brings benefit to all beings
Throughout the directions and the extent
 of realms. {21}
2215
56. 93
May I practice this conduct in all future kalpas,
Conforming with the conduct of beings,
Perfecting the conduct of enlightenment,
And teaching good conduct.
 {22}
2216
56. 94
May I always be in the company of those
Whose conduct is in harmony with my conduct.
May my body, my speech, and also my mind


---

Practice the same conduct and have the same prayer.
 {23}
2217
56. 95
May I always associate
With friends who wish to benefit me
And teach me the correct conduct,
And may I never displease them. {24}
56. 96
May I always see before me the jinas,
The lords who are encircled by bodhisattvas,
And may I make vast
 offerings to them,
2218
Without wearying, throughout all future kalpas. {28}
56. 97
Keeping the good Dharma of the jinas,
Expounding
 the conduct of enlightenment,
2219
And purifying the good conduct,
May I practice that conduct in all future kalpas. {26}
56. 98
While circling through all existences,
May I obtain inexhaustible merit and knowledge.
May I be
 an inexhaustible treasure of wisdom,
2220
Methods, samādhis, liberations, and all good qualities. {27}
56. 99
There are realms as numerous as atoms in each atom,
And while practicing the conduct of enlightenment,
May I see in those realms countless buddhas
Who are seated in the midst of bodhisattvas. {28}
56. 100
May I engage in practicing conduct for an ocean of kalpas
Within every hair’s breadth in every direction,
Without exception, in which there are an ocean
Of buddhas of the three times, and an ocean of realms. {29} [F.360.b]
56. 101
May I always comprehend
 the speech of the buddhas,
2221
Which, through having an ocean of languages in a single syllable,
Has the purity of the aspects of the speech of all the jinas
And words that accord with the aspirations of all beings.
 {30}
2222
56. 102
May I comprehend, through the power of the mind,
The unceasing sounds of the voices
Of the jinas in
 the three times,
2223
Who are turning the wheel in various ways.
 {31}
2224
56. 103
May I enter all the future kalpas,
Entering them in a single instant,
And in a fraction of an instant practice


---

The conduct throughout the kalpas of the three times. {32}
56. 104
May I in a single instant see
The lions among humans in
 the three times.
2225
Through the power of the liberation of being an illusion,
May I always enter into their conduct. {33}
56. 105
May the displays of realms in the three times
Be accomplished within a single atom.
May I perceive such displays of the realms of the jinas
That are in every direction without exception. {34}
56. 106
May I go into the presence of all those lords,
Those future lamps of the world, who will successively
Attain enlightenment, turn the wheel,
And demonstrate the final peace of entering nirvāṇa. {35}
56. 107
Through the power of miracles that has complete speed,
Through the power of yānas
 that possesses every gateway,
2226
Through the power of conduct that has the complete qualities,
Through the power of love that is universal, {36}
56. 108
Through the power of merit that has complete goodness,
Through the power of knowledge that is without impediment,
Through the power of wisdom, methods, and samādhi,
May I accomplish the power of enlightenment. {37}
56. 109
May I purify the power of karma,
Destroy the power of the kleśas,
Render powerless the power of the māras,
And make complete all the powers of good conduct. {38}
56. 110
May I purify an ocean of realms, [F.361.a]
Liberate an ocean of beings,
See an ocean of the Dharma,
And realize
 an ocean of knowledge. {39}
2227
56. 111
May I purify an ocean of conduct,
Fulfill an ocean of prayers,
Make offerings to an ocean of buddhas,
And have tireless conduct for an ocean of kalpas. {40}
56. 112
May I, through good conduct, realize enlightenment
And fulfill, without exception,
All the specific prayers of enlightened conduct


---

That are made by the jinas in the three times. {41}
56. 113
I dedicate all this virtue
So that I may have the same conduct as that wise one,
The eldest son of all the jinas,
Whose name is Samanta bhadra.
 {42}
2228
56. 114
Just as the good wise one made a dedication
For a pure body, speech, and mind,
A pure conduct, and a pure realm,
May it be the same for me. {43}
56. 115
May I practice the conduct of Mañjuśrī’s prayer
For good conduct, for complete goodness,
Without weariness throughout the kalpas to come.
May I complete all those activities without exception. {44}
56. 116
May there be no limit to that conduct;
May there be no limit to those good qualities,
And having maintained a conduct that has no limit,
May I give rise to all those miraculous powers. {45}
56. 117
If there were an end to space,
There would be an end to all beings.
Only when their karma and kleśas end
Will my prayers also come to an end. {46}
56. 118
If someone offered to the jinas the endless realms
In the ten directions adorned with jewels
And the most excellent pleasures of devas and humans
For kalpas as numerous as the atoms in a realm, {47}
56. 119
Someone who has faith just once
On hearing this king of dedications
And aspires to attain perfect enlightenment
Will have a higher, superior merit. {48} [F.361.b]
56. 120
Whoever recites this prayer for good conduct
Will be free from all
 lower existences,
2229
Will be free from bad companions,
And will quickly see Amitābha. {49}
56. 121
They will have in this life the good fortune
Of obtaining success, a happy life,
And will soon become


---

The same as Samanta bhadra. {50}
56. 122
If someone through the power of ignorance
Has the bad karma of the five actions with immediate results,
They will be purified of it, without any remainder
Through reciting this prayer for good conduct. {51}
56. 123
They will have the wisdom, form,
Features, family, and color,
Be invincible to hosts of māras and tīrthikas,
And be offered to by the entire three realms. {52}
56. 124
They will soon go to the Bodhi tree, the lord of trees,
And having reached there be seated for the benefit of beings,
Become enlightened in buddhahood, turn the wheel of the Dharma,
And overpower Māra and his entire army. {53}
56. 125
The Buddha knows the result that ripens
For the one who possesses, recites,
Or teaches this prayer for good conduct.
Do not doubt the supreme enlightenment! {57}
56. 126
Just as the hero Mañjuśrī knows,
In that way
 so does Samanta bhadra.
2230
2231
In practicing in the same way as they do,
I am dedicating all this merit. {55}
56. 127
With the prayer that is praised as supreme
By all the jinas in the three times,
I am dedicating all this merit
For the supreme good conduct. {56}
56. 128
When the time has come for me to die,
May I dispel all obscurations,
See Amitābha before me,
And go to the Sukhāvatī realm. {57}
56. 129
When I have gone there, may these prayers [F.362.a]
All become completely manifest.
May I fulfill them all without exception
And benefit beings for as long as there are worlds. {58}
56. 130
May I be born from a beautiful, perfect lotus
In that pleasant, beautiful circle of the jinas,
And there obtain my prophecy


---

Directly from the Jina Amitābha. {59}
56. 131
Having obtained there the prophecy,
May I through the power of mind
Bring many benefits to beings in the ten directions
Through many billions of emanations. {60}
56. 132
May what little merit I have accumulated
Through reciting the good conduct prayer
Cause the virtuous prayers of beings
All to be fulfilled in an instant. {61}
56. 133
Through the sublime, endless merit attained
By my dedicating the good conduct,
May the beings drowning in a river of suffering
Depart to the supreme residence of Amitābha. {62}
56. 134
The compilation of Sudhana’s conduct of honoring kalyāṇamitras from the great
Dharma teaching entitled “Stem Array” from within the “Bodhisattva piṭaka,” “The
Mahāvaipulya Sūtra Entitled ‘A Multitude of Buddhas,’ ” is concluded.
56. 135
This concludes the episodes of Sudhana’s conduct of honoring kalyāṇamitras from the
great Dharma teaching, “The Stem Array.”
