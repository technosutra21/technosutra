STHĀVARĀ
33. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, eventually reached the goddess of
the earth, Sthāvarā, in the land of Magadha’s bodhimaṇḍa. When he arrived
there, one million earth goddesses proclaimed to one another, “Someone
who will be a refuge for all beings is coming here! Someone who has the
essence of the tathāgatas and who will break open the enclosing egg of
ignorance of all beings is coming here! Someone who is in the family of the
kings of Dharma and will attain the state of an unimpeded, stainless king of
the Dharma is coming here! Someone who is a hero with the thunderbolt
weapon that has the great power of wisdom and who will subdue the circle
of opponents is coming here!”
33. 2
At that moment, Sthāvarā and the other one million earth goddesses shook
the great earth, caused a loud sound like deep thunder, and illuminated the
world realm of a billion worlds with a vast light. Their bodies were adorned
by all adornments and precious jewelry. They shone and moved in the sky
like a mass of streaks of lightning.
33. 3
They rose up out of the ground, causing the seedlings of all trees to
sprout; causing all flowering trees to blossom; causing all rivers to flow;
causing lakes, ponds, and reservoirs to rise; causing a great rain of scented
water to fall; causing a great wind that scattered a cloud of flowers to blow;
causing a quintillion musical instruments to sound; [F.78.a] causing a
multitude of divine aerial palaces and ornaments to spread; causing the lords
of cows, bulls, elephants, tigers, and deer to make their cries; causing the
leaders of devas, asuras, nāgas,
 and bhūtas to roar; causing the great
lords of mountains to clash together; and causing trillions of masses of
treasures to emerge.

33. 4
Then the earth goddess Sthāvarā said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, “Noble one, it is excellent that you have come here.
 This area is
where in the past you dwelled and generated roots of merit, where I am the

witness for that. Do you wish to see just a fraction of their ripening?”
33. 5
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the earth
goddess Sthāvarā. He circumambulated the earth goddess Sthāvarā many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right. Then he stood
before her and, with his hands placed together in homage, said, “Āryā, I do
wish it!”
33. 6
Then the earth goddess Sthāvarā stamped on the ground with the sole of
her foot and revealed an array of countless millions of millions of precious
treasures and said, “Noble one, these millions of millions of precious
treasures follow you. They go before you. You can use them as you like. They
come from the ripening of your merit. They are protected by the power of
your merit. You can take from among them whatever you need.
33. 7
“Noble one, moreover, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
essence of invincible wisdom. [F.78.b] Through my possessing this bodhisattva
liberation, since the time of the Tathāgata Dīpaṅkara I have constantly
followed bodhisattvas and always protected them. Since that time, noble one,
I have practiced the mental conduct of the bodhisattvas, been immersed
within the scope of wisdom, entered the domain of prayer, realized pure
bodhisattva conduct, followed the ways of all samādhis, permeated the vast
motivations and higher cognitions of all bodhisattvas, and realized,
possessed, and acquired mastery of the powers of all bodhisattvas, the
pervasion of the network of all realms, the acquisition of prophecies from all
the tathāgatas, the sight at all times of the attainment of buddhahood, all the
ways of turning the wheel of the Dharma, all the ways of the clouds of
Dharma that elucidate the sūtras, the way of illumination by the great
radiance of the Dharma, the way of completely ripening all beings, and the
way of the display of all the miraculous manifestations of the buddhas.
33. 8
“Noble one, I received this bodhisattva liberation, the essence of invincible
wisdom, far beyond and even more beyond as many past kalpas as there are
atoms in Sumeru, during a kalpa called Avabhāsa vyūha, in a world realm
called Candra dhvajā, from the Tathāgata Sunetra. [F.79.a]
33. 9
“Noble one, in that way, until this Bhadra kalpa, while cultivating,
practicing,
 increasing, and augmenting this bodhisattva liberation called
the essence of invincible wisdom, I have never been deprived of the sight of the
tathāgatas.
1282
1283
33. 10
“During that time, I have propitiated as many tathāgata arhat samyak-
saṃbuddhas as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
I have seen the miraculous manifestation of all those tathāgatas going to the
bodhimaṇḍa. I have witnessed the roots of merit of all those tathāgatas.

33. 11
“Noble one, I know only the bodhisattva liberation called the essence of
invincible wisdom. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
bodhisattvas who attend all tathāgatas, who follow the teaching of all
buddhas, who enter into the impenetrable wisdom of the tathāgatas, who
have the power to pervade the entire realm of phenomena in one instant of
mind, who have bodies that are the same as those of the tathāgatas, who
have the essence of the stainless intention of all the buddhas, who always
realize all appearances of buddhas, and who are emissaries inseparable from
the activity
 of the buddhas?
1284
33. 12
“Depart, noble one. In this Jambudvīpa, in the land of Magadha, in the city
of Kapilavastu, is the goddess of the night named Vāsantī. [F.79.b] Go to her
and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How
should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
33. 13
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
earth goddess Sthāvarā, circumambulated the earth goddess Sthāvarā many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back
again and again, departed from the earth goddess Sthāvarā.
