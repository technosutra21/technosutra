MAÑJUŚRĪ
3. 1
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was residing
 in his kūṭāgāra together with
bodhisattvas who had the same conduct; vajrapāṇis who constantly
followed him; devas with physical bodies whose minds aspired to serve all
the buddhas and were dedicated to bringing power to the entire world;
devas who walked on foot following their past aspirations; devas of the
earth who aspired to hear the Dharma; devas of pools, lakes, ponds,
reservoirs, wells, and rivers who were dedicated to great compassion;
[F.314.a] devas of fire who brought illumination through the light of wisdom;
devas of the air who wore precious crowns; devas of the directions who
illuminated the directions with wisdom; devas of the night who were
dedicated to eliminating the darkness of ignorance; devas of the day who
were dedicated to producing the daylight of the tathāgatas; devas of the sky
who were dedicated to orbiting
 in the sky of the entire realm of
phenomena; devas of the ocean
 who were dedicated to rescuing beings
from the ocean of existence; devas of mountains who were dedicated to
gathering the accumulation of omniscience and whose minds had ascended
to the summit
 of the roots of merit; devas of rivers who were dedicated to
adorning all beings and who were dedicated to aspiring to the
characteristics and supernatural power of all the buddhas; devas of towns
who were dedicated to caring for the towns that are the minds of all beings;

Dharma;
 yakṣa lords who were engaged in protecting all beings;
gandharva lords who were dedicated to increasing the power of joy in all

the ocean of existence; asura lords who had the aspiration to attain the body
and power of the Tathāgata, which have transcended the entire world;

down to him; deva lords who had been saddened by saṃsāra and gazed
with admiration; and lords of Brahmakāyika devas who bowed down with
great respect.
3. 2
Mañjuśrī, together with them, displaying the prowess of a bodhisattva,
respectfully made praises and offerings. Then he came out of his abode and
circumambulated the Bhagavat many hundreds of times, keeping him to his
right, and made many offerings. He then left the presence of the Bhagavat
and departed to the land of the southern region. [B27]
3. 3
Through the blessing of the Buddha, Brother Śāriputra saw Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta, who, with that display of bodhisattva miracles, departed from
Jetavana and went to the southern region. He thought, “I will go with
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta to that land.”
3. 4
Leading his following of sixty bhikṣus, he left where he was sitting,
approached the Bhagavat, bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet, and asked
for the Bhagavat’s permission. When the Bhagavat had given it, Śāriputra
circumambulated him three times, left the presence of the Bhagavat, and
went to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta had gone, together with his following
of sixty bhikṣus who had all newly and not long before entered
homelessness. They were the bhikṣus Sāgara buddhi, Mahāsudata, Puṇya-
prabha, 
Mahāvatsa, 
Vibhudatta, 
Viśuddhacārin, 
Devaśrī, 
Indramati,
Brahmottama, Praśānta mati, and others. [F.315.a]
3. 5
They had all served jinas in the past, planted
 the roots of merit, had
profound aspiration, had the purified eyes of faith, practiced with a vast
mentality, had the power to see the buddhas in the directions, had realized
the nature and character of the Dharma, had the intention to benefit others,
aspired to the qualities of the Tathāgata, and had been guided by the
Dharma teaching of Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta.
275
Leading those followers, Śāriputra went to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta
had gone.
3. 6
When Brother Śāriputra was on the way, he looked at all those bhikṣus
and said to the bhikṣu Sāgara buddhi, “Sāgara buddhi, regard the bodhisattva
Mañjuśrī upon a path that has a checkerboard pattern
 and displays of his
path as he walks along it.
276
3. 7
“His pure body is inconceivable to devas and humans. It is beautified by
the signs and features of a great being. It has a pure halo of light. It emits a
display of a network of light rays that brings joy to countless beings. It
brings to an end the sufferings of countless beings. It is accompanied by a
perfect entourage, and it is in possession of past roots of merit.
3. 8
“The displays of the prowess of his path are directed toward the domain
of every direction; the displays of his perfection of merit issue forth to the
right and left as great treasures.


---

3. 9
“These displays emerge from within all the trees as the result of his roots
of merit from serving past buddhas. All the lords of the world bow down to
him and send down a rain of clouds of offerings. All the tathāgatas in the ten
directions emanate
 multitudes of disks composed of nets of light rays that
[F.315.b] resound with all the Dharma of the buddhas and descend
 onto
the crown of his head.”
277
278
3. 10
Beginning with the above, Brother Śāriputra described, explained,
announced, narrated, related, elucidated, and brought illumination to the
bhikṣus concerning Mañjuśrī’s measureless displays of the qualities of
following the path.
3. 11
The more that Sthavira Śāriputra described Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta’s
qualities, the more the minds of the bhikṣus became purified and became
clearer, the strength of their joy increased, delight arose, the continuum of
their minds became adept, their faculties became clearer, their happiness
increased, they cast off unhappiness, they became free of the mind’s faults,
they repelled all obscurations, they became intent on seeing the Buddha,
their minds turned to the Buddha’s Dharma, their bodhisattva faculties were
purified, the power of their bodhisattva faith developed, great compassion
arose, they gained the prowess of the domain of the perfections, they fully
developed great compassion, and they perceived the ocean of buddhas in
the ten directions.
3. 12
Having attained the power of aspiration to omniscience, they spoke these
words: “Upādhyāya, we pray that we too may be able to go into the presence
of that supreme being.”
3. 13
Then Brother Śāriputra, together with the bhikṣus, went to where
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was and said these words: “Mañjuśrī, these bhikṣus
wish to see you.”
3. 14
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, [F.316.a] together with the entire circle of his
followers, turned
 and looked upon the bhikṣus with the majestic gaze of
an elephant.
279
3. 15
The bhikṣus bowed their heads to the feet of Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, and
then with their palms together in reverence they said, “Holy being, through
the roots of merit from seeing you and paying homage to you, and also our
other roots of merit that you know we have, that our upādhyāya knows we
have, and that the Bhagavat Tathāgata Śākyamuni sees we have, may we
become like you. May we obtain bodies that are the same as yours, voices the
same as yours, and features the same as yours, and may we attain
miraculous powers the same as yours.”
3. 16
When the bhikṣus had said this, Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta said to the
bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, the noble man or noble woman with the ten unflagging
motivations who enters the Mahāyāna will ascend to the level of a tathāgata,


---

and therefore, it goes without saying,
 to the level of a bodhisattva. What
are those ten? They are (1) the unflagging motivation to see, pay homage to,
offer to, and serve all the tathāgatas; (2) the unflagging motivation to never
abandon accumulating all roots of merit; (3) the unflagging motivation to
seek all Dharmas; (4) the unflagging motivation to practice all the
bodhisattva perfections; (5) the unflagging motivation to accomplish all the
bodhisattva samādhis; (6) the unflagging motivation to enter all successive
times; [F.316.b] (7) the unflagging motivation to purify the extensive oceans
of buddha realms in the ten directions; (8) the unflagging motivation to ripen
and guide all realms of beings; (9) the unflagging motivation to accomplish
the conduct of a bodhisattva in all realms and kalpas; and (10) the
unflagging motivation to accomplish one power of the tathāgatas by
ripening all beings in the way that one would ripen one being through the
practice of perfections as numerous as the atoms in all buddha realms.
280
3. 17
“Bhikṣus, the noble man or noble woman with faith who has these ten
unflagging motivations will accomplish all roots of merit, will turn away
from all existences in saṃsāra, will transcend all the worldly existences, will
transcend all the levels of śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, will become a
member of the family of all the tathāgatas, will accomplish the aspirations of
all bodhisattvas, will purify the practice of the qualities of all the tathāgatas,
will purify all bodhisattva conduct, will have the strength of all tathāgatas,
will subdue all māras and adversaries, will ascend to the level of
bodhisattvas, and will approach the level of the tathāgatas.” [F.317.a]
3. 18
When the bhikṣus heard this way of the Dharma, they attained the
samādhi the unimpeded vision that sees all the buddhas. Through its power they
saw all the tathāgatas and the circles of their assemblies that were present in
infinite, endless world realms in the ten directions. They also saw every
being that had been reborn into an existence in those world realms. They
saw every being in those world realms.
 They saw the various divisions of
those world realms. They knew the number of atoms in those worlds. They
saw the residences and adornments made of jewels
 that those beings
enjoyed. They heard the ocean of the aspects of speech of those tathāgatas.
They knew those Dharma teachings through their words, letters, definitions,
languages,
 names, and symbols.
 They viewed the minds, faculties, and
aspirations of those beings. They knew ten lifetimes back into the past and
ten lifetimes into the future. They comprehended the explanations of ten
turnings of Dharma wheels by those tathāgatas. They comprehended ten
attainments of manifestations of miraculous powers. They comprehended
the accomplishment of ten ways given in the teachings. They comprehended
ten explanations of the words of the teachings. They comprehended ten
accomplishments of the analytic knowledge of those tathāgatas.
281
282

3. 19
As soon as they attained that samādhi, [F.317.b] they perfected ten
thousand aspects of the aspiration to enlightenment, they attained ten
thousand samādhis, they purified ten thousand aspects of the perfections,
they attained a great radiance, they illuminated the domain of great wisdom,
and they attained ten bodhisattva clairvoyances.
3. 20
They who had thus attained the small young seedlings of clairvoyance
and had gained the resolute aspiration to enlightenment were then inspired
to and established in completely good bodhisattva conduct
 by Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta.
285
3. 21
They who were thus established in completely good bodhisattva conduct
entered an ocean of great aspirations and fulfilled them. Through fulfilling
an ocean of great aspirations with a pure motivation they attained purity of
the body. Through purity of the body they attained lightness of body.
Through that purity of body and lightness of body they vastly increased
their entrances to clairvoyances. They attained everlasting clairvoyances.
Through that attainment of clairvoyance, while constantly remaining at the
feet of Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta and in order to accomplish all the Dharmas of
the buddhas, they created clouds of the activities
 of the bodies of all the
tathāgatas in the ten directions.
286
3. 22
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, having established those bhikṣus in the
aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment, traveled to the southern
region and came to the great city called Dhanyākara. Having reached there,
he and his entourage went the east of Dhanyākara, [F.318.a] where there was
a great forest called Vicitra sāla dhvaja vyūha.
 It was a sacred place where
buddhas of the past had dwelled. It had been consecrated by the tathāgatas
for the ripening of beings. Its name was renowned throughout endless
realms. It was a place where the Bhagavat, when he was practicing
bodhisattva conduct in the past, performed many difficult actions of
generosity. It was a place where devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras,
garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans constantly
engaged in making offerings.
287
3. 23
There Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta taught the sūtra called The Radiance of the
Way of the Essence of Phenomena, from which arose a septillion
 sūtras. During
that teaching, many hundred thousand quintillions of nāgas came from the
great ocean. When they had heard that way of the Dharma, they became
disgusted with their existences as nāgas and aspired to have the qualities of
a tathāgata. They abandoned their nāga existences and gained rebirth as
devas or humans. Ten thousand nāgas attained irreversibility from the
highest, complete enlightenment. During the time he taught that Dharma,
endlessly numerous realms of beings were guided through the three yānas.
288

3. 24
The people in Dhanyākara heard that Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta had come to
Dhanyākara and was dwelling in the sacred Vicitra sāla dhvaja vyūha.
3. 25
The leading
 upāsaka Mahāprajña and upāsakas, upāsikās, sons, and
daughters, [F.318.b] each accompanied by an entourage that numbered five
hundred, came out from Dhanyākara city and went to where Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta was.
289
3. 26
The upāsaka Mahāprajña, with other upāsakas such as Sudatta, Vasudatta,
Puṇya prabha, 
Yaśodeva, 
Somaśriti, 
Somanandi, 
Sumati, 
Mahāmati,
Rāhulabhadra, Bhadra śrī, and so on, each with an entourage of five hundred
upāsakas, came to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was, bowed their heads to
his feet, circumambulated Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta three times, and sat to one
side.
3. 27
The upāsikā named Mahāprajñā, with other upāsikās such as Suprabhā,
Sugātrā, Subhadrā, Bhadra śrī, Candra prabhāsā, Ketuprabhā, Śrībhadrā, and
Sulocanā and so on, each with an entourage of five hundred upāsikās, came
to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was, bowed their heads to his feet,
circumambulated Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta three times, and sat to one side.
3. 28
The head merchant’s son
 Sudhana, with other sons of head merchants
such as Suvrata, Suśīla, Svācāra, Suvikrāmin, Sucinti, Sumati, Subuddhi,
Sunetra, Subāhu, Suprabha, and so on, each with an entourage of five
hundred sons of head merchants, came to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta
was, [F.319.a] bowed their heads to his feet, circumambulated Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta three times, and sat to one side.
290
3. 29
Subhadrā, the daughter of the layman Mahāprajña, with other daughters
such as Bhadrā, Abhirāmavartā, Dṛḍhamatī, Śrībhadrā, Brahmadattā,
Śrīprabhā, Suprabhā, and so on, each with an entourage of five hundred
daughters, came to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was, bowed their heads to
his feet, circumambulated Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta three times, and sat to one
side.
3. 30
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, knowing that the men, women, boys, and
girls from Dhanyākara had gathered and assembled, overwhelmed them
with the magnificence of his teaching in accordance with their wishes,
comforted them with the magnificence of his great love, accomplished the
teaching of the Dharma through the magnificence of his great compassion,
and investigated their minds and aspirations through the magnificence of
his wisdom. Delighting in teaching the Dharma with his great discernment,
he observed Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
3. 31
He said, “Why is Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, called Sudhana? The
instant that Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, entered his mother’s womb,
all around his home seven precious sprouts
 emerged. Beneath those
precious sprouts there were seven treasures of precious substances. Those
291


---

precious sprouts made of those seven precious substances rose up through
the ground from those treasures, which were gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red
pearls, emeralds, and white coral.
3. 32
“After ten months, when his limbs and body parts were completely
formed, [F.319.b] he was born. At that time, those seven great treasures
became visible, rising up above the ground to the height and breadth of
seven cubits, bright and beautiful. Inside the house appeared five hundred
pots made of various kinds of precious substances. There were pots filled
with ghee, pots filled with sesame oil, pots filled with honey, and pots filled
with butter. There were individual pots filled with whatever was necessary.
There were diamond pots filled with every kind of perfume, pots of aromatic
wood filled with various kinds of cloth, crystal pots filled with various kinds
of enjoyable food delicious with perfect flavors, jewel pots filled with various
kinds of precious substances, gold pots filled with silver powder, silver pots
filled with gold dust, pots of silver and gold filled with beryl jewels, quartz
pots filled with white coral, white-coral pots filled with quartz jewels,
emerald pots filled with red pearls, red-pearl pots filled with emeralds, cat’s-
eye-jewel pots filled with moonstone jewels, moonstone-jewel pots filled
with cat’s-eye jewels, and so on. Five hundred such precious pots appeared.
3. 33
“As soon as that Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was born, there fell a
rain of wealth, grain, money, gold, and all kinds of jewels in all the
storerooms and granaries in the house.
3. 34
“The brahmin prognosticators, his parents, and his relatives said, ‘As soon
as he was born there appeared this perfection of much wealth,’ and they
gave him the name Sudhana, meaning Excellent Wealth. [F.320.a]
3. 35
“This Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, has served past jinas, has
planted roots of merit, possesses a vast aspiration, and is motivated to follow
kalyāṇamitras. His physical, vocal, and mental actions are irreproachable. He
is dedicated to purifying the bodhisattva path. He is focused on omniscience.
He is a worthy vessel for the Dharma of the buddhas. He has a pure
manner
 of aspiration. He has perfected an unimpeded aspiration for
enlightenment.”
292
3. 36
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta looked upon Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, welcomed him, and taught him the Dharma. He taught the Dharma
through teaching on the Dharma of all the buddhas, on uniting and attaining
the Dharma of all the buddhas, on the infinity of all the buddhas,
 on the
successive appearance of all the buddhas, on the pure circles of the followers
of all the buddhas, on the display
 of the Dharma wheels and
emanations
 of all the buddhas, on the pure characteristics and features of
the bodies of all the buddhas, on the accomplishment of the Dharma body of
293
294
295


---

all the buddhas, on the display of the speech of all the buddhas, on the pure
display of the auras of all the buddhas, and on the equality of all the
buddhas.
3. 37
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, [F.320.b] through speaking about the Dharma,
taught, motivated, encouraged, and inspired Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, and that great assembly of beings, and made them develop the
aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment and remember their past
roots of merit.
3. 38
He blessed and made happy
 the beings from the city of Dhanyākara by
teaching them the Dharma according to their wishes, and he departed.
296
3. 39
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having heard from Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta the nature of the greatness and
 qualities of the buddhas,
aspired to the highest, complete enlightenment. He diligently followed
behind Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, reciting these verses of praise to him:
297
3. 40
“Oh wise one! Through your power
I am set on enlightenment for the benefit
 of beings.
298
You who have an infinite range of activity,299
Hear from the certainty that I have. {1}
3. 41
“The great city of the three realms of existence
Is encircled by a moat of the water of delight,
Has the raised walls of pride and conceit,
And has the gateways into all
 the states of beings. {2}
300
3. 42
“It is covered by the darkness
 of ignorance and unknowing;
301
It is burned by the flames of desire and anger
And is continuously ruled by the lord of māras:
That is where ignorant fools make their home. {3}
3. 43
“Confined in the fetters and chains of craving,
Rendered powerless by the defects of deception and deceit,
Their eyes blinded by doubt and uncertainty,
They are on the path that leads in the wrong direction. {4}
3. 44
“Bound tightly by the ropes of envy and greed,
They go to the unfortunate states of pretas, animals, and hells.
Tormented by aging, death, illness, and rebirth,
Bewildered they go around on the wheel of existences. {5}
3. 45
“You shine the light rays of wisdom [F.321.a]
From the disk of your pure compassion,
Which come forth
 to dry up the ocean of kleśas.
302
You who are a sun, shine upon me! {6}


---

3. 46
“The full disk of your meditation of love,
The moonlight of your merit brings happiness,
Shining on the dwellings of all beings:
You who are like a full moon, shine upon me! {7}
3. 47
“You possess the treasure of good karma’s power
And fly freely through the sky of the essence of phenomena.303
You bear the precious wheel of the Dharma.
You who are a king, give me your command! {8}
3. 48
“You have the courageous resolution
 for the path to enlightenment.
304
You have accumulated vast merit and wisdom,
And you set forth for the benefit of all beings.
Caravan leader, give me your protection! {9}
3. 49
“You wear the armor of strong, unwavering patience;
With the sword
 of wisdom and the long arm of compassion,
305
You confront the army of māras in battle.
You who are a hero, bring me to safety! {10}
3. 50
“You dwell on the summit of the Dharma Meru,
Encircled
 by the apsarases of supreme samādhi,
306
Subjugating the asura Rāhu of the kleśas.
You who are Śakra, look upon me! {11}
3. 51
“In the residence of the three realms where the foolish live,
Your knowledge clears away kleśa and karma.
In the obscurity of the wheel of existences and the level of causes
You are a lamp; reveal to me the way to proceed! {12}
3. 52
“You turn from the path that leads to the lower existences.
You make pure the path that leads to the happy existences.
You have transcended all worldly paths.
Show me the
 gateway to liberation! {13}
307
3. 53
“You close and block
 the gateway to the false beliefs
308
That have the conceptions of permanence, self, and happiness.
You possess the sharp eyes with the power
 of the wisdom of truth.
309
Quickly open for me the gateway to liberation! {14} [F.321.b]
3. 54
“You know what are the right and the wrong paths.
Skilled
 in the practices and knowledge of the paths,
310
You have mastered the ways of all paths.
Teach to me the path to enlightenment! {15}


---

3. 55
“You reside upon the plain of the level of the true view,
Bring the water of the qualities of all the buddhas,
And rain down the flowers of the Buddhadharma’s qualities.
Teach to me the path to enlightenment! {16}
3. 56
“Revealer
 of the path, show me
311
The jinas of the past and the future
And the jinas who appear in the present,
The sugatas, the principal beings in all directions. {17}
3. 57
“You who are skilled
 in employing the apparatus of karma,
312
Proficient in the apparatus of the Dharma vehicle’s chariot,
And skilled
 in employing the apparatus of wisdom,
313
Teach to me the vehicle for enlightenment! {18}
3. 58
“Bring me up onto the vehicle of enlightenment
That has the circling wheels of aspiration and resolution,
Has the stable axle of patience and vajra compassion,
And is beautified by the precious shafts of faith. {19}
3. 59
“Carry
 me in the excellent, supreme vehicle
314
That has the wheels of all mental retentions,
Is adorned by a covering roof of love,
And is beautified by the strings of bells of discernment. {20}
3. 60
“Lead me onto the royal
 vehicle
315
Adorned with a bed
 of celibacy,
316
Crowded
 with a hundred billion women of samādhi,
317
And resounding with the sound of Dharma drums. {21}
3. 61
“Reveal to me the excellent vehicle
That has the unending treasure of the four methods of gathering pupils
And is adorned by strings of qualities, the jewels of wisdom,
Tied with the supreme thongs of self-control and a sense of shame. {22}
3. 62
“Quickly place me on the supreme vehicle
That has the excellent wheels of the light rays of generosity
And is anointed with compassion and the sandalwood of good conduct,
Its parts held together by the strong nails
 of patience. {23} [F.322.a]
318
3. 63
“Bring me onto the supreme Dharma vehicle
That never turns back from guiding beings,
Has a carriage of dhyāna built high with samādhi,
And is pulled along by the union of wisdom and method. {24}

3. 64
“Bring me up onto the vehicle of the Dharma
That has the circling of the pure wheels of aspiration,
Has the great strength
 of the firm retention of the Dharma,
319
And is the perfectly well-made device of wisdom. {25}
3. 65
“Lead me onto the vehicle of completely good conduct
That has purified completely good conduct
And proceeds unhesitatingly
 to care for beings
320
With overpowering completely excellent conduct. {26}
3. 66
“Bring me up onto the excellent vehicle
That is enduring, having the nature of a diamond,
With perfectly arranged, exquisitely
 made garlands of wisdom,

And cuts through all obstructions
 and impediments. {27}

“Bring me up onto the vehicle of the Dharma,
Which is measureless and inexhaustible like pure space,
Without the defects of craving and the views of ignorance,
And remains so as to benefit all beings. {31}
3. 71
“Bring me up onto the vehicle of the Dharma,
Which is as fast as the speed of a great wind,
Seizes the world with the power of the wind

And brings it to the level of the city
 of peace. {32} [F.322.b]
328
3. 72
“Bring me up onto the supreme vehicle,
Which is as unshakable as the great surface of the earth,329
Carrying its load with the powerful speed of compassion
And nourishing beings with the harvest of wisdom. {33}

3. 73
“Reveal to me the sun of wisdom
That sustains beings like the sun,
An attracting disk with vast light rays,330
Radiant with supremely pure retention. {34}
3. 74
“You are wise in the nature of causes and all levels
Through having trained for a multitude of numerous kalpas.
Give me the sublime strong thunderbolt of knowledge
That will destroy the city of the composite. {35}
3. 75
“Within a vast ocean of wisdom
You acquired an ocean of unequaled understanding.
Ārya, describe to me the nature of that excellence —
That perfect training in all the qualities of the buddhas. {36}
3. 76
“May I see
 the city
 of the Dharma king
331
332
Where you reside possessing perfect eyes,
Adorned by the royal crown of wisdom,
Your head bound with the supreme turban of the Dharma.” {37}
3. 77
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta looked with the gaze of an elephant upon
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, and said to him, “Noble one, it is
excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, wish to follow a kalyāṇamitra and complete the
path of a bodhisattva, and wish to ask about bodhisattva conduct.
3. 78
“Noble one, it is like this: serving, following, and attending to a
kalyāṇamitra is the basis and the corresponding cause for the attainment of
omniscience.
“Therefore, noble one, you should not tire of serving and honoring a
kalyāṇamitra.” [F.323.a]
3. 79
Sudhana said, “Ārya, teach me in detail —how does a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? In what way does a bodhisattva practice it? How does
a bodhisattva commence with bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva
practice bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva perfect bodhisattva
conduct? How does a bodhisattva purify bodhisattva conduct? How does a
bodhisattva enter into bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva attain
bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva follow bodhisattva conduct?
How does a bodhisattva gain hold
 of bodhisattva conduct? How does a
bodhisattva increase bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva perfect
the domain of completely good conduct?”
333
3. 80
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta recited these verses to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son:

3. 81
“Your coming into my presence
Is like an ocean of good merit.
It is excellent that you seek supreme enlightenment
With a mind that has vast loving compassion. {38}
3. 82
“You have aspired to the unequaled conduct
In order to liberate all beings.
You will become a protector of all beings —
That is the way of bodhisattva conduct. {39}
3. 83
“Those bodhisattvas who are completely resolute,
Who have untiring minds in saṃsāra,
Attain the conduct that is completely good,
That is invincible and unimpeded. {40}
3. 84
“In order to benefit beings, you aspire
To the conduct that is completely good,
Which has the radiance
 of merit, the splendor
 of merit, [F.323.b]
334
335
An ocean of merit, and the emblems of virtue and purity.
 {41}
336
3. 85
“In the worlds in the ten directions, you will see the buddhas
Who are beyond measure, without center or end.
You will possess their clouds of Dharma
Through the power and might of your memory. {42}
3. 86
“In that way, you will see the jinas
In all the buddha realms in the ten directions.
And within
 bodhisattva conduct
337
You will fulfill
 an ocean of their aspirations. {43}
338
3. 87
“Those who enter into an ocean of this way
And are established on the level of buddhahood
Train under the lords of the world,
And thereby they all become omniscient. {44}
3. 88
“You will practice the completely good conduct
Throughout the vastness of realms
For as many kalpas as numerous as atoms
And attain the peace of enlightenment. {45}
3. 89
“You should practice for an ocean of kalpas
Throughout all the realms, which are without end,
And you should fulfill your aspiration
For the completely good conduct. {46}

3. 90
“Observe a hundred billion beings
Who are delighted on hearing your prayer:
They aspire to supreme enlightenment
Through completely good wisdom.” {47}
3. 91
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, having recited those verses, said to Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have
in that way developed the aspiration to enlightenment [F.324.a] and have the
intention to seek for bodhisattva conduct!
3. 92
“Noble one, in that way, the beings who develop the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment are very rare. Even more rare are the
beings who, having developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, then seek for bodhisattva conduct.
3. 93
“Therefore, noble one, bodhisattvas should gain certain knowledge from
true kalyāṇamitras. They should be tireless in their search for kalyāṇamitras.
They should never have enough of looking at the kalyāṇamitras. They
should successfully master the teachings of the kalyāṇamitras. They should
not become angered by the kalyāṇamitras’ conduct of skillful methods.
3. 94
“Noble one, in this southern region there is a land named Rāmāvarānta, in
which there is a mountain called Sugrīva, where there lives a bhikṣu by the
name of Meghaśrī. Go to him and ask him, ‘How do bodhisattvas train in
bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas practice it? How do bodhisattvas
commence with bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas practice
bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas perfect bodhisattva conduct?
How do they purify it? How do they enter it? How do they attain it? How do
they follow it? How do they maintain
 it? How do they increase it? How do
bodhisattvas perfect the domain of completely good conduct?’
339
“Then that kalyāṇamitra will teach you the domain of completely good
conduct.”
3. 95
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, filled with joy, delighted, elated,
pleased, and happy, [F.324.b] bowed his head to the feet of Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta. He circumambulated Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta many hundreds
of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back at him
many hundreds of thousands of times, with his mind enraptured by that
kalyāṇamitra, unable to endure not seeing that kalyāṇamitra, with his face
covered in tears and weeping, he departed from Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta.
