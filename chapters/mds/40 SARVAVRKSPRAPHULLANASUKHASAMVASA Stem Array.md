Chapter 40
SARVA VṚKṢPRAPHULLANA SUKHA- 
SAṂVĀSĀ
40. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, further meditating on, believing in,
and increasing the bodhisattva liberation called the entry into beautiful sounds
and profound manifestations, went to where the night goddess Sarva-
vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā was. He saw the night goddess Sarva-
vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā seated upon a lion throne consisting of the
saplings of precious trees, inside a kūṭāgāra made from the branches of all
perfumed precious trees and encircled by an entourage of ten thousand
night goddesses. [F.159.b]
1554
40. 2
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the night
goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā and then stood before her.
With his hands placed together in homage, he said, “Goddess, I have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, and so I
pray that you explain how bodhisattvas should practice bodhisattva
conduct, how they should train in it, and how, having practiced and trained
in it, they proceed toward omniscience!”
40. 3
The night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā said to Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, through my power, when the sun sets
in the Sahā world realm, the lotus blossoms close,
 the men and women
who are dedicated to delighting in pleasures in parks have the wish to
return to their homes, the beings who travel along roads and narrow paths
think of finding somewhere to stay for the night, and they turn their
attention to all the safe dwellings for beings. Those who dwell in forests, in
mountain clefts, and in caves enter their forests, clefts, and caves. Those
beings who dwell in trees think of returning to their homes in the trees.
Those beings who dwell in holes return to their holes. Those beings who
dwell in villages, towns, districts, and lands return to their villages, towns,
districts, and lands. Those beings who dwell in water enter the water. Those
1555


---

beings who have gone to lands in other directions begin to think of the
directions of their own lands in order to remain in a feeling of happiness
during the night.
40. 4
“Moreover, noble one, to the young men and women in the prime of life
who are intoxicated by youthfulness, intoxicated by the delights of singing,
dancing, and music, [F.160.a] who are dedicated to delighting in sensory
pleasures, to them I praise dedication to creating roots of merit as a remedy
for the fear of birth, old age, death, and the great darkness of ignorance. I
bring beings who are miserly to the practice of generosity. I bring beings
who have bad conduct to the practice of correct conduct. I praise love to
beings who have malicious minds. I establish beings with disturbed minds
in the practice of patience. I establish beings who are lazy in the practice of
undertaking bodhisattva diligence. I establish beings who have intoxicated
minds in the practice of dhyāna. I bring beings with poor wisdom to the
practice of the perfection of wisdom. I establish beings who aspire to the
lower yānas in the practice of the Mahāyāna. I establish beings who have
attachment to the three realms in the bodhisattva perfection of prayer, the
field of the ultimate conclusion of the paths of existence. I establish in the
perfection of bodhisattva strength those beings who are overpowered by
their objects of perception,
 are tormented by karma and kleśas, and have
weak merit and wisdom. I establish in the perfection of bodhisattva
knowledge those beings who are overwhelmed by the darkness of
ignorance and enveloped in the darkness of believing in a self and
possessions.
1556
40. 5
“Moreover, noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
arising of the vast radiating light of joy.”
40. 6
Sudhana asked, “Goddess, what is this bodhisattva liberation called the
arising of the vast radiating light of joy like?” [F.160.b]
40. 7
She answered, “Noble one, this bodhisattva liberation has the radiance of
the knowledge and methods of gathering beings through the merit of the
tathāgatas. Why is that?
40. 8
“Noble one, it is because all happiness that beings experience occurs
through the power of the merit of the tathāgatas, through the path of
instruction of the tathāgatas, through practicing the words of the tathāgatas,
through following the example of the tathāgatas, through the blessing of the
tathāgatas, through practicing the path taught by the tathāgatas,
 through
creating roots of merit in the same way the tathāgatas have, through the
power of the natural result of the Dharma that is taught by the tathāgatas,
and through illumination from the sun of the wisdom of the tathāgatas.
1557
40. 9
“Noble one, the happiness of beings arises from the light of the disk of
good qualities
 of the family of the tathāgatas. Why is that?
1558


---

40. 10
“Noble one, it is like this: I realized this bodhisattva liberation called the
arising of the vast radiating light of joy when I remembered, comprehended, and
understood the ocean of the past bodhisattva conduct of the Bhagavat
Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Vairocana.
40. 11
“When, in the past, the Bhagavat was on the bodhisattva bhūmis, he
developed a motivation of great compassion on seeing beings with the belief
in a self, with the belief in possessions, enveloped in the darkness of
ignorance, wandering in the wilderness of thickets of wrong views, under
the power of craving,
 [F.161.a] imprisoned within the bondage of desire,
having thoughts of hatred caused by anger, with their minds disturbed by
ignorance, ensnared by jealousy and greed, with their minds disturbed by
kleśas, experiencing great suffering in saṃsāra, afflicted by the suffering of
poverty in saṃsāra, and having turned away from the sight of a buddha.
1559
40. 12
“He developed a motivation to benefit all beings through the
accumulation and possession of precious requisites in the world, a
motivation to produce necessary requisites for all beings, a motivation that
was without attachment to anything, a motivation that had no yearning for
anything in the entire field of perceptions, a motivation that had no clinging
to any pleasure, a motivation that had no longing for any enjoyment, a
motivation that had no wish for results ripening from generosity, a
motivation that had no longing for any worldly prosperity, a motivation that
was not
 oblivious of causes and conditions, a motivation that had the
understanding of the Dharma that was being sought, and a motivation that
had attained dedication to the benefit of all beings.
1560
40. 13
“In that way, he had a mind that understood the nature of all phenomena,
the realization of the impartiality of great love toward all realms of beings.
He had the activity of spreading clouds of great compassion over all worlds
of beings. He possessed a great round parasol of the Dharma that sheltered
all worlds of beings. [F.161.b] He possessed the thunderbolt weapon of great
wisdom that destroys the mountains of obscurations of all beings. His mind
had the increasing power of contentment through bringing happiness to all
beings. His mind prayed that all beings would attain the ultimate happiness;
he intended to send down a rain of wealth on all beings in accordance with
their wishes and aspirations. His mind never abandoned beings but was
focused on them all equally. He intended to satisfy all beings with the
wealth of the āryas. He intended that they attain the supreme, stainless,
precious knowledge of the ten strengths. He had attained the strength of the
higher cognitions of a bodhisattva. He filled the entirety of the realms of
beings and the vast realm of phenomena, as far as space extends, with great
clouds of various miraculous bodhisattva manifestations. He manifested his


---

presence before all beings and sent down a gift of great rain from a cloud of
every form and every kind of object of perception. He sent down rain from a
great cloud of every kind of precious jewelry.
40. 14
“In that way, so that all beings could have enjoyment according to their
own kind, he accomplished giving infinite, different kinds of things,
practiced countless different kinds of assistance, engaged in accumulating
all the many various kinds of gifts, practiced the conduct of giving away a
numerous variety of things, produced an indescribable array of different
kinds of requisites, and realized the way of infinite generosity that satisfies
beings according to their aspirations with an accumulation of various gifts
with various characteristics. [F.162.a]
40. 15
“Thus he gave, conferred, and bestowed all the things that would bring
contentment to beings according to their aspirations. He engaged in saving
all beings from continuous composite suffering. He had no wish for any
being to repay his kindness. He possessed the realization of the equality of
all beings, so that he purified the precious minds of all beings, and through
the methods of gathering beings that have arisen from the roots of merit of
all buddhas as a single ocean, he sent down a rain of requisites in
accordance with the wishes of all beings, and he increased the power of the
ocean of the merit of omniscience for all beings.
40. 16
“He accomplished this in order to purify the successive ripening and
guiding of all beings without exception in each instant of mind; in order in
each instant of mind to cover and adorn the succession of all realms without
exception with the pure adornments of the highest, undefiled buddha
realms; in order in each instant of mind to pervade and purify the ocean of
the ways of all phenomena without exception; in order in each instant of
mind to complete the way of wisdom that pervades the entire extent of space
without exception; in order in each instant of mind to purify the way of the
wisdom that comprehends all beings and times without exception; in order
in each instant of mind to attain the illumination of the way of the wisdom
that guides all beings without exception; [F.162.b] in order in each instant of
mind to irreversibly
 turn the wheel of the Dharma in all times without
exception; and in order in each instant of mind to benefit all beings through
revealing all skills, without exception, that are the blessing of omniscient
wisdom.
1561
40. 17
“He performed bodhisattva conduct in each instant of mind in all the
numbers of world realms without exception; in the arisen
 ocean of all
world realms; in the congregation of the ocean of all world realms; in the vast
extent of world realms of various descriptions; within the array of the
boundaries of various differentiated families
 of world realms with
boundaries; with descriptions of various bases and masses; in world realms
1562
1563


---

with descriptions of various divisions into kalpas; in world realms that were
defiled but also pure, pure but also defiled, entirely pure, and entirely
defiled, that were immense, vast, measureless, narrow, minute, and huge,
high, level, sideways, upside-down, facing the principal directions and the
intermediate directions, and located in the ocean of various directions; and in
an array of various shapes and entrances described in various ways.
40. 18
“He entered a bodhisattva’s faultlessness in order to spread widely his
bodhisattva conduct and miraculous manifestations, in order that in each
instant of mind other beings would perceive in their minds and thoughts all
the activity
 of the buddhas of the three times without exception, so that
all beings would accomplish increasing the ocean of merit of omniscience. I
know and I remember his accomplishment.
 [F.163.a]
1564
1565
40. 19
“Noble one, in that way, when the Bhagavat Vairocana was previously
practicing bodhisattva conduct, he had compassion for those dwelling in the
world, who were devoid of the accumulations of merit and wisdom, who
were filled with ingratitude toward other beings, who were enveloped by
the darkness of ignorance, who were attached to belief in a self and belief in
possessions, who were obscured by the darkness and blindness of
ignorance, who had inappropriate thoughts, who were deep
 in the
wilderness of thickets of wrong views, who were ignorant of cause and
results, who were under the power of kleśas and karma, who had fallen into
the underground world of the great suffering of saṃsāra’s wilderness and
were experiencing the various
 sufferings of poverty.
1566
1567
40. 20
“Having compassion for them, he praised establishing strong roots of
merit through a vast cloud of the practice of the perfections, dispelled
saṃsāra’s suffering of poverty in all beings, inspired them toward a great
accumulation of merit and wisdom, elucidated the aspect of the field of
causes, explained the aspect of actions that are in accord with the Dharma,
illuminated 
the 
aspect 
of 
understanding
 
the 
domain 
of 
the
Buddhadharma, elucidated the aspect of the aspirations of beings, taught the
aspect of the creation of the realms of beings, followed the aspect of the
uninterrupted family of all the buddhas, held the aspect of the teaching of all
the buddhas, dispelled the aspect of all bad qualities, described the aspect of
the accumulation of omniscience, [F.163.b] and filled all the realms of beings
with the great cloud of the perfections. Having accomplished that, he
satisfied beings in accordance with their aspirations, establishing beings in
the compilation of the Dharma; he inspired them toward the accumulation of
omniscience; he brought them to the great perfections of a bodhisattva; he
increased the ocean of the roots of merit of beings; he strengthened them
1568


---

through the attainment of the wealth of the āryas; and he increased the
ocean of the roots of merit of beings through the power of their aspiration for
omniscience.
40. 21
“He brought them to enter the gateways to the miraculous manifestations
of the tathāgatas, gathered them through possessing the bliss of the
pacification of the skandhas, made them aspire to the greatness that is the
nature of the tathāgatas, and established them in the wisdom possessed by
the bodhisattvas.”
40. 22
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, how long has it been since you entered upon the
highest, complete enlightenment?”
40. 23
She answered, “Noble one, this is a subject that is difficult to believe in,
difficult to know, difficult to aspire to, difficult to comprehend, difficult to
describe, and difficult to understand; the world and its devas and the
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas are unable to comprehend it. However,
through the blessing of the tathāgatas, through being in the care of a
kalyāṇamitra,
 those beings who have no yearning for any bliss in
saṃsāra, who are focused on the bliss of the tathāgatas, who are engaged in
ending the suffering and unhappiness of all beings, who aspire to the
knowledge
 that comprehends the ocean of the qualities of the tathāgatas,
[F.164.a] who have realized the nature of all phenomena and have space as
their field of activity, who are purified by the path of a vast aspiration, who
have turned away from the course of saṃsāra, who aspire to the ocean of
wisdom of all the tathāgatas, who are determined to go to the city of the
Dharma,
 who have the diligence to attain the field of activity of the
tathāgatas, who have the prowess to reach the level of the buddhas, who
aspire to the perfection of the power of omniscience, and who have fully
attained the ten strengths, with a mind supported by a vast accumulation of
merit and wisdom, with a pure motivation, with a mind that is not
disheartened, is not defiled, is not insincere, is unimpaired, has not
narrowed, and is not in darkness, with a mind that is illuminated by the light
of completely illuminating wisdom, with a mind intent on bringing
happiness and benefit to all beings, with a mind that cannot be defeated by
the kleśas and all Māra’s entourage, and with a mind that has the
opportunity to attain omniscient wisdom, are able to understand,
comprehend, believe in, grasp, follow, and know this subject.
1569
1570
1571
1572
40. 24
“Why is that? Noble one, this subject is the field of the knowledge of the
tathāgatas. All bodhisattvas, let alone all other beings, cannot reach it.
Nevertheless, through the blessing of the tathāgatas, I teach it so that noble
beings will have a perfectly pure motivation, so that beings with a conduct of
roots of virtue will have a superior motivation, and so that you will obtain
the arising of the true answer to your sincere
 question.” [F.164.b]
1573

40. 25
Then, at that time, the night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha-
saṃvāsā, in order to teach this meaning further, looking into the field of
knowledge of the tathāgatas of the three times, recited these verses:
40. 26
“The profound, inconceivable field of knowledge of the buddhas
About which you, son of the buddhas, have asked a question
Cannot be entirely explained, even in as many kalpas
As there are atoms in countless realms. {1}
40. 27
“Beings who have desiring minds and those with angry minds,
And similarly those obscured by the darkness of ignorance
And those who are afflicted by hypocrisy and arrogance,
Are unable to know the peace of the true nature of the jinas. {2}
40. 28
“Those who are overpowered by and follow envy and jealousy,
Those who are polluted by thoughts of deception and deceit,
And those who are obscured by the obscuration of kleśas and karma
Are unable to know this field of the buddhas. {3}
40. 29
“Those who are established in the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas,
Those who are dependent on the destructible accumulation,
And those whose minds and views are aberrant
Are unable to know this level of the buddhas. {4}
40. 30
“The field of the jinas is a peace that is difficult to comprehend.
Its nature is stainless, and it is without conceptualization.
Those who are dependent on existence and cling to saṃsāra
Are not able to know this Dharma. {5}
40. 31
“This is the field for those ṛṣis
Of the family and born in the family
 of the buddhas,
1574
Who have been consecrated by all the tathāgatas
And are holders of the lineage of the Dharma king. {6}
40. 32
“Those who are never satisfied by an ocean of good qualities,
Who have been taken into the care of kalyāṇamitras,
And who have a cloud of aspiration focused on the strengths of the munis
Attain peace when they hear this. {7}
40. 33
“Those who have stainless, nonconceptual motivation,
Whose understanding is like a cloud of lamps ending darkness —
Those stainless ones have this field of activity
Throughout the main and intermediate directions, to the extent of space. {8}
[F.165.a]


---

40. 34
“They who have a motivation of compassion for the ocean of beings —
Their presence pervades the entire three times.
They follow every single being with love,
Entering this way of the jinas. {9}
40. 35
“Those who have a rapturous mind that is free of grasping
Are constantly dedicated to giving away everything.
They engage in activity with all beings equally
And have no attachment to this level of conduct. {10}
40. 36
“Those who are without defilements, with conduct free of transgressions,
Who are dedicated to practicing the teaching of the buddhas
And whose minds have repentance of wrongdoing
 —
1575
Those stainless ones have this field of activity. {11}
40. 37
“Those who have unshakable, steadfast minds,
Whose minds have realized the nature of phenomena,
Who have minds unhindered by an ocean of karma —
For them this liberation is inexhaustible. {12}
40. 38
“For those with minds that are never disheartened,
 never turn back,
1576
Those who have strong and powerful diligence,
With endless diligence for the accumulation of omniscience —
For those with excellent discipline, there is this field of activity. {13}
40. 39
“Those with minds of peace, minds at rest,
Who are in complete peace, unfevered,
Practicing an ocean of omniscient dhyāna —
For those who have become peaceful, there is this way. {14}
40. 40
“Those whose minds are freed from all attachment,
Whose minds have understood the nature of phenomena,
Who have realized the Dharma realm of the jinas —
For those who are lamps of wisdom, there is this way. {15}
40. 41
“Those whose minds have realized the nature of beings,
Whose minds have no attachment to the ocean of existence,
Who appear to the minds of beings like the reflections of the moon —
For those who are wise in the path, there is this liberation. {16}
40. 42
“Those who practice in all future realms
That arise from the ocean of the family of prayers [F.165.b]
Of the ocean of jinas who are in the three times —
For those who are completely good, there is this way. {17}


---

40. 43
“Those who through an ocean of the ways of the realm of Dharma
Enter into the entire ocean of worlds
In all the kalpas of creation and destruction —
For those who are free of conceptualization, there is this liberation. {18}
40. 44
“Those who see, in the atoms of the realms in all directions,
Countless buddhas at the foot of the kings of trees
Attaining enlightenment and guiding beings —
For those with vision free of attachment, there is this way. {19}
40. 45
“You have served kalyāṇamitras
Through a great ocean of kalpas
And so have come here, unwearyingly seeking the Dharma.
You are able to hold this when you have heard it. {20}
40. 46
“In order to purify your motivation,
Through the inconceivable blessing of the sugatas1577
This immeasurable field of Vairocana
Will arise without impediment from my words. {21}
40. 47
“Noble one, in a time in the past even beyond as many kalpas as there are
atoms in a world realm, there was an ocean of world realms called Maṇi-
kanaka parvata śikhara vairocana.
40. 48
“Noble one, in that ocean of world realms called Maṇi kanaka parvata-
śikhara vairocana there was a tathāgata by the name of Jñāna parvata dharma-
dhātu dikpratapana tejorāja. 
The 
Tathāgata 
Jñāna parvata dharma dhātu-
dikpratapana tejorāja, through his previous bodhisattva conduct, had
purified the ocean of world realms called Maṇi kanaka parvata śikhara-
vairocana.1578
40. 49
“In that ocean of world realms called Maṇi kanaka parvata śikhara vairocana
appeared as many ranges of world realms as there are atoms in the earth and
the mountains. In each range of world realms appeared as many groups of
world realms as there are atoms in a multitude of world realms. In each
world realm
 appeared as many kalpas as there are atoms in a world
realm. In each kalpa appeared numerous intermediate kalpas. [F.166.a] In
each intermediate kalpa appeared numerous world realms with different
appearances. In those appeared various occurrences of tathāgatas and their
miraculous manifestations. During each appearance of a buddha appeared as
many sūtras as there are atoms in a world realm. Within each sūtra appeared
as many prophecies to bodhisattvas as there are atoms in a world realm.
There appeared a vast extent of guided beings, without edge or center,
accomplishment through the ways of various yānas, and guidance through
various miraculous manifestations.
1579


---

40. 50
“Noble one, in that ocean of world realms called Maṇi kanaka parvata-
śikhara vairocana there was a central group of world realms called Samanta-
digabhimukha dvāra dhvaja vyūha.
40. 51
“Noble one, in that central group of world realms called Samanta-
digabhimukha dvāra dhvaja vyūha there was the world realm called Sarva-
ratna varṇa samanta prabhāsa śrī.
40. 52
“It had a display of basis and borders of world realms. It had the shining
bodhimaṇḍas of all the tathāgatas that were made of kings of jewels.
 It
resided upon an ocean of flowers of various jewels. Its main mass was made
of kings of precious jewels in which appeared the images of the emanations
of all the tathāgatas. It had the form of a city of devas. It was both pure and
defiled.
1580
40. 53
“In that world realm there were as many four-continent world realms as
there are atoms in Sumeru. The central four continents among those four
continents that were as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru was called Sarva-
ratna śikhara dhvaja. In that four-continent world called Sarva ratna śikhara-
dhvaja, each of the four continents was a hundred thousand yojanas wide.
[F.166.b] In each of those continents there were a thousand great cities. In
the center of the Jambudvīpa of that four-continent world there was a royal
capital called Ratna sāla vyūha megha pradīpā, which was encircled by ten
thousand cities.
40. 54
“At that time, the people of that Jambudvīpa had a lifespan of ten
thousand years. In the royal capital called Ratna sāla vyūha megha pradīpā
there was a cakravartin king by the name of Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra-
maṇḍala nirghoṣa. 
The 
cakravartin 
king 
Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra-
maṇḍala nirghoṣa had five hundred ministers. He had sixty thousand
queens. He had seven hundred sons who were all courageous and heroic,
with perfectly formed bodies, handsome and magnificent, and very strong.
40. 55
“During the time of King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa,
he protected all of Jambudvīpa under one parasol and vanquished all
enemies and opponents. During that time, in that world realm, as the
intermediate kalpa was ending, the five degenerations appeared, the path of
the ten good actions vanished, beings practiced the path of the ten bad
actions, and most went to the lower realms. Their following the path of bad
actions became the cause for lifespans to become short, pleasures to be few,
and bodies to be ugly, have a bad color, and be misshapen. There was little
happiness and the experience of many kinds of suffering. They deceived and
betrayed one another. They caused divisions between one another. They
engaged in harsh speech. They spoke incoherently. They were overcome by
overpowering desires. [F.167.a] They had the thoughts of angry minds. They
wandered in a wilderness of various thickets of wrong views. They clung to


---

desires that were contrary to the Dharma, and they were overcome by those
overpowering desires. They were encompassed by false Dharma. Therefore,
trees, plants, and harvests of food did not grow from the ground. The rain
did not come on time. For those beings, the grass, herbs, shrubs, forests,
orchards, and trees withered. They were afflicted by various illnesses.
Throughout the main and intermediate directions they had no protector, and
so they disrespected and were in contention with one another.
40. 56
“They all gathered together and went to the royal capital Ratna sāla vyūha-
megha pradīpā. They surrounded it, some with their arms upraised, some
with hands clasped together, some with their bodies trembling, some
collapsing,
 some falling with their heads on the ground, some with their
bodies stretched out on the ground prostrate, some kneeling, some waving
their arms in the air, some naked without clothes, some with an ugly
expression of the face and eyes. They stared at King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa and cried out in a great piteous clamor,
‘Your Majesty! We are in distress! The suffering of hunger and thirst pains
us! We are afflicted by various fears! We have no refuge! We have no
protector or last resort! We are walled around by suffering! We are losing our
lives! We are facing death!’
1581
40. 57
“In that way they wailed in various ways, crying out with various kinds of
voices, with various words, various unpleasant facial expressions, various
verbal expressions,
 terms of speech, and words from various dialects and
in various accents. [F.167.b].
1582
40. 58
“All the men and women, boys and girls of that royal capital, who were
tormented by hunger and thirst, whose bodies were devoid of jewelry, who
had no clothes and were naked, who were unsightly and discolored, whose
skin was cracked and rough, and who were suffering and unhappy, were in
distress, yearning for happiness, and afraid of suffering. Therefore, they
sought protection from the great wise being King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa as a refuge, perceiving him to be someone
through whom they could obtain happiness, perceiving him to be someone
through whom they could become free of suffering,
 perceiving him to be
someone through whom they could gain sustenance and obtain treasure,
perceiving him to be like the sight of a ford, perceiving him to be a ship,
perceiving him to be a great island of wisdom,
 perceiving him to be
someone through whom they could attain a great benefit, and perceiving
him to be someone through whom they could obtain all the joys and
happiness of higher existences.
1583
1584
40. 59
“When King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa heard the
great clamor of the wailing of numerous piteous cries from all around him,
he entered countless millions of gateways into great compassion. His mind


---

resting in the mental state that is the way of great compassion, he
contemplated one-pointedly for a moment and then spoke ten sentences of
great compassion. What were those ten? They were:
40. 60
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings have fallen into the abyss of saṃsāra and
are without a support. When can I become a refuge for these beings, who
have fallen into the great abyss of saṃsāra, and bring them to the level of the
tathāgatas?
40. 61
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings are oppressed by the torment of the kleśas
and have no refuge. When can I become a refuge for these beings, who are
frightened by various kleśas, without a refuge, and oppressed by the
torment of the kleśas, and establish them in irreproachable actions? [F.168.a]
40. 62
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings are overcome by the fear of old age and
death in this world and have no refuge. When can I become a refuge for

by a mind with the aspiration of a bodhisattva, who had been manifested by
a mind with the aspiration of a bodhisattva, he felt in his mind affection,
delight, and benevolence

kalyāṇamitras. [F.171.b] There arose in him a vast and powerful great
compassion. He also developed the powerful diligence that would never
turn back from satisfying all supplicants throughout future kalpas. There
also arose all-pervading clouds of the aspiration to be equally engaged in
generosity toward all beings.

arose in him. His mind was overpowered
 by bliss and happiness. He
experienced an intensely powerful delight. The power of a great joy arose in
him. The great strength of the power of faith in and aspiration for the
enlightenment of buddhahood increased. The heartfelt faith in omniscience
increased. The strength of his pure, superior aspiration for the Dharma of all
the buddhas increased. He became capable of attaining the powers of a

accumulating completely and totally an ocean of the roots of merit; the
continuum of his mind had transcended all attachment; he had no
attachment to any sensory object in the world; his field of activity was space,
which is the nature of phenomena; he perceived them to be worthy of
offerings; he perceived them to be kalyāṇamitras; he perceived them to be
rare; he perceived them to be those who do what is difficult; he perceived
them to be those who do much; he perceived them to be of the highest
benefit; he perceived them to be teachers of the path to enlightenment; he
perceived them to be ācāryas; and he perceived them to be teachers.

whatever the things they sought, he satisfied those supplicants through the
gateway of generosity that was without any disapproval, that had a great
range of love, that was not dependent on what the supplicants would do
with what they received, that had the light rays of great generosity, and that
was united with the equality of all beings.

“He gave food to those who wanted food. He gave drink to those who
wanted drink. He gave clothes to those who wanted clothes. He gave
flowers to those who wanted flowers. In the same way, he gave perfumes,
garlands, ointments, powders, robes,
 parasols, banners, flags, precious
materials, jewelry, seats, beds, houses, divine palaces, temples, orchards,
parks, forests for ascetics, cavalry, elephants, [F.173.a] chariots, infantry,

harem, court, and royal treasures. He said, ‘Take whatever you want!’ If they
wanted a land, he gave them a land; if they wanted a city, he gave them a
city; if they wanted a town, he gave them a town. Treating all beings equally,
he gave away everything he owned to those supplicants, and in giving away
everything presented
 it to them. [B11]

“At that time, there was a head merchant’s daughter by the name of
Ratnaprabhā, who had an entourage of sixty girls and had arrived at the site
of the great offering. She was beautiful, attractive, and pretty; she had the
most perfectly formed, magnificent color; she was the color of gold; her hair
was deep black; her eyes were a contrasting deep black and white; she had a
pleasant, beautiful aroma; she had the voice of Brahmā; she wore excellent
clothing; she was perfectly adorned in jewelry; she had mindfulness and
intelligence; she had joy and a sense of shame; she had perfect conduct and
costume; she had respect for the gurus; she acted with perfect mindfulness;
she had profound activities; she had received, retained, and comprehended
the Dharma; she was honest; she had created excellent roots of merit in the
past; the continuum of her mind was clear, as it had been moistened by the
Dharma; she had pure, virtuous thoughts; she had a vast aspiration; she had
space as her field of activity; she had a mind that rejoiced in benefiting
others; [F.173.b] she was turned toward the direction of seeing the buddhas;
and she aspired to omniscience.
40. 97
“Ratnaprabhā, the head merchant’s daughter, was standing with palms
together in homage, not far away, on the right-hand side of the lion throne of
King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa. She bowed down to the
king but did not take anything from him. Then she went to one side and
thought, ‘That I have been able to see and to be with this kind of
kalyāṇamitra is an excellent attainment.’

40. 98
“She perceived King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa to be a
kalyāṇamitra, perceived him to be a teacher, perceived him to be
compassionate, perceived him to be someone who benefits others, and
perceived him to be a buddha.

“She attained the power of joy, aspiration, and enthusiasm, and with a
mind that was free of dissimulation, she removed her jewelry and, gazing at
King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa, threw it toward him,
scattering it on the platform at the foot of the lion throne. When she had in
that way scattered her jewelry, she made this prayer: ‘May I in the future
become the same as King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa,
who is a refuge for beings who have no protector and are enveloped in
darkness. May I know whatever Dharma he knows. May I set forth through
whatever yāna he has set forth. May I follow whatever path he has followed;
may I become just like him whose body gives unending pleasure when
gazed upon, who has a limitless entourage [F.174.a] and is undefeatable,
invincible, and unconquerable. Wherever he is born, may I also be reborn
there.’
40. 100
“King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa knew what her mind
was focused on and engaged with, and he said to her, ‘Girl, take whatever
you need! Girl, I am giving away all my possessions. I am engaged in
satisfying all beings.’
40. 101
“She thought, ‘King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa has
understood me,’ and gained an even greater faith in him. With that faith in
him, giving rise to the power of immense vast roots of merit, she recited
these verses to King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa:
40. 102
“ ‘In the past, in Sāla vyūha megha,

And a net of clouds of the light of a thousand suns
Spreading upward as far as Sumeru’s summit. {59}
40. 140
“ ‘It had a diamond stem and an aromatic center.
Its multitude of pure petals were lords of jewels.
Its pericarp was splendid Jambu River gold.
It had a perfection of bright stamens with an excellent aroma. {60}
40. 141
“ ‘You, lord, were born upon that pericarp.
You appeared
 sitting cross-legged,

Your beautiful body adorned by the signs of a great being,
With hundreds of devas making offerings to you. {61}
40. 142
“ ‘The king descended from the terrace’s platform.1618
He reached out with his arms and lifted you up,
Gave you to the supreme
 queen, and said these words:
1619
“This is your son! Be of happy mind!” {62}
40. 143
“ ‘When you, protector of the world, were thus born,
Ten million treasures appeared,
The buds of all trees opened,
And the sound of music came from the sky. {63} [F.176.b]
40. 144
“ ‘All the beings in Jambudhvaja
Gazed upon you, bowed, and paid homage.
With palms together they said with joy,
“Oh! You have come as a protector for the helpless!” {64}
40. 145
“ ‘From your body you radiated light rays
That illuminated the entire world,
Eliminating all the darkness in beings
And bringing to an end every kind of illness. {65}
40. 146
“ ‘Those gatherings of yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and piśācas
Who were causing harm were dispelled.
All poisonous snakes, who with malicious intent
Killed beings, were rendered immobile. {66}
40. 147
“ ‘The suffering of misfortune and disgrace,
Being afflicted by illness, harmed by many illnesses
All these were, in brief, brought to an end, ceased to exist,
And there was great happiness throughout the entire world. {67}
40. 148
“ ‘At that time, all beings had loving minds,
Perceiving one another as being like their mother.
Without aggression and without violence,
They practiced the path to omniscience. {68}
40. 149
“ ‘They were turned away from the lower existences,
Turned toward the great path to higher existences,
And shown the path toward omniscience.
In that way you created a vast benefit for beings. {69}

“ ‘Your generosity has been as vast as an ocean.
I
 have attained the excellent attainment of seeing you.

You have come to be a marvelous guide
For those who have been helplessly lost for a long time.’ {70}
40. 151
“The head merchant’s daughter, Ratnaprabhā, praised King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa with those verses. Having honored and
praised him, she circumambulated him, keeping him to her right, a hundred
thousand times. Having paid homage, she reverently went to sit to one side.
40. 152
“King 
Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa 
looked 
at 
the
merchant’s daughter Ratnaprabhā and said these words: ‘Girl, it is excellent,
excellent, that you have thus set out for the higher knowledge that knows
the special qualities of other beings. [F.177.a]
40. 153
“ ‘Girl, beings who aspire for the good qualities in other beings are rare in
all worlds.
“ ‘Girl, beings who are obscured by darkness, who are ungrateful, who
have wrong judgment, who have disturbed minds, whose trains of thought
are in disorder, whose minds are in darkness, whose thoughts are naturally
ruinous, who do not practice, and who do not know the special qualities of
other beings are unable to comprehend the qualities of bodhisattvas, to
conceive the qualities of the tathāgatas, or to attain the higher cognition that
is the unique knowledge of all qualities.
40. 154
“ ‘Therefore, girl, as you comprehend the qualities of the bodhisattvas
through a higher cognition of great beings, you are, without doubt,
established in the way to enlightenment.
40. 155
“ ‘My prowess in gathering together the beings of Jambudvīpa has proved
meaningful because someone like you, with your kind of knowledge, has
been born in my realm.’
40. 156
“Then King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa picked up with
his own hands a great, priceless, precious jewel, a multicolored precious
jewel that contained the lights of the stars, and priceless, precious clothing,
and gave them to the head merchant’s daughter Ratnaprabhā. He gave
various precious clothing to each of the girls in Ratnaprabhā’s entourage.
[F.177.b] He said, ‘Girl, take this precious clothing, keep it, and wear it
yourself!’
40. 157
“Then the head merchant’s daughter, Ratnaprabhā, accompanied by her
entourage, knelt with both knees on the ground, took up the precious
clothing with both hands, placed it on her head, withdrew, and put on that
precious clothing. All the girls in the entourage also each put on their own
precious clothing. When she had put on that precious clothing, accompanied
by her entourage of girls, she circumambulated King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa, keeping him to her right. The images of all
constellations and stars appeared on those precious clothes. When the

gathering of people saw her, they said, ‘Girl, your entourage of girls is as
beautiful as a night goddess adorned by the stars. You, encircled by them,
are even more beautiful.’ ”
40. 158
Then the night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā said to
Sudhana, “Noble one, what do you think? At that time, in that time, who was
King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa? Do not think that it was
anyone else, for at that time, in that time, it was this bhagavat tathāgata arhat
samyak saṃbuddha Vairocana who was King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra-
maṇḍala nirghoṣa.
40. 159
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Padmaprabhā, the queen of King Jyotiṣprabha and the mother of King Sarva-
dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa? Do not think that it was anyone
else, for at that time, in that time, Māyādevī was Padmaprabhā, the king’s
queen who took the miraculously born prince onto her lap.1621
40. 160
“Also, what do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Jyotiṣprabha, the father of King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala-
nirghoṣa? Do not think that it was anyone else, for at that time, in that time,
Śuddhodana was the king named Jyotiṣprabha. [F.178.a]
40. 161
“Also, what do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Ratnaprabhā, the head merchant’s daughter? Do not think that it was
anyone else, for at that time, in that time, I was Ratnaprabhā, the head
merchant’s daughter.
40. 162
“Also, what do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who were
the beings who had been born in Jambudvīpa and whom King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa had gathered together through the four
methods of gathering pupils? Do not think that it was anyone else, for they
are those who are gathered in this assembly of the followers of the Bhagavat,
have been established on the bodhisattva path, and are progressing
irreversibly toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Some are
established on the first bhūmi, some on the second bhūmi, some on the third
bhūmi, some on the fourth bhūmi, some on the fifth bhūmi, some on the sixth
bhūmi, some on the seventh bhūmi, some on the eighth bhūmi, some on the
ninth bhūmi, and some are established on the tenth bodhisattva bhūmi.
40. 163
“They are bodhisattvas who have their attainments through various kinds
of prayers, various ways of setting out toward omniscience, various
accumulations, various accomplishments,
 various conducts,
 various
setting forths, various pure displays of the path, various supremacies in
miraculous manifestations, and different kinds of displays of the path.
1622
1623
40. 164
“They are these practitioners who are dwelling and practicing within
various divine palaces of the Dharma in this assembly of followers through
their practice of various kinds of liberations.”

40. 165
The night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā, in order to teach
further the bodhisattva liberation called the arising of the vast radiating light of
joy, recited these verses to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son: [F.178.b]
40. 166
“Son of the jinas, with my vast sight
I am looking into all directions
At the vast ocean of realms of various kinds
And also the ocean of beings in saṃsāra. {71}
40. 167
“I see the spotless jinas in the vast extent of all realms
Present everywhere throughout the ten directions
Seated at the feet of Bodhi trees,
Teaching the Dharma and guiding beings. {72}
40. 168
“With the pure ocean of my hearing,
I hear all sounds without exception.
All the Dharma that is taught by the sugatas
I hear with delight again and again. {73}
40. 169
“My nondual, unimpeded knowledge
Enters the field of the minds of other beings.
I comprehend the entirety of the characteristics1624
Of the vast ocean of the minds of other beings. {74}
40. 170
“Through the power of memory and samādhi
I know the ocean of countless kalpas in the past.
And similarly I know the ocean of the successions
Of the many lifetimes of myself and of others. {75}
40. 171
“I know in a single instant kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms,
The existences of beings within saṃsāra,
And the buddhas and their hosts of miraculous manifestations. {76}
40. 172
“I also remember the first aspirations
Made by the knowers of the world,
Their vast ways of attainment and engagement,
And how through conduct they accomplished the accumulations. {77}
40. 173
“In a single instant of mind I comprehend
The vast ways of enlightenment and buddhahood
Of all those who have reached the level of empowerment
Of having an ocean of unequaled, immeasurable qualities. {78}
40. 174
“I know how the sugatas, through various methods,


---

Turn the supreme wheel for beings,
The measureless qualities of their nirvāṇas,
And the length of time their Dharma remains. {79}
40. 175
“I comprehend individually, through various ways,
The ocean of the ways of their stainless yānas,
All their vast guidance for beings,
And the teachings they give to beings. {80} [F.179.a]
40. 176
“I have meditated for many hundreds of kalpas
On the way of this liberation of the illumination
Of the treasure of delight and the wealth of aspiration.1625
You too should quickly comprehend this way. {81}
40. 177
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the arising of the vast
radiating light of joy. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities
of bodhisattvas who at the feet of all the tathāgatas engage in an ocean of
prayers to enter omniscience; who complete the fulfillment of the ocean of
the past prayers by the tathāgatas; who are skilled in reaching the ocean of
all bodhisattva bhūmis through reaching one bodhisattva bhūmi; who have
pure prayer and conduct in which there is an ocean of all bodhisattva
conducts included within each conduct; who have the power of practice of
the entire ocean of bodhisattva liberations being included within each
bodhisattva liberation?
40. 178
“Depart, noble one. The goddess of the night who has the name Sarva-
jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā has come to this bodhimaṇḍa and is in
the presence of the Bhagavat. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a
bodhisattva ripen beings for the highest, complete enlightenment? How
should a bodhisattva purify all buddha realms? How should a bodhisattva
honor and serve all tathāgatas so as to please them? How should a
bodhisattva be dedicated to the Dharma
 of all the buddhas?’ ” [F.179.b]
1626
40. 179
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the night
goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā, circumambulated the night
goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā many hundreds of thousands
of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again,
departed from the night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā.
