Chapter 39
SARVA NAGARA RAKṢĀ SAṂBHAVA TEJAḤ ŚRĪ
39. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was meditating on, familiarizing himself
with,
 and cultivating the bodhisattva liberation called the display in each
instant of mind of the arising of the power of vast delight. He was following,
remembering, [F.148.a] and comprehending the instruction and teachings of
the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī, remembering each word and
letter, the numerous countless aspects, the knowledge of the aspects of the
nature of phenomena, and he was relying on it through his memory,
analyzing 
it 
with 
his 
intelligence, 
comprehending 
it 
with 
his
understanding,
 increasing it with his intellect, feeling it with his body,
practicing it, and engaging in it, and eventually he arrived where the night
goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī was.
1529

39. 2
He saw the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī seated
upon a great lotus throne containing the kings of precious jewels that
illuminate towns and dwellings, with an entourage of countless night
goddesses, with a body that appeared in all directions to all beings, with a
body that had the forms of those of all beings, with a body that appeared
before all beings, with a body that was unstained by all beings, with a body
that had the same nature as that of all beings, with a body that was superior
to those of all beings, with a body of the kind that could ripen and guide all
beings, with a body through which she spoke to all beings, with a body that
did not pass away among all beings, with a body that had vanquished all
obscurations, with a body that had the nature of the ultimate nature of
things,
 with a body that had reached the conclusion of guiding all beings.
1531
39. 3
When Sudhana saw her, he was filled with joy, delighted, elated, pleased,
and happy. He bowed his head to the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā-
saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī’s feet, circumambulated the night goddess Sarva nagara-
rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī many hundreds of thousands of times, and then
stood before the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī.

39. 4
With his hands placed together in homage, [F.148.b] he said, “Goddess! I
have entered upon the highest, complete enlightenment. Goddess, I pray
that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct
so that they will be a medicine
 for beings. How do bodhisattvas gather
beings into the highest gathering? How do bodhisattvas, authorized by the
tathāgatas, dedicate themselves to bodhisattva conduct so that, having
become dedicated, they become kings of the Dharma.
1532
39. 5
The night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī said to Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you ask
about conduct that is a rain from clouds of Dharma that accords with the
aspiration of the entire ocean of beings, so as to reach the conclusion of
ripening and guiding all beings; so as to reach the conclusion of joining and
maintaining the family of the tathāgatas; so as to conjoin with the wisdom
that pervades throughout the extent of the directions; so as to focus on
comprehending the entire ocean of the ways of the realm of the Dharma; so
as to pervade the infinity of all that can be known, which is as vast as the
extent of space; and so as to obtain and possess the wheels of Dharma of all
the tathāgatas.
39. 6
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the entry into
beautiful sounds and profound manifestations.
39. 7
“Noble one, through this liberation I undertake being on the unimpeded
level of a dharmabhāṇaka. I have the aspiration to make a gift of the Dharma
treasure of all the tathāgatas. I have attained the power of great love and
compassion. [F.149.a] I am dedicated to activities that benefit all beings in
order to bring all beings to the aspiration for enlightenment. I remain on the
level of a guide for beings so that they will continuously gather the
accumulation of the roots of merit of the aspiration for enlightenment. In
order to bring all beings onto the path to omniscience, I engage in causing
the sun of the Dharma to appear out of the clouds of the Dharma in the
world. I continuously engage in a motivation that regards all beings as equal
in order to illuminate all worlds with countless roots of merit. I am conjoined
with a pure motivation so that all beings will know the accomplishment of
accumulating roots of merit. I engage in being a leader of the caravan of all
beings so that they will appropriately accomplish all the paths of good
actions; I am engaged in the activity of causing all beings to reject all paths
of bad actions and be established in the Dharma of good actions. I am
engaged in teaching the path to happiness to all beings. I bring all beings to
the beginning of the array of the yānas. I am engaged in establishing all
beings in all virtuous Dharma practices. I am engaged in providing
unceasing service and veneration to all kalyāṇamitras. I am engaged in
establishing all beings in the teaching of the tathāgatas. I am engaged in


---

causing all beings to commence upon good qualities through receiving the
very first gift of the Dharma. I cause the arising of an aspiration for
omniscience that is enduring and indestructible. I have the vast domain of
the aspiration focused on the strengths of the Buddha, which is as enduring
and solid as the most powerful vajra, [F.149.b] and I practice by relying on a
kalyāṇamitra.
39. 8
“I have a mind that shatters the mountain of all the obscurations from
karma and kleśas. I am dedicated to the accumulation of omniscience. I am
engaged in accomplishing all good qualities. I am dedicated to being
engaged in a mind that is focused on and aspires for omniscience that has no
end or center.
39. 9
“Noble one, in that way, I am purifying the revelation to all beings of the
gateway to the light of the Dharma, and I am establishing them in gathering
the accumulation of roots of merit.
39. 10
“I look upon, comprehend, and fathom the realm of phenomena in ten
ways. What are those ten? (1) I comprehend the realm of phenomena
because I have attained the vast light of wisdom. (2) I comprehend the realm
of phenomena as having no end and no center in order to perceive the
miraculous manifestations of all the tathāgatas. (3) I comprehend the realm
of phenomena as limitless in order to reach all buddha realms and to make
offerings and show veneration to the tathāgatas. (4) I comprehend the realm
of phenomena as having no boundary in order to have the vision of
bodhisattva activities within the ocean of all worlds. (5) I comprehend the
realm of phenomena as being without division in order to enter the
undivided domain of wisdom of the tathāgatas. (6) I comprehend the realm
of phenomena as singleness [F.150.a] in order to enter the domain of speech
of the tathāgatas, which is perceived by all beings in accordance with their
aspirations. (7) I comprehend the realm of phenomena as having a nature of
vastness
 in order to realize the ultimate conclusion of the past prayers of
the tathāgatas to reach the conclusion of guiding all beings. (8) I
comprehend the realm of phenomena as having the equality of all beings in
order to realize the vast extent of completely good bodhisattva conduct. (9) I
comprehend the realm of phenomena as a single adornment in order to
comprehend the adornment of the miraculous manifestations of completely
good conduct. (10) I comprehend the realm of phenomena as being
indestructible
 in order for the pure pervasion of the realm of phenomena
by all good actions to have the nature of indestructibility.
1533
1534
39. 11
“Noble one, I look upon, comprehend, and fathom the entire realm of
phenomena in those ten ways in order to gather all the accumulations of
good karma, in order to comprehend the greatness of the buddhas, and in
order to realize the inconceivable scope of the buddhas.


---

39. 12
“Moreover, noble one, I teach the Dharma to beings with my mind fixed
upon the greatness of the tathāgatas and through ten-thousandfold domains
of the activity of mental retention. What are those ten? They are (1) the
domain of mental retention called the gathering of the entire ocean of the Dharma,
(2) the domain of mental retention called the blessing of all dharmas, (3) the
domain of mental retention called the holding of all dharmas, (4) the domain of
mental retention called the lamp of the intention of all the tathāgatas, (5) the
domain of mental retention called the essence that illuminates the ocean of the
karma of all beings, [F.150.b] (6) the domain of mental retention called the
fathoming of the entire stainless ocean of the ways of the yānas,
 (7) the domain of
mental retention called the proclamation of the turning
 of the wheel of the names
of all the buddhas, (8) the domain of mental retention called the fathoming of the
teaching of the ocean of the past prayers of the buddhas in the three times, (9) the
domain of mental retention called the intense power of the gathering of all dharmas,
and (10) the domain of mental retention called the arising of the power of
omniscience.
1535
1536
39. 13
“Noble one, I teach the Dharma to beings through these ten domains of
mental retention and the rest of the ten thousand domains of mental
retention.
39. 14
“Moreover, noble one, I teach the Dharma to beings through the wisdom
that comes from hearing the Dharma. I teach the Dharma to beings through
the wisdom from contemplation and the wisdom from meditation.
39. 15
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with one existence. I teach the
Dharma to beings beginning with all existences.
39. 16
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the ocean of the wheel of
names of one tathāgata. I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the
ocean of the wheel of names of all tathāgatas.
39. 17
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with one ocean of world realms. I
teach the Dharma to beings beginning with all oceans of world realms.
39. 18
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the ocean of prophecies of
one buddha. I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the ocean of
prophecies of all tathāgatas.
39. 19
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the ocean of the community
of the followers of one tathāgata. [F.151.a] I teach the Dharma to beings
beginning with the ocean of the communities of the followers of all
tathāgatas.
39. 20
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the Dharma wheel of one
tathāgata. I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the ocean of the
Dharma wheels of all tathāgatas.


---

39. 21
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with one sūtra. I teach the
Dharma to beings beginning with the sūtras that are present within the
Dharma wheels of all tathāgatas.
39. 22
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the gathering of the
community of followers of one tathāgata. I teach the Dharma to beings
beginning with the ocean of the gatherings of the communities of followers
of all tathāgatas.
39. 23
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with one aspiration to
omniscience. I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with the entire ocean
of the aspects of the aspiration to enlightenment.
39. 24
“I teach the Dharma to beings beginning with one yāna. I teach the
Dharma to beings beginning with the ocean of the arising of all yānas.
39. 25
“Noble one, in that way, I teach the Dharma to beings through
comprehending that in the way of the realm of the Dharma there is no
differentiation in the ocean of the tathāgatas. Thereby I create an
unsurpassable accumulation of the Dharma, continue with the bodhisattva’s
completely good conduct throughout all future kalpas, and meditate on this
bodhisattva liberation called the entry into beautiful sounds and profound
manifestations, expanding with each instant of mind the way of meditation on
the vista of this liberation, with each instant of mind expanding throughout
the entire realm of phenomena the way of meditation on the vista of this
liberation.” [F.151.b]
39. 26
Sudhana said, “Goddess, it is wonderful that this bodhisattva liberation is
so profound. Āryā, how long has it been since you attained this bodhisattva
liberation?”
She replied, “Noble one, in the past, in time gone by, beyond as many
kalpas as there are atoms in a world realm, there was a world realm called
Dharmārci nagara meghā, which had as many clouds of perfumed jewels as
there are atoms in a four-continent world realm. It was bordered with lotuses
that had been proclaimed in the past prayers of all the tathāgatas. Its body
was formed from the ocean as the king of precious jewels, having arisen
from the ocean of the karma of all beings. It had the shape of a great lotus. It
was both pure and defiled.
 It had as many encircling Cakravāla mountain
ranges of lotuses as there are atoms in Sumeru. It was adorned by as many
risen Sumerus of perfumed jewels as there are atoms in Sumeru. It was
adorned by as many great four-continent worlds as there are atoms in
Sumeru. In each four-continent world there was an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of
quintillions of cities.
1537
39. 27
“Noble one, there was in that world realm a kalpa called Vimalābha.
During that kalpa there appeared as many tathāgatas as there are atoms in
Sumeru. In the center of that world realm called Dharmārci nagara meghā
1538


---

there was a four-continent world called Vicitra dhvaja, in the center of which
was the royal capital called Samanta ratna kusuma prabhā.
39. 28
“Not far from that royal capital was a bodhimaṇḍa called Dharma rāja-
bhavana pratibhāsa. [F.152.a] At that bodhimaṇḍa there appeared the
Tathāgata Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa prabha rāja, the first of the tathāgatas
of that kalpa, who were as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru.
39. 29
“At that time there was a cakravartin king by the name of Vimala-
vakrabhānu prabha, who received from the Tathāgata Sarva dharma sāgara-
nirghoṣa prabha rāja the sūtra called The Ocean of All Dharmas. After he had
received it, after the Dharma wheel was turned, and after the passing into
nirvāṇa, the king entered homelessness and possessed all the teaching.
39. 30
“At the time when the teaching was reaching its end, it divided into a
thousand teachings, and in each teaching there was a division into a
thousand ways of teaching. During the intermediate kalpa of deterioration,
beings were obscured by the obscurations of karma and kleśas, and they
were engaged in fighting, quarreling, and disruption. Bhikṣus were not
concerned with the good qualities of the Buddha’s teachings but were
dedicated to delighting in the objects of the senses, engaged in
conversations about kings and thieves, were interested in stories about
women and countries and oceans, and used the words of the Lokāyatas.
39. 31
“The follower of the Dharma cried out, ‘Oh! The great lamp of the Dharma,
which has been established for many kalpas, is close to being extinguished!’
Having said these sad words, he rose into the air to the height of seven palm
trees and emanated clouds of light of infinite colors. When he had emanated
that great display of a net of light rays of various colors, [F.152.b] those
multicolored lights pacified the torment of the kleśas in the world and
established beings without end or center in enlightenment, which revived
the teachings of the tathāgata so that it remained for a further sixty thousand
years.
39. 32
“At that time, the cakravartin king Vimala vakrabhānu prabha’s daughter, a
bhikṣuṇī by the name of Dharma cakra nirmāṇa prabhā, had an entourage of a
hundred thousand bhikṣuṇīs. When she heard those sad words and saw
that miraculous manifestation, she and her entourage developed the
aspiration for enlightenment, and the hundred thousand bhikṣuṇīs became
irreversible on the path to the highest, complete enlightenment and attained
the samādhi called the manifest presence of the tathāgatas. They also obtained the
power of mental retention called the light emanated from the Dharma wheel of all
the tathāgatas. They also attained the perfection of wisdom called the entry into
all the ways of the ocean of the Dharma. The bhikṣuṇī Dharma cakra nirmāṇa-
prabhā attained the samādhi called the lamp of the light that arises from the
teachings of all the tathāgatas, and she attained in a subtle and gentle way this


---

bodhisattva liberation called the entry into beautiful sounds and profound
manifestations. When she had attained that, she directly perceived all the
miraculous manifestations of the Tathāgata Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa-
prabha rāja.
39. 33
“Noble one, what do you think? At that time, in that time, who do you
think was the cakravartin king Vimala vakrabhānu prabha, who entered
homelessness in the teaching of the Tathāgata Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa-
prabha rāja [F.153.a] and, after the turning of the wheel of the Dharma and the
passing into nirvāṇa, when the teachings were coming to an end, lit the
Dharma lamp of holding the teaching? Noble one, do not think that he was
anyone else; at that time, in that time, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra was
the cakravartin king Vimala vakrabhānu prabha.
39. 34
“Noble one, what do you think? At that time, in that time, who do you
think was the bhikṣuṇī Dharma cakra nirmāṇa prabhā, the daughter of the
cakravartin king Vimala vakrabhānu prabha, who had an entourage of a
hundred thousand bhikṣuṇīs? Noble one, do not think that she was anyone
else; at that time, in that time, I was the bhikṣuṇī Dharma cakra nirmāṇa-
prabhā. In that way, I held the teaching of the Tathāgata Sarva dharma-
sāgara nirghoṣa prabha rāja. I caused those hundred thousand bhikṣuṇīs to
progress irreversibly toward the highest, complete enlightenment. I
established them in the samādhi called the manifest presence of the tathāgatas. I
also established them in the power of mental retention called the light
emanated from the Dharma wheel of all tathāgatas and the perfection of wisdom
called the entry into all the ways of the ocean of the Dharma.
39. 35
“After that tathāgata, I venerated the Tathāgata Vimala dharma parvata-

“In that way, noble one, there were these hundred buddhas and the other
tathāgatas, as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru, who appeared in the kalpa
called Vimalābha.


---

39. 37
“Noble one, the last of those tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in
Sumeru was a tathāgata by the name of Dharma dhātu nagarābha jñāna-
pradīpa rāja. [F.156.b]
39. 38
“In that way, noble one, I made offerings to those tathāgatas as numerous
as the atoms in Sumeru, beginning with Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa prabha-
rāja and ending with Dharma dhātu nagarābha jñāna pradīpa rāja. I attended to
all those tathāgatas. I heard the Dharma taught by them all. I entered
homelessness in the teachings of all those tathāgatas. I possessed the
teachings of all those tathāgatas. I obtained the bodhisattva liberation called
the entry into beautiful sounds and profound manifestations from all those
tathāgatas, obtaining it in various ways. At the feet of all those tathāgatas I
ripened an ocean of beings without edge or center.
39. 39
“Since then, in practicing the Dharma I have made offerings to as many
buddhas as have appeared throughout as many kalpas as there are atoms in
a buddha realm.
39. 40
“Noble one, during that time, I have watched over beings as they slept in
ignorance in the darkness of saṃsāra. I have guarded the cities of their
minds. I have brought them up out of the city of the three realms and
brought them into the city of omniscience.

“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the entry into
beautiful sounds and profound manifestations, which prevents meaningless
worldly talk, establishes speech that is not dishonest, and concludes with it
being firmly established in truth. [F.157.a] How could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who know without impediment all
languages,
 who understand all Dharma in each instant of mind, who
comprehend all the words and languages of all beings, who are skilled in
accumulating the entire ocean of languages, who are skilled in the ways and
practices of an ocean of numbers and terms in all Dharmas, who have the
power of an ocean of mental retention that engages with all the Dharma,
who are skilled in creating clouds of Dharma that accord with the
dispositions of all beings, and who have fully attained ripening and guiding
all beings? How could I know their practice of gathering all beings, their
application 
to 
undertaking 
supreme 
bodhisattva 
activity,
 
their
comprehension of very subtle bodhisattva knowledge, their power of
supremacy in opening the treasures and treasuries of bodhisattva Dharma,
or their ascending the lion throne for teaching the bodhisattva Dharma?
1541
1542
39. 42
“Why is that? It is because those excellent beings have all attained the
retention of the domain of the level of the entire Dharma.
39. 43
“Depart, noble one. Here at the feet of the Bhagavat Vairocana, there is the
goddess of the night who has the name Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha-
saṃvāsā. She is not far from me, so go to her and ask her, ‘How should

bodhisattvas
 train in omniscience? How should they practice it so as to
bring all beings to omniscience?’ ” [F.157.b]
1543
39. 44
Then at that time, the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī,
in order to teach further the bodhisattva liberation called the entry into
beautiful sounds and profound manifestations, recited these verses to Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son:
39. 45
“Profound and difficult to see is the bodhisattvas’ liberation
By which they know every jina in the three times,
The entire realm of phenomena without edge or center,
And the complete extent of the characteristics of all cognition.
 {1}
1544
39. 46
“The ways of the liberation that arise from the accumulations are infinite.
They are inconceivable and immeasurable, for they attain
 the true nature.
1545
You should enter into the paths of the ways of love in the three times
That completely increase power that is unimpeded. {2}
39. 47
“There was a realm in the past, beyond as many kalpas
As there are atoms that exist in a buddha realm;
That glorious
 world realm was Dharmārci megha nagara,
1546
And there was a very bright kalpa called Vimalābha. {3}
39. 48
“In that one kalpa there appeared an unbroken succession of jinas,
As many buddhas as there are atoms in Sumeru.
First to appear, the first in that kalpa,
Was the Sugata Dharma samudra prabha garjita rāja. {4}
39. 49
“The last of those tathāgatas to appear in the world
Was the Jina Dharma megha nagarābha pradīpa rāja.
I came before them all and made offerings to them.
From them all I heard the Dharma with great joy. {5}
39. 50
“First I saw, having a golden light,
Dharma samudra prabha garjita rāja,
Adorned with the thirty-two signs and resembling Meru,
And seeing him I thought, ‘I shall become a sugata!’ {6}
39. 51
“The very moment I saw that tathāgata,
There arose the powerful first aspiration to become a jina
Who had the character of the true nature, as vast
 as space, [F.158.a]
1547
Because of the all-pervading arising of omniscience. {7}
39. 52
“All of the sugatas within the three times,
Encircled by oceans of all the bodhisattvas,


---

The extensive ocean of realms with their oceans of beings,
Have arisen from the great ocean of the amrita of compassion. {8}
39. 53
“I also aspired that in order to ripen beings
I would pervade every single realm with my body,
Manifest a body to beings in accordance with their aspirations,
And illuminate and shake every single realm. {9}
39. 54
“I also came before the second buddha
And saw jina lords in ten oceans of realms.
I saw the last jina within an ocean of realms
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms. {10}
39. 55
“Since then, during kalpas as numerous as a realm’s atoms,
I have gone before and made offerings to
All of the jinas, the lamps of the world, who appeared
And purified an ocean of ways of liberation.” {11}
39. 56
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, attained this bodhisattva liberation
called the entry into beautiful sounds and profound manifestations, attained an
endless, centerless ocean of samādhis, gained an understanding that arose
from a vast ocean of gateways to retention, attained the great illumination of
a bodhisattva’s higher cognitions, and entered an ocean of great
discernment,
 and in his mind spread a vast ocean of powerful delight.
1548
39. 57
He then praised the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī by
reciting these appropriate verses:
39. 58
“Your wisdom is active in a vast ocean of the Dharma.
You practice in the centerless, endless ocean of existences.
The essence of your perfect wisdom body lives long without illness. [F.158.b]
Goddess, you have come and beautified this assembly. {12}
39. 59
“You have realized the nature of phenomena to be like space.
You realize without impediment the ways of all three times.
In each instant of mind there are inconceivable, countless
Perceptions, all of which are without conceptualization. {13}
39. 60
“With your wisdom eyes you see the true nature in which there are no
beings,
Yet you perceive with compassion the infinite ocean of beings.
You enter the very vast
 liberation of your mind,
1549
And you guide and ripen countless beings. {14}
39. 61
“You know through analyzing the field of phenomena.


---

You have realized the way of knowing the nature of phenomena.
You meditate on all the stainless paths of the āryas.
You purify all beings without exception and liberate them. {15}
39. 62
“You have realized the stainless wisdom of omniscience.
Goddess, you have become the supreme guide
 of beings.
1550
You pervade all beings within the realm of phenomena
And teach them the Dharma and end all fear in the world. {16}
39. 63
“Goddess, through the way of the prayers of Vairocana,
You have a vast,
 stainless, unimpeded, exact understanding.
1551
You have understood the power
 of the omnipresent jinas,
1552
And you see the miraculous manifestation of the jinas in all realms. {17}
39. 64
“Your mind is as invincible as space.
You are primordially pure, unstained by the stains of the kleśas.
Within it appear all the realms of the three times
And the assemblies of all buddhas and bodhisattvas. {18}
39. 65
“Within each instant there are days and nights and months,
In each moment years and the creation and destruction of kalpas.
You know an ocean of kalpas, their ocean of names and numbers,
And the ocean of the perceptions of beings, within each instant. {19}
39. 66
“You know the births and deaths of beings in all directions,
Those with and without form, with and without perception, [F.159.a]
Those who follow the way of belief in reality.
You show them the path and bring them to supreme enlightenment. {20}
39. 67
“Manifesting from the family of Vairocana’s net
 of prayers,
1553
Born from the single body of all the sugatas,
Your unimpeded mind is the pure Dharma body,
And you manifest your form body in all worlds according to aspirations.”
{21}
39. 68
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having praised the night goddess Sarva-
nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī with these appropriate verses, bowed his
head to the feet of the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī,
circumambulated the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī
many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking
back again and again, departed from the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā-
saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī. [B10]
