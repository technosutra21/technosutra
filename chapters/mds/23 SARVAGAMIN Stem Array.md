SARVAGAMIN
23. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, visualizing in his mind the upāsikā
Acalā, remembering the instruction of the upāsikā Acalā, with conviction in
and no doubt about what the upāsikā Acalā had taught, proclaimed,
instructed, described,
 sanctioned, established, explicated, stated, and
elaborated upon it; he followed it, contemplated it, comprehended it,
meditated on it, was absorbed in it,
 was fixed upon it, understood it,
illuminated it, and became equal to it.

23. 2
Eventually, traveling from district to district, going from land to land,
Sudhana arrived at the land called Amitatosala. He searched for the town
named Tosala, and at sunset he arrived at the town of Tosala. He entered the
town of Tosala and went to the crossroads in the center of the town. He
wandered from one street to another, from one crossroads to another, from
one lane to another, searching and inquiring. When it was night and people
were asleep, he saw to the north of the town of Tosala a hill called Sulabha.
Its summit was adorned by a delightful variety of grasses, bushes, and
herbs, and it shone as brightly as the sun. Seeing that light, he felt a powerful
joy and thought, “I will without doubt see the kalyāṇamitra on the summit of
that hill.” He came out of the town [F.43.b] and went to Sulabha Hill, and he
climbed up Sulabha Hill and arrived at the very bright summit of the hill. He
saw in the distance the parivrājaka Sarvagamin, who shone with splendor
and whose appearance was superior even to that of Mahābrahmā, and ten
thousand brahmins were walking in circumambulation around him.
23. 3
Sudhana approached him, bowed his head to his feet, circumambulated
him many hundreds of thousands of times, and sat down before him. With
his hands placed together in homage, he said, “Ārya, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
should practice it.

23. 4
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
23. 5
Sarvagamin said, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have in
that way set out upon the highest, complete enlightenment!
23. 6
“Noble one, I, Sarvagamin, remain within the all-pervading bodhisattva
conduct. I am endowed with the gateway of the samādhi called the light of the
practice of all gateways, with being established in the absence of existence, with
noncomposite miraculous powers, and with the gateway of the knowledge
of the perfection of wisdom that has reached the basis of the entire realm of
the Dharma.
23. 7
“Noble one, in that way I benefit beings in the entire array of worlds
inhabited by beings, in all the states of existences that beings are in, in all the
gateways of the deaths of beings, in all the gateways of the births of beings,
in all the different existences, in the various different abodes, and in the
worlds that are habitations —beings who have [F.44.a] various colors,
shapes, heights, and widths and who have entered various kinds of rebirths,
have different practices, and have different aspirations, which means those
within existence as a deva, those within existence as a nāga, those within
existence as a yakṣa, those within existence as a gandharva, those within
existence as an asura, those within existence as a garuḍa, those within
existence as a kinnara, those within existence as a mahoraga, those within
existence as a hell being, those within existence as an animal, those within
existence in the world of Yama, those within existence as a human, those
within existence as a nonhuman, those who have various false views, those
who aspire to the Śrāvakayāna, those who aspire to the Pratyeka-
buddhayāna, and those who aspire to the Mahāyāna —benefiting them
through various methods and through various introductions to the way of
wisdom.
23. 8
“This means that I benefit some beings with the light of the power of
mental retention
 that possesses all the knowledge of the various crafts so
that they will learn the various worldly crafts.
1083
23. 9
“I benefit some beings through the application of the four methods of
gathering pupils, which means leading them to omniscient wisdom.
“I benefit some beings by describing the perfections, thus generating the
light of the gateway
 of the wisdom that transforms into omniscience.
1084
23. 10
“I benefit some beings by describing the aspiration to enlightenment, thus
developing an imperishable, strengthened seed of enlightenment.
“I benefit some beings by describing all the aspects of bodhisattva
conduct, thus generating the aspiration to purify all buddha realms and
ripen all beings. [F.44.b]

23. 11
“I benefit some beings by causing dismay, by teaching the sufferings
experienced by beings in the hells caused by the ripening of their bad
conduct.
“I benefit some beings by causing delight, by describing all the qualities
that arise in the tathāgatas,
 which are the ultimate result of definite
omniscience.
1085
23. 12
“I benefit some beings by speaking praises of the qualities of all the
tathāgatas, thus generating the aspiration to omniscience and the longing
for the qualities and body of a buddha.
23. 13
“I benefit some beings by describing the greatness of the buddhas, thus
generating the longing to attain the body of a buddha that possesses the
power to undertake continuous, irresistible buddha activity.
23. 14
“I benefit some beings by describing the dominance of the buddhas, thus
generating the aspiration to attain the perfect body of a buddha, which
cannot be surpassed but surpasses all others.
23. 15
“Moreover, noble one, I manifest a body of the size and shape that accords
[F.45.a] with the aspirations, activities, powers, and conducts of all the men,
women, boys, and girls who are gathered in all the crossroads, streets,
junctions, side streets, houses, trades, districts, and dwellings in the districts
of this town of Tosala, and I teach them the Dharma. Those beings do not
know who has taught them or where he has come from, but otherwise
having heard me, they all practice correctly.1086
23. 16
“Moreover, noble one, I go everywhere in this Jambudvīpa in order to
ripen those who are attached to the ninety-six varieties of heretical
 views.
1087
23. 17
“Noble one, in the same way that I benefit beings in this town of Tosala, I
benefit beings in all the villages, markets,
 towns, lands, kingdoms, and
capitals in Jambudvīpa. In the same way that I benefit beings in Jambudvīpa,
I do so in the entire four-continent world realm, and in a thousand such
world realms, and in a million, and in the great world realms of a billion such
world realms. In the same way, I benefit beings according to their aspirations
in all the world realms in the ten directions, in all the habitations of beings, in
all the dwellings of beings, in all the locations of beings, in all that are
known as the abodes of beings, in all the residences of beings, in all the
congregations of beings, in all the oceans of beings, in all the lineages of
beings, in all the directions of beings, in all the intermediate directions of
beings, and in all the conducts of beings. I benefit beings through various
methods, various ways, various gateways, various kinds of logic, various
connections, various ways of methods, and various actions. I benefit beings
through the manifestation of various attractive physical forms and colors. I
benefit beings through speaking in various languages. [F.45.b]

23. 18
“Noble one, in that way, I know this bodhisattva conduct that is all-
pervasive
 and omnipresent, but how could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of those bodhisattvas who possess bodies that are the
same as those of all beings; who have attained the samādhi called identical to
the bodies of all beings; who pervade all the classes of existence with a vast
wheel of emanations; who perform in their own bodies all worldly births;
who are dedicated to the wheel of beautiful emanations that all beings
delight to see; who manifest births in the families, clans, and lives of all
beings; who possess the unimpeded wheel of aspiration to dwell in all
kalpas; who have attained the radiance of the display of conduct that is like
an illusion; who are dedicated to benefiting all beings and yet remain
stainless; who have realized the equality of all the realms of beings in the
three times; who possess the essence of infinite compassion illuminated by
the realm of the wisdom of selflessness; and who are dedicated to
generating the roots of merit of all beings?
1089
23. 19
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in a land called Pṛthurāṣṭra,
there dwells a perfume-seller head merchant by the name of Utpalabhūti. Go
to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
23. 20
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
parivrājaka Sarvagamin, circumambulated the parivrājaka Sarvagamin a
hundred thousand times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again
and again, departed from the presence of the parivrājaka Sarvagamin.
