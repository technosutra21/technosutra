MEGHAŚRĪ
4. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, eventually arrived at the land
called Rāmāvarānta. Having arrived there, he traveled through the land of
Rāmāvarānta. Enjoying the delightful pleasures that arose from his past
roots of merit and through the power of vast karma, he came to Sugrīva
Mountain. He climbed Sugrīva Mountain and, seeking the bhikṣu Meghaśrī,
he went to its eastern side. In the same way, he went to its southern,
western, 
northern, 
northeastern, 
southeastern, 
southwestern, 
and
northwestern sides, looking up and down for the bhikṣu Meghaśrī.
4. 2
After seven days had passed, he saw the bhikṣu Meghaśrī walking on a
plateau
 on the summit of another mountain.

4. 3
He went to where the bhikṣu Meghaśrī was and bowed his head to the
bhikṣu Meghaśrī’s feet. He circumambulated the bhikṣu Meghaśrī, keeping
him to his right. He sat before him and with palms pressed together said,
“Ārya, I wish to know this: When bodhisattvas have developed the
aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment, how do bodhisattvas
train in bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas practice it? How do
bodhisattvas commence in bodhisattva conduct? [F.325.a] How do
bodhisattvas practice bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas perfect
bodhisattva conduct? How do they purify it? How do they enter it? How do
they attain it? How do they follow it? How do they maintain
 it? How do
they increase it? How do bodhisattvas perfect the domain of completely
good conduct?
341
4. 4
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas set out for the
highest, complete enlightenment!”
4. 5
The bhikṣu Meghaśrī said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble
one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment and are asking about the bodhisattva

conduct.
4. 6
“Noble one, it is like this: these are difficult, extremely difficult —seeking
the bodhisattva conduct, seeking the bodhisattva’s scope of activity, seeking
the bodhisattva’s pure setting-forth, seeking the bodhisattva’s pure path,
seeking the bodhisattva’s pure, vast conduct, seeking the bodhisattva’s pure
attainment of the higher cognitions, manifesting the bodhisattva’s
liberations, manifesting the bodhisattva’s continuum
 of compassion for
the world,
 the bodhisattva’s compliance with the aspirations of beings,
[F.325.b] the bodhisattva’s revelation of the gateways to saṃsāra and
nirvāṇa, and seeking the bodhisattva’s activities that are unstained by
composite defects, noncomposite defects, and fear.

4. 7
“Noble one, through the power and might of my aspiration, through
having the pure eyes of wisdom and the pure eyes of faith, and by looking
straight ahead with the illumination of the light of wisdom, perceiving
everything before me, the entire unobstructed field of vision, with a sight
that is free of all obscuration, with astute observation, with a completely pure
field of vision, and with a pure body, and bowing down toward the extent of
every direction with a skillful bowing-down of the body, with the power of
retaining the clouds of Dharma of all the buddhas, and with the might of the
power of retention, I see the tathāgatas in the realms in every direction
before me.
4. 8
“In that way, I see one tathāgata in the eastern direction; I see two
buddhas, ten buddhas, a hundred buddhas, a thousand buddhas, a hundred
thousand buddhas, ten million buddhas, a billion buddhas, ten thousand
million buddhas, a trillion buddhas, a quintillion buddhas, and so on up to
limitless, immeasurable, countless, inconceivable, unequaled, infinite,
endless, incalculable, and more indescribable than indescribable numbers of
buddhas.
4. 9
“I see tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in Jambudvīpa, tathāgatas as
numerous as the atoms in the world realm of four continents, in the world
realm of a thousand four-continent worlds, in the world realm of a million
four-continent worlds, and in the world realm of a billion four-continent
worlds. [F.326.a]
4. 10
“I see buddhas as numerous as the atoms in ten buddha realms. I see
buddhas as numerous as the atoms in a hundred buddha realms. I see
buddhas as numerous as the atoms in a thousand buddha realms. I see

numerous as the atoms in more indescribable than indescribable numbers of
buddha realms.
4. 11
“Just as I see in the east, in the south, in the west, in the north, in the
northeast, in the southeast, in the southwest, in the northwest, below, and
above, I see one tathāgata and so on up to tathāgatas as numerous as the
atoms in more indescribable than indescribable numbers of buddha realms.
4. 12
“In each direction I see tathāgatas of various colors, of various shapes,
with various miraculous powers, with various majestic miracles, with various
assemblies of followers, shining with networks of many light rays in many
colors, in infinite colors, in an array of different pure buddha realms and
palaces, with different kinds of pure lifespans, addressing
 beings in
accordance with their aspirations, [F.326.b] manifesting different kinds of
miracles through the pure attainment of buddhahood, and resounding with
the majestic lion’s roar of the buddhas.
344
4. 13
“In that way, noble one, I have attained mindfulness of the buddhas
through beholding the aggregation of the knowledge of all objects of
perception from all sides.
4. 14
“But how could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the pure
domain of the infinite
 wisdom of the bodhisattvas who have attained the
gateway of mindfulness of the buddhas called the completely radiant domain
through seeing before them the domains of all the tathāgatas, all the
displays of pure buddha realms and palaces?
345
4. 15
“They are the ones who have attained the gateway of mindfulness of the
buddhas called all beings through their pure vision of the tathāgatas
addressing beings
 in accordance with their aspirations.

tathāgatas of all the kalpas.

the tathāgatas, resounding with their voices,
 throughout space in the
realm of phenomena.
349
4. 35
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a district called Sāgara-
mukha. There dwells a bhikṣu by the name of Sāgara megha. Go to him and
ask him, ‘How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a
bodhisattva practice it?’
4. 36
“Noble one, that kalyāṇamitra will explain it to you.
 He will reveal to
you the cause of the accumulation of merit. He will make you understand the
level
 of vast accumulation. He will describe the vast power and might of
roots of merit. [F.328.a] He will make known to you the vast cause for the
accumulation of the aspiration to enlightenment. He will provide the basis
for the cause of the great radiance of the Mahāyāna. He will enable in you
the vast power of the accumulation of the perfections. He will enable you to
purify your entry into the vast ocean of conduct. He will enable you to purify
a vast domain of aspirations. He will enable you to develop vast displays
that emerge from everywhere. He will augment the vast power of great
compassion.”

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Meghaśrī, circumambulated the bhikṣu Meghaśrī a hundred
thousand times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back a hundred
thousand times, departed from the bhikṣu Meghaśrī. [B28]
