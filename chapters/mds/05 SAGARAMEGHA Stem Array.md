SĀGARA MEGHA
5. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplated the instruction of
that kalyāṇamitra. He remembered the radiance of his wisdom.
 He
analyzed that bodhisattva’s liberation. He reflected on
 the bodhisattva’s
way of samādhi. He looked at the way of an ocean of bodhisattvas. He
aspired toward the domain of buddhahood. He delighted in the direction of
the vision of the buddhas. He contemplated the ocean of buddhas. He
remembered the succession of buddhas. He comprehended that which is
understood in the way of the buddhas.
 He looked into the sky of the
buddhas.

5. 2
Eventually he arrived in the area called Sāgara mukha [F.328.b] and went to
where the bhikṣu Sāgara megha was. He bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Sāgara megha, circumambulated him many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping him to his right, sat before him, and with palms together said,
“Ārya, I am set on the highest, complete enlightenment. I seek to enter the
ocean of the highest wisdom. However, I do not know how bodhisattvas
turn away from worldly existences and attain
 the family of the tathāgatas;
how they cross the ocean of existence and enter the ocean of omniscience;
how they transcend the level of foolish, ordinary beings and attain the family
of the tathāgatas; how they turn away from the flow
 of saṃsāra and enter
the flow of bodhisattva conduct; how they turn back from the wheel of the
continuum of saṃsāra’s ocean and enter
 the wheel of bodhisattva conduct
and aspiration; how they defeat all the domains of the māras and manifest
the arising
 of all the domains of the buddhas; how they dry up the ocean
of existences and expand the ocean of great compassion; how they shut the
gateway to all unfortunate existences, lower existences, and downfalls and
open the gateway to the higher existences and nirvāṇa; how they destroy
355

the gateway to the city of the three realms and open the gateway to the
palace of omniscience; how they reject craving for all things and develop the
aspiration to gather all beings.”
5. 3
After he had said that, the bhikṣu Sāgara megha said to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, [F.329.a] “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.
“Noble one, the beings who have not planted roots of merit do not
develop the aspiration for enlightenment.359
5. 4
“The aspiration for enlightenment is developed by those beings who have
attained the complete illumination, by the roots of merit, of all gateways,
who are illuminated by the light of the wisdom of the samādhi of the path
that has the essence of methods, who have accumulated a vast accumulation
of an ocean of merit, who have a continuity of all good actions, who never
tire of relying on all the kalyāṇamitras, who have no concern for their own
bodies or lives, who are free from all fixation on things, whose minds are as
even as completely level ground, who possess a nature of compassion and
kindness, who are focused
 on all those dwelling in the states of existence,
and who long for the scope of activity of the tathāgatas.
360
5. 5
“In other words, they have developed a motivation of great compassion so
as to protect all beings. They have developed a motivation of great love so as
to treat all beings equally. They have developed the motivation to bring
happiness so as to bring to an end the mass of suffering of all beings. They
have developed the motivation to bring benefit so as to turn beings away
from all bad qualities. They have developed the motivation of sympathy so
as to protect from all fear. They have developed the motivation of
nonattachment so as to eliminate all obscurations. They have developed a
vast motivation so as to pervade the entire realm of phenomena. They have
developed an infinite motivation so as to extend throughout and be present
everywhere in the realm of space. They have developed a stainless
motivation so as to perceive the vision of all the tathāgatas. [F.329.b] They
have developed a pure motivation in order for their wisdom to extend
throughout the three times without exception. They have developed a
motivation for wisdom in order to dispel wisdom’s obscurations
 and enter
into an ocean of omniscient wisdom.

5. 6
“Noble one, for twelve years I have dwelled in this area called Sāgara-
mukha. I focused on the great ocean, facing it, and I contemplated the ocean
in this way: ‘It is vast and immeasurable; it is stainless and clear; it is deep
and unfathomable; it becomes steadily deeper and stays perfectly the same;
it is a source of a variety of many jewels; it is a limitless mass of water; it has


---

many different colors and is inconceivable; it has infinite spirits; it is the
dwelling place of a multitude of various creatures; it receives the rain from
great clouds; and it is neither filled nor diminished.’
5. 7
“Noble one, I thought, ‘Is there anything in this world realm that is greater
than this ocean? Is there something that is vaster, more measureless,
deeper,
 or more marvelous?’ While I was engaged in attention to this
through contemplation, there appeared a great lotus from under the great
ocean. It had a stem of unsurpassable precious sapphire jewels that was as
hard as diamond. It was adorned with great precious beryl jewels. It had vast
leaves of stainless Jambu River gold. It displayed a yellow sandalwood
pericarp
 and stamens of emerald jewels. It was as vast and large as the
ocean. A gathering of a million
 asura lords held the stem. It was covered
from above by a network of a million various jewels. [F.330.a] A million nāga
lords sent down a rain of incense. A million garuḍa lords hung from their
beaks streamers of silk and strings of jewels. A million kinnara lords looked
on with a wish to benefit. A million mahoraga lords encircled the lotus and
bowed down to it. A million rākṣasa lords bowed down and made offerings
to it. A million gandharva lords played music and sang various melodious
songs in praise and as an offering. A million deva lords sent down rain from
clouds of divine flowers, perfume, garlands, incense, ointments, powders,
clothing, parasols, banners, and divine flags. A million Brahmakāyika lords
reverently bowed their heads, paid homage, and made offerings. A million
Śuddhāvāsa devas placed their palms together and paid homage. A million
cakravartins, lords of humans, welcomed it with an offering of the seven
jewels, and a million ocean devas rose up and paid homage to it.
362
363
364
5. 8
“A million precious asteria jewels displaying light rays adorned it. A
million perfectly arranged precious jewels of pure merit
 beautified it. A
million radiant
 precious jewels were its stainless center. It blazed with a
million glorious precious jewels. It had the infinite shining of a million
variegated treasures of precious jewels. It was beautified by a perfectly
arranged display of a million precious Jambudvīpa
 jewels. [F.330.b] It had
an unsurpassable display of a million precious diamond
 jewels. It had a
plenitude of illustrious blazing precious sunstone jewels. It had an
arrangement of a million radiant precious jewels of various colors. It had the
unceasingly brightly shining display of a million precious wish-fulfilling
kings of jewels.

5. 9
“That great lotus had arisen from a tathāgata’s transcendent roots of merit
and remained through the aspiration of bodhisattvas. It could be perceived
in all directions. It had come forth as an illusory phenomenon. It had been
created from pure, stainless actions. It was the display of the unalloyed true
nature. It was produced like a phenomenon in a dream. It was sealed as


---

being a noncomposite phenomenon. It possessed the nature of being free of
attachment. It pervaded the domains of the directions throughout the vast
realm of phenomena. It accorded with the majestic radiance
 of the domain
of buddhahood. It would be impossible to fully comprehend its display of
form, qualities, shape, and colors even in hundreds of thousands of
asaṃkhyeya kalpas.
369
5. 10
“I saw the clear image of the body of a tathāgata sitting cross-legged on
that great lotus and filling it. I saw that tathāgata’s body extending from here
up to the summit of existence. I saw the inconceivable display of that
tathāgata’s seat. I saw the inconceivable circle of his followers, the
inconceivable extent of his halo, his inconceivable perfect primary signs of a
great being, his inconceivable various secondary features of a great being,
his inconceivable majesty and power, [F.331.a] his inconceivable miracles of
buddhahood, the inconceivable color of the tathāgata’s body, the
inconceivable invisible crown of his head,
 and his inconceivable vast
tongue.
370
5. 11
“I heard the inconceivable display of that buddha’s speech and the
inconceivable range of his voice. I comprehended his inconceivable limitless
strength, his inconceivable display of fearlessness, and his inconceivable
accomplishment of the power of discernment. I remembered his
inconceivable past accomplishment of bodhisattva conduct. I saw the
inconceivable miracle of his complete enlightenment. I heard the
inconceivable resounding of the thunder of Dharma and the inconceivable
array of the perceived communication of the complete teaching. I saw the
inconceivable, immeasurable right and left parts of his body and the
inconceivable accomplishment of a body that benefits beings.
5. 12
“That tathāgata extended his right hand and stroked my head and taught
me a Dharma teaching called All-Seeing Eyes, which is the field of all the
tathāgatas, reveals the conduct of bodhisattvas, illuminates the different
bases of the realm of phenomena,
 illuminates the compiled
 field of all
Dharmas, is the pure vision of the forms of the range of all realms, scatters
the entire range of adversaries, defeats the entire range of the discord of the
māras, [F.331.b] brings satisfaction to all realms of beings, illuminates the
darkness in the minds of all beings, communicates
 in accord with the
thoughts of all beings, and illuminates the turning wheel of the faculties of
all beings.
371
372
373
“I acquired, possess, follow, and contemplate this Dharma teaching called
All-Seeing Eyes.
5. 13
“Having thus acquired it, if one were to use a volume of ink equal to the
great ocean and a heap of pens the size of Sumeru, the king of mountains, to
write it out, one would not be able reach the end of a single chapter, a single


---

gateway, a single Dharma way, or a single category of words from that
Dharma teaching, nor could one diminish what is to be written, complete it,
finish it, or reach the end.
5. 14
“Noble one, in that way I have possessed this Dharma teaching called All-
Seeing Eyes for an entire twelve years. Having thus acquired it, in a single day
I can understand countless chapters through the illumination of the light of
the power of retention called remembering what is heard. I can comprehend
countless chapters through the illumination of the light of the power of
retention called the gateway to peace. I can fathom countless chapters through
the illumination of the light of the power of retention called endless revolving. I
can consider and investigate countless chapters through the illumination of
the light of the power of retention called examining and analyzing the levels. I
can conclude countless chapters through the illumination of the light of the
power of retention called majestic. I can accomplish countless chapters
through the illumination of the light of the power of retention called array of
lotuses. I can elucidate countless chapters through the illumination of the
light of the power of retention called distinct voice. I can distinguish countless
chapters through the illumination of the light of the power of retention
called the essence of space. I can expand on countless chapters through the
illumination of the light of the power of retention called the multitude of stars. I
can arrange countless chapters through the illumination of the light of the
power of retention called the essence of the ocean. [F.332.a]
5. 15
“Beings have arrived before me to the east. There are devas and deva
lords, nāgas and nāga lords, yakṣas and yakṣa lords, gandharvas and
gandharva lords, asuras and asura lords, garuḍas and garuḍa lords, kinnaras
and kinnara lords, mahoragas and mahoraga lords, humans and human
lords, brahmins and brahmin lords. I establish them in and bring them all
into this Dharma teaching called All-Seeing Eyes that illuminates the conduct
of the tathāgatas and bodhisattvas. For all of them I clarify, delineate,
elucidate, describe, teach,
 categorize, expand, reveal, expound, and
illuminate this Dharma teaching called All-Seeing Eyes.
374
5. 16
“As in the east, it is the same for the beings who arrive to the south, the
west, the north, the northeast, the southeast, the southwest, the northwest,
above, and below.
5. 17
“Noble one, in this way I know but one Dharma teaching. How could I
know the conduct or describe the qualities of bodhisattvas? They have
entered the ocean of bodhisattva conduct in order to gain pure aspiration;
they have entered the ocean of all aspirations in order to remain
continuously throughout all kalpas; they have entered the ocean of all
beings in order to follow a conduct that accords with their wishes; [F.332.b]
they have entered the ocean of the minds of all beings in order to


---

communicate wisdom; they have entered the ocean of all good qualities
 in
order to develop the unimpeded radiance of the wisdom of the ten strengths;
they have entered the ocean of the faculties of all beings in order not to miss
the time for ripening and guiding them; they have entered the ocean of
realms in order to fulfill the aspiration to purify all realms; they have entered
the ocean of buddhas in order to serve and make offerings to the tathāgatas;
they have entered the ocean of Dharma in order to communicate
 wisdom;
they have entered the ocean of good qualities in order to reach attainment;
and they have entered the ocean of the languages of beings in order to turn
the wheel of the Dharma in all languages.

5. 18
“Depart, noble one. Sixty yojanas from here on the road south, there is a
place named Sāgara tīra on the road to Laṅka. There dwells a bhikṣu by the
name of Supratiṣṭhita. Go to him and ask him, ‘How does a bodhisattva train
in bodhisattva conduct?’ ”
5. 19
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Sāgara megha, circumambulated the bhikṣu Sāgara megha many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back
again and again, departed from the bhikṣu Sāgara megha.
