ŚIVARĀGRA
52. 1
Sudhana eventually reached the village of Dharma and approached the
brahmin Śivarāgra. He bowed his head to the feet of the brahmin Śivarāgra,
stood before him, and, with his palms together in homage, said, “Ārya, I
have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I
do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in
what way they should practice it. Ārya, I have heard that you give
instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and how they should
practice it!”
52. 2
When he had said that, the brahmin Śivarāgra said, “Noble one, I have the
conduct empowered by truth. There is the speech of truth by which the
bodhisattvas in the three times have not turned back, do not turn back,
and will never turn back from the highest, complete enlightenment. Through
the empowerment of that speech of truth, if I say ‘May this and that
necessity be accomplished!’ then all my wishes become fulfilled.

52. 3
“Noble one, I know only this empowerment of the truth. How could I
know the conduct or describe the qualities of the bodhisattvas who have
attained the speech devoted to truth?
52. 4
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called
Sumanāmukha. There resides a boy by the name of Śrīsaṃbhava and a girl
by the name of Śrīmati. Go to them and ask them, ‘How should a bodhisattva
train in and practice bodhisattva conduct?’ ”
52. 5
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
brahmin Śivarāgra. He circumambulated the brahmin Śivarāgra many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, [F.279.a] and,
looking back at him again and again, he departed from the brahmin
Śivarāgra.
