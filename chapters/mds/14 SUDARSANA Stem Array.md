Eventually he arrived at the land of Trinayana. He searched for the bhikṣu
Sudarśana throughout the land, throughout the towns, throughout the cities,
throughout the marketplaces, throughout the villages, [F.392.b] throughout
the cattle pens, throughout the ashrams of ṛṣis, throughout the regions and
districts, throughout the banks of rivers, throughout mountain caves, and
throughout great forests until he saw the bhikṣu Sudarśana inside a thick
forest.

He was dedicated to possessing the way of the Dharma of all the
tathāgatas. He was dedicated to bringing the light of wisdom to all beings.
He was mindful of the way of the tathāgatas. He was on the meditation

kinnaras, mahoragas, Śakra, Brahmā, the world guardians, humans, and
nonhumans.
14. 6
When Sudarśana was going to change the direction in which he was
walking, the devas of the directions turned
 the field of directions around.
The devas of walking received his footsteps on precious lotuses. The devas
who cause fire, who have unceasing disks of light, dispelled obscuring
darkness. The devas of the forest of Jambudhvaja [F.393.b] sent down a rain
of many flowers. The devas of the earth, who have the essence of stability,
revealed many sources of jewels. The devas of the sky, who have the
splendor of complete brightness, adorned the surface of the sky. The devas
of the ocean, who are the source of splendor, scattered great precious jewels.
The devas of Sumeru, who have the essence of stainlessness, placed their
hands together and paid homage. The devas of the air, who have unimpeded

devas of the night,
 with their bodies bedecked in jewelry, bowed down in
homage. The devas of the daytime, who have the disk that always causes
beings to wake were holding banners of precious jewels that illuminated the
directions and standing in the sky in order to create light.

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the bhikṣu Sudarśana and
bowed his head onto the surface of the bhikṣu Sudarśana’s feet, covered the
surface of the bhikṣu Sudarśana’s feet with kisses,
 and wiped
 them
well.

14. 8
Then Sudhana sat down before the bhikṣu Sudarśana and with his hands
placed together said, “Ārya, I am set on the highest, complete enlightenment
and am seeking bodhisattva conduct.
14. 9
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
14. 10
The bhikṣu Sudarśana said, “Noble one, having reached adulthood, I am
newly entered into the homeless life. [F.394.a]
14. 11
“Noble one, I have in this one lifetime practiced celibacy before as many
tathāgatas as there are grains of sand
 in thirty-eight Ganges Rivers. I
practiced celibacy with some for a day and night. I practiced celibacy with
some for seven days. I practiced celibacy with some for half a month. I
practiced celibacy with some for a month. I practiced celibacy with some for a
year. I practiced celibacy with some for a hundred years. I practiced celibacy
with some for a thousand years. I practiced celibacy with some for a hundred
thousand years. I practiced celibacy with some for ten million years. I
practiced celibacy with some for a quintillion years. I practiced celibacy with
some for an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of years. I practiced celibacy with
some for an intermediate kalpa. I practiced celibacy with some for half a

“I have purified an array of prayers. I have purified the field of conduct
that enters the range of realization.787
“I have completed an ocean of the perfections. I have perceived the
miraculous manifestations of complete buddhahood. I have held their
wheels of Dharma each distinct from another.
14. 13
“I have realized the equality of their strengths. I have held their teachings
for as long as their Dharma remained.
“I have accomplished, through the power of the accomplishment of the
samādhi of the field of prayer, the previous prayers of all those tathāgatas for
the purification of my own buddha realm. [F.394.b]

14. 14
“I have accomplished, through the power of entering the samādhi of
entering all conducts, the past practice of bodhisattva conduct by all those
tathāgatas for the purification of my own conduct.
“I have accomplished, through the power of setting forth on completely
good conduct, the pure perfections of all those tathāgatas.
14. 15
“Moreover, noble one, because of the gateway of the perfectly observant
wisdom, while I am walking on this meditation walkway there come toward
me the gateways of the continuums of all directions.
14. 16
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, the gateways of the
continuums of all world realms are moving further away in order to purify
the transcendence of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of world realms
through the power of accomplishing great prayers.
14. 17
“In one instant of mind, through the power of accomplishing the
bodhisattva’s completely good conduct and prayers, I directly perceive an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of gateways of the ways of conduct among
beings in order to complete the wisdoms of the ten strengths.
14. 18
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of
accomplishing the prayers to make offerings to past and future buddhas, I
directly perceive the vision of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of buddha
realms
 in order to make offerings to, serve, and honor tathāgatas as
numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of buddha realms.
[F.395.a]
788
14. 19
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, there falls rain from the clouds
of Dharma of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of tathāgatas through the
power of accomplishing the prayers for
 the mental retention of holding
the Dharma wheels that
 follow countless ways of the Dharma.
789
790
14. 20
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayers to fulfill the bodhisattva conduct that are like
magical illusions,
 I directly perceive the ocean of the conduct of an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of bodhisattvas in order to purify all fields of
conduct.
791
14. 21
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayer to concentrate all the fields of samādhi
through a single samādhi, I directly perceive the ocean of an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of samādhis in order to purify all fields of
samādhi.
14. 22
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayer to attain the power of the highest
mindfulness, I directly perceive the ocean of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta
of powers in order to manifest all the wheels of the powers and the wheels of
time.

14. 23
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayer for the end of endless beings, I directly
perceive an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of wheels of time in order to turn
the wheels of Dharma in all times.
14. 24
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayer for the light of the wisdom of realization, I
directly perceive an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of oceans of all three
times in order to establish the three times in all world realms in a single
time.
 [F.395.b]

14. 25
“However, noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the
never-extinguished lamp of wisdom.
 How could I know or describe the
qualities of the bodhisattvas whose aspiration is like a vajra; who have been
born into the family that is the family of all the tathāgatas; who have the
power of unceasing life; who have a lamp of wisdom that is never
extinguished; who have indestructible, unbreakable bodies; who have
accomplished a physical form that is like an illusion; who have bodies that
have the limbs and smaller physical parts that accord with being phenomena
dependent on causes; who have bodies that are perceived in accordance
with the wishes of beings; who demonstrate forms, bodies, colors, shapes,
and circumferences that are like those of all beings; who have bodies that are
unharmed by burning embers, flames, poison, or weapons; whose bodies are
as hard as vajras and as invincible
 as the Cakravāla mountain range; who
make the power of all māras and adversaries ineffective; who resemble a
mountain of Jambu River gold; who have bodies that are superior to those of
all beings; who are perceived as a refuge
 by all beings; who are perceived
and heard from all sides; who are looked up to with admiration by
 all
beings; who are the source of the clouds of all the Dharma; who illuminate
every direction; who appear beautiful as a result of destroying the
mountains of obscurations; who appear as supreme heroes because they
defeat all the roots of demerit; who are a joy to see because they originate
from vast roots of merit; and who are as rare as fig flowers?”

“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a city called Sumukha
in the land called Śramaṇa maṇḍala. [F.396.a]
“There dwells a boy by the name of Indriyeśvara. Go to him and ask him,
‘How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
14. 27
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was dedicated to the pure prowess
and practice of the bodhisattvas. His mind was illuminated by the light of the
power of the bodhisattvas. In his heart he had mastered the unconquerable
fortitude of the bodhisattvas. His mind was indefatigable because of the
excellent armor of the resolution of the bodhisattvas. He was dedicated to

the stability and vastness of the resolute aspiration of the bodhisattvas. He
had the aspiration to possess all the rain from the clouds of bodhisattva
conduct. He had the continuity of never having enough of the rain from the
clouds of Dharma of the bodhisattvas. He had the aspiration directed toward
realizing all the qualities of the bodhisattvas. He longed to send himself to
be the embodiment of the charioteers for all beings. He longed to lead beings
out beyond the great forest of saṃsāra. He never had enough of gazing
upon, listening to, and honoring kalyāṇamitras. He had developed an
immeasurable veneration for the Dharma.
14. 28
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Sudarśana, circumambulated the bhikṣu Sudarśana many hundreds
of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from the presence of the bhikṣu Sudarśana. [B1] [V38] [F.1.b]
