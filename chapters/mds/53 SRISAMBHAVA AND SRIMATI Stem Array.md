Chapter 53
ŚRĪSAṂBHAVA AND ŚRĪMATI
53. 1
Sudhana eventually reached the town of Sumanāmukha and approached the
boy Śrīsaṃbhava and the girl Śrīmati. He bowed his head to their feet, stood
before them with his palms together in homage, and said, “Āryas, I have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do
not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what
way they should practice it. Āryas, I have heard that you give instruction
and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and how they should
practice it!”
53. 2
The boy Śrīsaṃbhava and the girl Śrīmati said to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, “Noble one, we have both attained and manifested the
bodhisattva liberation called the appearance of illusion.
53. 3
“Noble one, through possessing this liberation, we see all worlds as the
appearance of illusions arising from illusory causes and conditions.
53. 4
“We know karma and kleśas to be illusions, and so we know all beings to
be the appearance of illusions.
53. 5
“We see that all beings
 are the appearance of illusions because they
arise from illusory
 ignorance, becoming, and craving.
1942
1943
53. 6
“We see that all phenomena
 are the appearance of illusions because
they arise from illusory
 interdependent conditions.
1944
1945
53. 7
“We see that all three realms also are the appearance of illusions because
they arise from erroneous illusions.1946
53. 8
“We see the passing away and transference, conception, birth, old age and
death, misery, wailing, suffering, unhappiness, and agitation of all beings as
the appearance of illusions because they arise from the illusion
 of
incorrect thoughts. [F.279.b]
1947


---

53. 9
“We see all realms also as illusions because they arise from being
bewildered by conceptions of nonexistence because of the illusions
 of
erroneous conceptions, motivations, and views.
1948
53. 10
“We see all śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas as the appearance of illusion
because they arise from illusory
 analysis that has discarded wisdom.
1949
53. 11
“We also know the successive ripening and guiding of beings through
bodhisattva conduct and prayers to be like the appearance of illusions
because they are accomplished as illusions having emanated conduct and
guidance that have the nature of being illusions.
53. 12
“We see the field of buddhas and bodhisattvas as the appearance of
illusions, because it is accomplished through the illusion of prayers and
wisdom and has the nature of being an illusory inconceivable range of
perception.
53. 13
“Noble one, the two of us know only this bodhisattva liberation called the
appearance of illusion. How could we know the conduct or describe the
qualities of the bodhisattvas who have realized the net of the
accomplishment of infinite illusory activities?”
53. 14
Then the boy Śrīsaṃbhava and the girl Śrīmati, through having saturated
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, with inconceivable, powerful roots of
merit, and having taught him their own liberation, said, “Depart, noble one.
In this southern region there is a great park called Mahāvyūha in a province
called Samudrakaccha. Within it there is a great kūṭāgāra called Vairocana-
vyūhālaṃkāra garbha, which has been created by the ripening of a
bodhisattva’s roots of merit. [F.280.a] It has appeared from the mind and
mentation of a bodhisattva. It has arisen from the prayers of a bodhisattva. It
has appeared from the power of a bodhisattva. It has been emanated by the
power of the higher knowledge of a bodhisattva. It has appeared from the
skillful methods of a bodhisattva. It has been perfected by the strength of the
merit and knowledge of a bodhisattva. It has manifested for the guiding of
beings by the great compassion of a bodhisattva. It has been accomplished
by the display of the blessing of a bodhisattva. It is adorned by dwelling in
the inconceivable state of bodhisattva liberation. Within it resides the
bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, in order to take into his care the humans
who dwell on the level of birth; in order to ripen fathers, mothers, and
families; in order to make firm
 the Mahāyāna for bodhisattvas born there
who have the corresponding conduct;
 in order to also ripen other beings
with roots of merit according to their levels; in order to teach how to enter
his own liberation; in order to describe how bodhisattvas with power over
birth go everywhere intent on manifesting in the births of all beings in order
not to forsake ripening beings; in order to generate the strength of the great
compassion of a bodhisattva through not being inferior in caring for all
1950
1951


---

beings; in order for bodhisattvas to realize rising up above all locations; and
in order for them to manifest, without location, being located in all births in
existences.
53. 15
“Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva inquire about
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva purify the bodhisattva
path? [F.280.b]
 How should a bodhisattva practice the bodhisattva
training? How should a bodhisattva purify the aspiration to enlightenment?
How should a bodhisattva accomplish bodhisattva prayers? How should a
bodhisattva gather the bodhisattva accumulations? How should a
bodhisattva ascend the bodhisattva bhūmis? How should a bodhisattva
complete the bodhisattva perfections? How should a bodhisattva enter the
patience of a bodhisattva? How should a bodhisattva dwell in the qualities
of bodhisattva practice? How should a bodhisattva serve the kalyāṇamitras?’
1952
53. 16
“Why should you do that? Noble one, the bodhisattva Maitreya has
understood all bodhisattva conduct, he has comprehended the minds and
thoughts of all beings, he has followed the conduct of all beings, he is
focused on ripening and guiding all beings, he has completed all the
perfections, he dwells on all the bodhisattva bhūmis, he has attained all the
patience of a bodhisattva, he is free of the defects of a bodhisattva, he
possesses all the prophecies of a bodhisattva, he delights in all the
liberations of a bodhisattva, he has acquired all the blessings of the buddhas,
and he has been empowered by the empowerment of the range of
omniscience of all the tathāgatas. [F.281.a]
53. 17
“Noble one, that kalyāṇamitra will saturate you with roots of merit, he will
increase your aspiration for enlightenment, he will make the element of your
superior aspiration stable, he will purify all your roots of merit, he will
increase the force of your bodhisattva powers, he will reveal the unobscured
direction of the Dharma, he will make you realize the understanding of all
the bhūmis that are entered, he will make you enter the gateways to the
arising of the prayers of all bodhisattvas, and he will show you the gateway
to the arising of the attainment of the completely good bodhisattva conduct.
53. 18
“Noble one, do not be attached to one root of merit! Do not be devoted to
one illumination from the light of a Dharma gateway! Do not be dedicated to
accomplishing one prayer! Do not continuously follow through one
prophecy! Do not have the perception that three kinds of patience are
enough! Do not continually bring to completion six perfections! Do not make
attaining ten bhūmis the ultimate goal! Do not aspire to possess and purify a
measurable number of buddha realms! Do not be satisfied by rejoicing in and
serving a measurable extent of kalyāṇamitras!


---

53. 19
“Why is that? Noble one, a bodhisattva must gather countless roots of
merit; [F.281.b] must accomplish countless bodhisattva accumulations; must
gather countless causes of bodhisattva motivation; must train in countless
ways of dedication;
 must ripen countless realms of beings; must

clouds of the Dharma and must expand the vast extent, without end or
middle, of bodhisattva conduct. A bodhisattva
 must complete all the
perfections; a bodhisattva
 must acquire countless prophecies; a
bodhisattva must enter an incalculable number of gateways into patience; a
bodhisattva must purify innumerable bhūmis; a bodhisattva must make pure
a countless number of gateways to the Dharma; a bodhisattva must purify an

“Noble one, in brief, bodhisattva conduct manifests equally to all beings
because it ripens all beings; [F.283.b]
 it manifests equally in all kalpas
because it remains throughout all kalpas; it manifests equally in all births
because it manifests births everywhere; it manifests equally in all times
because of the realization of the knowledge of the three times; it manifests
equally in all Dharmas because it is the practice of all Dharmas; it manifests
equally in all realms because it purifies all realms; it manifests equally in all
prayers because it fulfills all prayers; it manifests equally to all buddhas
because it is the accomplishment of making offerings to all buddhas; it
1958

manifests equally in all bodhisattvas because it is the one prayer of all
bodhisattvas; and it manifests equally to all kalyāṇamitras because it serves
all kalyāṇamitras.
53. 21
“Therefore, noble one, never weary of seeking for kalyāṇamitras! Never
feel you have had enough of seeing kalyāṇamitras! Never feel you no longer
need to ask questions of kalyāṇamitras! Never turn your thoughts away
from being with kalyāṇamitras! Never cease from revering and venerating
kalyāṇamitras! Never maintain the instructions and teachings of the
kalyāṇamitras incorrectly! Never have doubts concerning the attainment of
the qualities of the kalyāṇamitras! Never have uncertainty concerning the
teaching of gateways that have been brought forth by the kalyāṇamitras!
Never have anger toward the following of worldly ways through the use of
methods by kalyāṇamitras! [F.284.a] Never let your mind and body deviate
from the development of adoration for the kalyāṇamitras!
53. 22
“Why is that? Noble one, hearing of all the bodhisattva conducts of
bodhisattvas is dependent on the kalyāṇamitras. All the completion of the
qualities of a bodhisattva comes from the kalyāṇamitras. All the continuation
of bodhisattva prayers comes from the kalyāṇamitras. All the roots of merit of
a bodhisattva are created by the kalyāṇamitras. All the accumulations of a
bodhisattva are accomplished by the kalyāṇamitras. All the lights from the
Dharma doors of the bodhisattvas come from the kalyāṇamitras. All the pure
doors of the setting-forth of bodhisattvas
 come from the kalyāṇamitras.
All the practices of bodhisattva training are dependent on the kalyāṇamitras.
All the phenomena of the qualities of bodhisattvas rely on the kalyāṇamitras.
All the pure higher motivations of bodhisattvas have the kalyāṇamitras as
their roots. All the firm developments of the aspiration to enlightenment of
the bodhisattvas arise from the kalyāṇamitras. The kalyāṇamitras are the
guides to all the light from the doors to
 the mental retention and
eloquence of bodhisattvas. The kalyāṇamitras possess all the treasures of the
doors to the purity of the bodhisattvas. The kalyāṇamitras give rise to all the
light of the knowledge of the bodhisattvas. The kalyāṇamitras hold in their
hands all the special prayers of the bodhisattvas. The single family of the
way of the prayers of bodhisattvas is dependent on the kalyāṇamitras.
[F.284.b] The equality of all the special accomplishments
 of the
bodhisattvas comes from the family of the kalyāṇamitras. All the secret states
of the bodhisattvas are in the treasury of the kalyāṇamitras. All the
qualities
 of the bodhisattvas originate in the kalyāṇamitras. All the
seedlings of the force of the power of bodhisattvas are increased by the
kalyāṇamitras. All the oceans of wisdom of the bodhisattvas are increased by
the kalyāṇamitras. All the treasuries of the wealth of the bodhisattvas are
protected by the kalyāṇamitras. All the accumulations of merit of the

bodhisattvas are guarded by the kalyāṇamitras. All the pure lifetimes of the
bodhisattvas are created by the kalyāṇamitras. All the clouds of Dharma
heard by the bodhisattvas come from the mouths of the kalyāṇamitras. All
the paths of setting forth entered by the bodhisattvas are within the
kalyāṇamitras. All the enlightenments of the buddhas are attained through
venerating the kalyāṇamitras. All the conducts of the bodhisattvas are
possessed by the kalyāṇamitras. All the descriptions of the qualities of
bodhisattvas are taught by the kalyāṇamitras. All following the direction of
the Dharma by bodhisattvas is taught by the kalyāṇamitras. All the greatness
of the aspirations and superior motivations of bodhisattvas is described by
the kalyāṇamitras. All the strength of the great love of the bodhisattvas
comes from the kalyāṇamitras. [F.285.a] All the strength of the great
compassion of the bodhisattvas is created by the kalyāṇamitras. All the
powers of the bodhisattvas are possessed by the kalyāṇamitras. All the
aspects
 of the bodhisattvas are created by the kalyāṇamitras. All the
benefits accomplished by the bodhisattvas come from the kalyāṇamitras.
1963
53. 23
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas cared for by the kalyāṇamitras do not fall
into the lower existences. The bodhisattvas in the care of the kalyāṇamitras
do not turn away from the Mahāyāna. The bodhisattvas who are in the
thoughts of the kalyāṇamitras do not transgress the trainings. The
bodhisattvas guarded by kalyāṇamitras do not fall into the hands of bad
companions. The bodhisattvas protected by kalyāṇamitras do not lapse from
the Dharma of the bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas being cared for by
kalyāṇamitras transcend the level of ordinary beings. The bodhisattvas
guarded by kalyāṇamitras do not engage in the faults of the śrāvakas and
pratyeka buddhas.
 The bodhisattvas protected by kalyāṇamitras rise
above the world. The bodhisattvas created by kalyāṇamitras are unstained
by worldly qualities. The bodhisattvas who serve the kalyāṇamitras practice
a conduct free of confusion. [F.285.b] The bodhisattvas accomplished by
kalyāṇamitras do not turn away from all undertakings. The bodhisattvas in
the care of kalyāṇamitras are invincible to karma and kleśas. The
bodhisattvas who are reliant on the strength of the kalyāṇamitras are
invulnerable to all māras. The bodhisattvas who remain dependent on
kalyāṇamitras increase all the aspects of enlightenment.
1964
53. 24
“Why is that? Noble one, the kalyāṇamitras have purified all obscured
qualities. The kalyāṇamitras have turned away from bad actions. The
kalyāṇamitras have understood what is not to be done. They have eliminated
all states of carelessness. They have dispelled the darkness of ignorance.
They have cut through the bondage of wrong views. They have left the city
of saṃsāra. They have discarded worldly states. They have become free from
the noose of Māra. They have pulled out the splinter of suffering. They have


---

been liberated from the wasteland of unknowing. They have eliminated the
misery of wrong views. They are freed from the river of existence. They are
extracted from the swamp of desire. They have turned away from paths to
unhappiness. They teach the path of the bodhisattvas. They maintain the
resolve of the bodhisattva. They establish others in practice. They teach the
direction for going to omniscience. They purify the eyes of wisdom. They
increase the aspiration to enlightenment. They give rise to great compassion.
They teach the conduct. They teach the instructions for the perfections. They
establish others on the bhūmis. They elucidate
 patience. [F.286.a] They
cause the accomplishment of all roots of merit. They cause the development
of all accumulations. They bestow all the bodhisattva qualities. They enable
going to the feet of all buddhas. They teach all qualities. They bring the
acquisition of all benefits. They inspire practice. They reveal the door to
setting forth. They guard others from taking wrong paths. They bring
illumination from the gateways to the light of the Dharma. They bring
saturation from the doors of the Dharma. They send down a rain from clouds
of hearing the Dharma. They cause all kleśas to cease. They turn others away
from all wrong views. They establish others in all the Dharmas of the
buddhas.
1965
53. 25
“Noble one, in that way, the kalyāṇamitras are like mothers because they
give birth to the family of the buddhas. The kalyāṇamitras are like fathers
because they accomplish great benefits. The kalyāṇamitras are like nannies
because they guard from all bad actions. The kalyāṇamitras are like teachers
because 
they 
bring 
understanding 
of 
bodhisattva 
training. 
The
kalyāṇamitras are like guides because they bring others onto the bodhisattva
path. The kalyāṇamitras are like doctors because they free others from the
illness of the kleśas. The kalyāṇamitras are like the Himalayas because they
multiply the medicinal herbs of wisdom. The kalyāṇamitras are like heroes
because they guard from all fears. The kalyāṇamitras are like ferry captain
because they bring others across the great river of saṃsāra. The
kalyāṇamitras are like sea captains because they take others to the island of
the jewels of omniscient wisdom.
53. 26
“Noble one, you should approach the kalyāṇamitras continuously,
thinking in this way: [F.286.b] You should approach the kalyāṇamitras with a
mind like the earth for carrying all burdens without weariness, with a mind
like a vajra because it is indestructible, with a mind like the Cakravāla
mountain range because it is unaffected by any suffering, with a mind like a
slave because it gladly obeys, with a mind like a pupil because it does not
disobey instructions, with a mind like a slave of the world because it takes
on all tasks without resentment, with a mind like a nanny because it is
unwearied by any kleśa, with a mind like a servant because it is prepared to

do any kind of work, with a mind like a street sweeper because it is devoid of
pride and arrogance, with a mind like a full moon because it is lofty at the
appropriate time and low at the inappropriate time, with a mind like a
thoroughbred stallion because it is devoid of unruliness, with a mind like a
carriage because it can carry a heavy load, with a mind like an elephant
because it is tamed and well bred, with a mind like a mountain because it is
immovable and unshakable, with a mind like a dog because it is not angered,
with a mind like a caṇḍāla because it is without pride or egoism,
 with a
mind like a hornless bull because it is without arrogance, with a mind like an
in-house pupil
 because it has no haughtiness, with a mind like a boat
because it is unwearied by coming and going, with a mind like a bridge
because it reaches the conclusion of the kalyāṇamitra’s instruction, with a
mind like an excellent son
 because it looks up at the face of the
kalyāṇamitra, and with a mind like a prince because it does not disobey the
king of the Dharma.

kalyāṇamitra as a guide, think of the instructions as the path, and think of

53. 35
“Noble one, you should think of yourself as a good son, [F.287.b] think of
the kalyāṇamitra as your parents, think of the instructions as the behavior of
someone from a good family, and think of their practice as keeping to that
good behavior.
53. 36
“Noble one, you should think of yourself as a prince, think of the
kalyāṇamitra as a Dharma king and the prime minister, think of the
instructions as the king’s law, and think of their practice as looking at the
crown and adornments of the king of wisdom, the turban of the Dharma
bound upon his head, and the Dharma king’s city.
53. 37
“Noble one, you should approach the kalyāṇamitras meditating on those
thoughts and perceptions of the kalyāṇamitras.
53. 38
“Why is that? Noble one, it is because when a bodhisattva, who has a pure
superior motivation toward the kalyāṇamitras, is practicing all the
instructions of the kalyāṇamitras, all the bodhisattva’s roots of merit will
increase like the grass, bushes, herbs, and forests that depend on the
Himalayas. The bodhisattva becomes a container of all Dharmas just as the
great ocean is a container of water. The bodhisattva becomes the source of
many qualities just as the great ocean is a source of many jewels. The
bodhisattva purifies just as the heat of fire purifies gold. The bodhisattva is
higher than the world just as Sumeru is higher than the ocean. The
bodhisattva is unstained by the worldly qualities just as water does not cling
to lotuses. The bodhisattva does not keep company with bad behavior just as
the ocean does not keep a corpse. The bodhisattva increases good qualities
just like the phase of the waxing moon. The bodhisattva illuminates the
realm of the Dharma just as the sun illuminates the world. [F.288.a] The
bodhisattva has bodies that are all born from prayer just as a son is
associated with his parents.
53. 39
“In brief, noble one, the bodhisattvas who follow thus the instructions of
the kalyāṇamitras possess uncountable millions of quintillions of qualities.
They purify millions of quintillions of higher motivations. They increase
millions of quintillions of bodhisattva powers. They purify
 millions of
quintillions of empowerments. They purify away millions of quintillions of
obscurations. They transcend millions of quintillions of māras. They enter
millions of quintillions of Dharma gateways. They complete millions of
quintillions of accumulations. They purify millions of quintillions of
conducts. They accomplish millions of quintillions of great prayers.
1970
53. 40
“Thus, noble one, in brief, all bodhisattva conduct, all bodhisattva
perfections, all bodhisattva bhūmis, all bodhisattva entries into patience, all
bodhisattva gateways to samādhi, all bodhisattva miraculous manifestations
through the wisdom of higher cognition, all the bodhisattva illumination
through mental retention and eloquence, all limitless ripened
 wisdom

and higher cognition, [F.288.b] all the accomplishment of bodhisattva
prayers, and all attainment and accomplishment of buddha qualities depend
on the kalyāṇamitras, have the kalyāṇamitras as their root, come from the
kalyāṇamitras, have the kalyāṇamitras as their source, have the
kalyāṇamitras as their origin,
 are born from the kalyāṇamitras, are
increased by the kalyāṇamitras, are based on the kalyāṇamitras, have the
kalyāṇamitras as their cause, and arise from the kalyāṇamitras.”

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having listened to the teaching that
praised the qualities of the kalyāṇamitras, having listened to limitless
bodhisattva conduct and the vast qualities of the buddhas, was filled with
joy, delighted, elated, pleased, and happy, and he bowed his head to the feet
of the boy Śrīsaṃbhava and the girl Śrīmati. He circumambulated the boy
Śrīsaṃbhava and the girl Śrīmati many hundreds of thousands of times,
keeping them to his right, and, looking back at them again and again, he
departed from the boy Śrīsaṃbhava and the girl Śrīmati. [B18]
