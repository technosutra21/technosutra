Chapter 55
MAÑJUŚRĪ
55. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, after passing through a hundred and ten
towns, came to the district called Sumanāmukha, where, while thinking of
and looking for Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, he was aspiring and praying to see
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta and continually yearning to meet him.
55. 2
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, from a distance of a hundred and ten
yojanas, extended his hand and placed it upon the head of Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, who was in the town of Sumanāmukha, and said,
“Well done, well done, noble one! Someone who does not have the power of
faith, who has a mind that wearies, who has thoughts of despondency, who
abandons practice, who turns away from diligence, who is pleased by
having a few qualities, who remains clinging to a single root of merit, who is
not skilled in accomplishing the conduct and prayer, who is not in the care of
a kalyāṇamitra, and who does not consider the buddhas is unable to know
the true nature of phenomena in this way, or to know this kind of way and
this kind of range of activity, or to know this kind of place or enter it, or to
believe in it or examine it or understand it or attain it.”
55. 3
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta taught Sudhana by speaking of the Dharma
and, having inspired him, extolled him, and gladdened him, made him the
possessor of countless Dharma gateways, so that he attained the great
illumination of infinite wisdom. He blessed him with a bodhisattva’s
retention, eloquence, samādhi, higher cognitions, and infinite wisdom and
established him in the field of completely good conduct, and he remained in
his own region and departed from the presence of Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son. [F.345.a] [B22]
