Chapter 21
MAHĀPRABHA
21. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembered that illusion of wisdom. He
contemplated the bodhisattva’s liberation that had the form of illusion. He
examined the illusory aspect of the nature of phenomena. He comprehended
the equality of the illusions of actions. He reflected on the equality of the
illusions of phenomena. He comprehended the equality of the emanations
that are ripened by the Dharma. He followed the inconceivable appearances
that arise from wisdom. He accomplished the accomplishment of the
illusions of infinite prayer. He purified the unimpeded conduct that has the
true nature of an illusory manifestation. He analyzed the three times as
having the characteristics of being composed of illusions.
21. 2
In one land after another, he questioned, searched, and looked around,
seeking without weariness of the mind or exhaustion of the body
throughout all the main and intermediate directions, roads, [F.27.b] valleys,
and plains, even and uneven ground, wet lands and dry lands, mountains
and caves, villages and towns, markets, lands, kingdoms, and capitals. He
reached the vicinity of the city of Suprabha and asked, “Where is King
Mahāprabha?”
Many people told him, “Noble one, that over there is the city named
Suprabha. King Mahāprabha lives there.”
21. 3
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the city of Suprabha
and saw the great city of Suprabha. Seeing it, he was overjoyed, pleased,
content, and happy. He thought, “I am looking at the place where my
kalyāṇamitra lives. Today I will see the kalyāṇamitra. I will hear from him the
bodhisattva conduct, and I will hear from him the inconceivable
gateways through which the bodhisattva sets forth, the inconceivable true
nature of a bodhisattva, the inconceivable qualities of a bodhisattva, the
inconceivable range of activity of a bodhisattva, the inconceivable powerful
1017


---

supremacy of a bodhisattva, the inconceivable samādhis practiced by a
bodhisattva, the inconceivable liberations enjoyed by a bodhisattva, and the
inconceivable pure fulfillment of the undertakings of a bodhisattva.”
21. 4
Concentrating on those thoughts, Sudhana approached the city of
Suprabha, and having arrived he looked at the city of Suprabha. It was
encircled by seven wonderful and beautiful moats that were trenches of the
seven precious materials —gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red pearls, emeralds,
and white coral —filled with water, with a layer of gold sand at their bottoms,
[F.28.a] their surfaces covered with divine blue lotuses, red lotuses, night
lotuses, and white lotuses and the water made turbid with
 yellow
sandalwood mud. It was encircled by seven rows of palm trees made of the
seven precious materials. It was encircled by seven walls made of diamonds:
these were a wall of lovely lion diamonds, a wall of undefeatable diamonds, a
wall of powerfully penetrative diamonds, a wall of invincible diamonds, a
strong wall of unimpedable, resolute diamonds, a wall that contained a
network of the light rays of diamonds, and a wall of the array of the
immaculate colors of diamonds. All those great
 walls of precious
diamonds were studded with countless precious jewels. They were adorned
with shining railings of Jambu River gold on which were strung strings of
ivory beads, shining railings of silver jewels on which were strung strings of
ivory beads, shining railings of beryl jewels on which were strung strings of
ivory beads, shining railings of crystal jewels on which were strung strings
of ivory beads, shining railings of coral jewels on which were strung strings
of ivory beads, shining railings of red pearls on which were strung strings of
ivory beads, and shining railings of pearl jewels, the essence of the oceans,
on which were strung strings of ivory beads.
1018
1019
21. 5
The distance between each of the eight great gateways of the city was ten
yojanas. The gates were multicolored, beautifully made of the seven precious
materials.
21. 6
That great city was vast, huge, and divided into eight districts. The ground
was made of blue beryl. There were a hundred million streets in that city, and
on both sides of each street there were a hundred thousand well-built and
arranged mansions in which many hundreds of billions of beings lived. All
those houses were made of the seven precious materials, were adorned with
an array of various jewels, [F.28.b] had precious parasols and banners
erected upon them, and were endowed with all requisites.
21. 7
That great city was beautified by high buildings that had the countless
colors of precious jewels: There were countless kūṭāgāras of Jambu River
gold, with an inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of strings
of beryl jewels. There were countless kūṭāgāras of silver, with an
inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of strings of red pearls.


---

There were countless kūṭāgāras of beryl, with an inconceivable array of
jewels, covered in a network of strings of a treasure of precious jewels. There
were countless kūṭāgāras of crystal, with an inconceivable array of jewels,
covered in a network of strings of the kings of jewels called abundant essence.
There were countless kūṭāgāras of jewels that delight beings, with an
inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of strings of the kings of
jewels called sunstones. There were countless kūṭāgāras of sapphires, with
an inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of strings of the kings
of jewels called light rays of splendor jewels. There were countless kūṭāgāras of
the precious jewel ocean of beings, with an inconceivable array of jewels,
covered in a network of strings of the kings of jewels called asterias.
There were countless kūṭāgāras of diamonds, with an inconceivable array of
jewels, covered in a network of strings of the kings of jewels called invincible
banners.
 There were countless kūṭāgāras of yellow sandalwood, with an
inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network
 of divine coral tree
flowers. [F.29.a] There were countless kūṭāgāras of the unequaled king of
perfumes, with an inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of a
variety of divine flowers.
1020
1021
1022
21. 8
Each of those precious houses was adorned with many precious rooftop
railings,
 was encircled by seven levels of precious balconies,
 and had
seven rows of precious palm trees arranged around it. Precious strings
connected all the precious rooftop railings and the precious palm trees. Lines
of golden bells adorned all those precious strings. Hanging wreaths of
flowers were fastened to all those golden bells, and a network of precious
little spherical bells hung from all those wreaths of flowers.
1023
1024
21. 9
In that way, the entire great city was covered in countless networks of
precious jewels, was covered in countless networks of precious bells and
little spherical bells, was covered in countless networks of divine perfumes,
was covered in countless networks of divine flowers, was covered in
countless networks of precious spheres, was covered in countless diamond
canopies, was covered in countless precious canopies, was covered in
countless precious parasols, was covered in countless precious kūṭāgāra
canopies, was covered in countless precious cloth canopies, and was
covered in countless canopies of flower garlands. Precious parasols and
banners had been erected throughout the great city.
21. 10
In the center of the great city of Suprabha was King Mahāprabha’s palace.
[F.29.b] The palace was four yojanas wide on every side, was made of the
seven precious materials, was encircled by seven levels of balconies, had
seven levels of networks of precious little spherical bells that emitted a


---

beautiful sound, was encircled by seven rows of palm trees made of the
seven precious materials, and was adorned by an inconceivable hundred
thousand kūṭāgāras made of various precious materials.
21. 11
It had pools made of a variety of precious materials, with bottoms covered
in gold sand, filled with water that had the eight excellent qualities, and its
surface was covered with blue lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses.
They were beautified by trees that had flowers and fruits of every kind of
precious material. On all four sides there were beautiful precious railings
intersected by steps. There were the divine, sweet, and melodious songs of
flocks of birds.
21. 12
In the center of this palace, which rivaled that of Devendra,
 there was a
precious kūṭāgāra that shone on beings. It was adorned with a splendid
display of countless, beautiful jewels. It was a treasury of the good Dharma
that had been established by King Mahāprabha.
1025
21. 13
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had no attachment toward the
precious moats, he was not astonished by the precious walls, he had no
craving for the rows of precious palm trees, he took no delight in the sounds
from the networks of bells and little spherical bells, he had no clinging to the
melodious sounds of the divine music and songs, he paid no attention to the
delights of the celestial kūṭāgāras composed of various shining jewels, he
found no pleasure in the pleasurable qualities of the groups of young men
and women, and he was detached from the pleasures of form, sound, smell,
taste, and touch. [F.30.a]
21. 14
Focused on the contemplation of the Dharma, he asked whomever he met
about the kalyāṇamitra. In that way, he eventually arrived at a place in the
city where three roads met, and he looked around. He saw that not far from a
caitya temple in the center of the junction of the three roads was a great
throne with great adornments. It had legs of blue beryl, was supported by
white beryl lions, was inlaid with a network of threads of Jambu River gold,
and had various precious cushions, superior to divine materials, laid upon it.
It was adorned by countless precious disks and covered with an
inconceivable network of an array of precious jewels. Above it there was a
canopy like a tent made of cloth of Jambu River gold, with a variety of divine
precious materials and a central lotus made of the kings of wish-fulfilling
jewels.
21. 15
Seated cross-legged on that great Dharma throne was King Mahāprabha,
whose body was adorned by the thirty-two signs of a great being. His body
was beautified by the complete variety of the eighty features of a great being.
He was like a mountain of gold. He was adorned with an array of various
jewels. He shone magnificently like the disk of the sun. He was lovely to
look at like the disk of the full moon. He was beautiful like Brahmā in the


---

midst of his retinue of Brahmā devas. He was like the ocean, possessing an
accumulation of the jewels of the infinite qualities of the Dharma. Like a
great cloud he emitted the thunder that was the nature of the Dharma. Like
the sky he was adorned by the stars of the ways of the Dharma. Like Sumeru
his image appeared in the minds of the ocean of the four classes of beings.
Like an island of jewels he was a ground filled with the jewels of various
knowledges.
21. 16
Sudhana saw that arranged in front of King Mahāprabha there was a
precious heap of gold, jewels, pearls, beryls, conch, crystal, corals, gold
ornaments, and silver; a heap of divine clothing in various colors; [F.30.b] a
heap of various kinds of divine jewelry; a heap of food and various gifts; a
heap of the various kinds of superior, supremely delicious flavors; and a
heap of a range of all kinds of displays.
21. 17
Sudhana saw many trillions of precious divine carriages, many trillions of
precious divine musical instruments, many trillions of different kinds of
divine perfumes, many heaps of medicine for healing sickness, and heaps of
all kinds of particular utensils that were suitable, faultless, and for beings to
use as they wish.
21. 18
Sudhana saw a hundred thousand young milk-yielding cows with golden
horns and hooves set out for poor people to obtain.
21. 19
Sudhana saw a quintillion precious maidens who had been assembled.
They were beautiful, attractive, and lovely to look at. They were adorned in
all jewelry and wore precious clothing of divine material, their bodies
anointed with divine uragasāra sandalwood. They had mastered the sixty-
four skills and were expert in all the arts of lovemaking.
21. 20
Sudhana saw all these requisites gathered and arranged in front of the
king for beings to collect, for beings to take, to bring happiness to beings, to
bring joy to beings, to bring peace of mind to beings, to bring delight to
beings, to cause the kleśas to cease within beings, to lead beings to the
meaning of the nature of all phenomena, to direct beings to the meaning that
is the same as omniscience, to turn beings away from ill will toward others,
to turn beings away from bad physical and vocal actions, to extract the
splinter of false views from beings, and for beings to purify their path of
action.
 They were piled up and presented on two hundred million
platforms at every crossroads of four streets, at every junction of three
streets, and in front of the rows of doors and courtyards [F.31.a] on both
sides of every street.
1026
21. 21
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, prostrated his whole body onto the
ground in homage to King Mahāprabha, and he circumambulated King
Mahāprabha, keeping him to his right, many hundreds of thousands of
times. He then sat down before him, placed the palms of his hands together,


---

and said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
21. 22
“Ārya, I have heard that you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas.
Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct
and in what way they practice it!”
21. 23
King Mahāprabha said, “Noble one, I have purified and perfected the
bodhisattva conduct called the banner of great love.
21. 24
“Noble one, I addressed questions about this bodhisattva conduct called
the banner of great love to many hundreds of buddhas, many thousands of
buddhas, many hundreds of thousands of buddhas, many quintillions of
buddhas, and so on up to an innumerable number of innumerable numbers
of buddha bhagavats. From them I received it, purified it, completely purified
it,
 established it, viewed it, analyzed it, followed it,
 sought it,
examined it, wrote it out,
 and promulgated it.
1027
1028
1029
21. 25
“Noble one, in that way I have remained in this bodhisattva conduct called
the banner of great love, and I rule
 the kingdom in accord with the Dharma, I
take care of the world in accord with the Dharma, I carry out conduct in the
world in accord with the Dharma, I cause beings to be in accord with
Dharma, [F.31.b] I bring beings into the domain of the Dharma, I bring beings
into the way of the Dharma, I command beings in accord with Dharma, I
make beings dedicate themselves to the practice of the Dharma, I establish
beings in the understanding of the nature of the Dharma, and I establish
beings in a loving state of mind,
 in the power of great love, in the
strength of love, in an altruistic state of mind, in a happy state of mind, in a
sympathetic
 state of mind, in a caring state of mind, in a protective state
of mind,
 in a state of mind that never ceases to be protective of beings,
and in a state of mind of continuously aspiring to eliminate all suffering, and
I establish beings in a continuous conduct that leads them to the ultimate
happiness.
1030
1031
1032
1033
21. 26
“I also bring physical
 ease to beings by giving rise to the happiness of
serenity. I turn the continuums of their minds away from
 attachment to
the pleasures of saṃsāra. I bring
 beings to delight in the pleasures of the
Dharma. I cleanse them of all the stains of the kleśas.
 I purify them of all
bad qualities. I turn them away from the continuum of saṃsāra. I turn them
toward the ocean of the ways of the realm of Dharma. I burn away the
ignorance in their minds in order to end all rebirths in the states of existence.
I cause light
 to arise in their minds so that they attain the result that is
omniscience. I make the ocean of their minds clear so that they will give rise
to the strength of unassailable faith.

21. 27
“Noble one, in that way I have remained in this bodhisattva conduct called
the banner of great love, and I rule
 the kingdom in accord with the Dharma.
1039
21. 28
“Noble one, I do not cause the beings who dwell in my realm to be
frightened, terrified, or [F.32.a] alarmed or to horripilate.
21. 29
“Noble one, those beings who are poor and deprived of necessities, who
wish for food, who wish for drink, who wish for clothes, and who wish for
every kind of requisite all come before me. I open the door to the treasures
that I have previously accumulated, and I say to them, ‘Take whatever you
wish —all those things for which you would otherwise engage in the bad
actions of killing, taking what has not been given, sexual misconduct, lying,
slander, harsh speech, idle talk, craving, malice, false views, and attachment
to various incorrect views! All of those things have been provided by me,
and they are heaped at the doors in the streets, in the courtyards, at the
junctions of three streets, and at the crossroads of four streets in this great
city of Suprabha —anyone may take whatever they wish!’ I tell them this and
give it to them.
21. 30
“Noble one, all the beings who dwell in this great city are bodhisattvas
who follow the Mahāyāna.
21. 31
“Noble one, this great city of Suprabha appears to them in accordance
with their way of thinking: to some it appears small, while to some it appears
vast; to some the ground appears to be made of earth, while to some the
ground appears to be made of beryl jewels; to some it appears to be encircled
by a wall of clay, while to some it appears to be encircled by a wall of
precious diamonds
 and banners of invincibility; to some it appears to be
filled with pebbles and potsherds, to be uphill and downhill, and to have
many chasms and precipices, while to some it appears to have ground that is
covered and adorned with countless excellent precious jewels and to be as
flat as the palm of the hand; to some it appears to be made of earth,
 while
to some it appears to be adorned by countless precious dwellings, aerial
palaces, mansions, and kūṭāgāras [F.32.b] adorned by roof decks with
balustrades, spires, round windows,
 networks of strings of beads,
crescent moons, and trellises of lion adornments.
1040
1041
1042
21. 32
“Among the beings who live outside the city, there are those who, when I
was practicing bodhisattva conduct in past lives, gathered around me as
pupils through the four methods of gathering pupils. They have pure
motivation, have created the roots of merit, have served many buddhas,
aspire to omniscience, and are set on omniscience. To them the city appears
to be made of jewels. To the others it appears to be made of earth.
21. 33
“Noble one, when the beings who live in my realm, in the districts and
subdistricts, in the villages, towns, and markets, in the country and the
capital, are disturbed by the nature of the times in a world that has the five


---

degenerations and want to practice the path of the ten bad actions, then at
that time, wishing to benefit them, I enter the bodhisattva samādhi called
exercising power over the world through being motivated by great love.
21. 34
“Noble one, as soon as I rest in that samādhi, the fears, misfortunes,
hostilities, disputes, mental disturbances, and violent intentions of those
beings cease, are extinguished, are eliminated, and are brought to an end
through their attaining the nature of the bodhisattva samādhi called
exercising power over the world through being motivated by great love.
21. 35
“Noble one, stay a moment and you will see a sight.”
Then King Mahāprabha entered the bodhisattva samādhi called exercising
power over the world through being motivated by great love. [F.33.a]
21. 36
As soon as he entered the bodhisattva samādhi called exercising power over
the world through being motivated by great love, the great city of Suprabha and its
districts and subdistricts, its villages,
 towns, and markets, the land and
the kingdom, the capital, and its environs all shook in six ways.
1043
21. 37
When they shook, the precious walls, precious mansions, precious
interiors, precious houses, precious dwellings, precious aerial palaces,
precious kūṭāgāras, precious spires, precious balustrade rooftops, precious
round windows, precious balconies, precious toraṇas, precious crescents,
precious lattices of lion adornments, precious railings, precious disks,
precious canopies, precious strings of little spherical bells, precious bells,
precious banners, precious flags, and precious palm trees also shook, made
loud sounds, and jingled. When they resounded, they emitted beautiful,
delightful sounds, so that those people bowed and made obeisance in the
direction of King Mahāprabha.
21. 38
All those beings who dwelled within the great city of Suprabha
experienced increased happiness and joy, turned to face the direction of
King Mahāprabha, and prostrated their entire bodies on the ground in
homage.
21. 39
Those beings who lived in the villages, the towns, the marketplaces, the
land, the kingdom, the capital, and its environs all became blissful in mind
and body, and with happiness and joy they bowed down in the direction of
King Mahāprabha.
21. 40
The beings who had been reborn as animals all became kind toward one
another and wished to help one another. They all turned to look in the
direction of King Mahāprabha and bowed down to him.
21. 41
Even the land, all the mountain peaks, and the other lofty lands [F.33.b]
bowed toward King Mahāprabha.
21. 42
All the flowering trees, fruit trees, leafy trees, edible plants,
vegetation,
 crops,
 grasses, bushes, herbs, and forests turned in the
direction of King Mahāprabha and bowed down toward him.
1044
1045
1046


---

21. 43
All the springs,
 lakes, ponds, reservoirs, waterfalls, rivers, lotus ponds,
and wells in his realm turned and made the sounds of flowing in the
direction of King Mahāprabha.
1047
21. 44
Ten thousand nāga kings caused a mass of smoke of great black-
agarwood incense to form a cloud of perfume, from which came the
illumination of bright streaks of lightning, the roar of thunder, and a fine rain
of perfumed water that fell in all four directions.1048
21. 45
Ten thousand devas, such as the deva lords Śakra, Suyāma, Saṃtuṣita,
Sunirmita, and Vaśavartin gathered in the sky facing him and made offerings
to King Mahāprabha:
21. 46
The entire expanse of the sky resounded with the vast melodious sound
from clouds of a quintillion divine musical instruments.
21. 47
A gathering of countless apsarases created the adornment of sweet,
beautiful sounds from clouds of divine songs.
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine, precious flowers.
21. 48
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine incenses of various colors.
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine, precious garlands.
21. 49
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine powders of various colors.
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine, precious jewelry.
21. 50
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine, delicate,
 stainless clothing.
1049
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine [F.34.a] parasols of different kinds.
21. 51
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of beautiful lion
banners.
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of countless
precious flags shining with the blazing light of divine jewels.
21. 52
Airāvaṇa and all the kings of elephants were in the sky, and through the
inconceivable miraculous powers of the lords of the elephants, the leaders of
the herds, they manifested in the sky clouds of a variety of countless divine,
precious lotuses that covered the entire expanse of the sky; of countless
divine, precious hanging strings of jewels; of countless divine, precious
hanging clusters of streamers and wreaths; of hanging adornments of
countless varieties of divine, precious flower garlands; of hanging
adornments of countless varieties of divine, precious strings of jewelry; and
of hanging adornments of countless varieties of divine, precious wreaths of


---

flowers; the adornment of sky-covering clouds of perfume composed of
countless varieties of divine, precious kings of scents of different colors that
filled all directions with a lovely aroma; the adornment of rain from clouds of
divine, precious clothing of various colors; the adornment of rain from
clouds of a divine mass of incense smoke; the adornment of a delicate rain
from clouds of divine powders of different colors; and the adornment of rain
from sky-covering clouds of the sweet and melodious music and songs of
praise by a host of apsarases. [F.34.b]
21. 53
Countless hundreds of thousands of rākṣasa lords who dwell in the sea
and on the land, who dwell in our world realm of four continents, whose
food is flesh and whose drink is blood, who steal the vitality of those
creatures that live in the water and of deer, cattle, birds, oxen, horses,
elephants, donkeys, men, and women, whose minds have thoughts of anger
and who always harm and injure beings, all gained the highest motivation of
love and altruism; their faces having become serene, they became dedicated
to not causing violence or injury to any being, their thoughts upon the next
world after death, and with their palms together in homage, with the highest
happiness, they bowed in the direction of King Mahāprabha, experiencing
an unequaled vast bliss of mind and body.
21. 54
Hundreds of thousands of lords of yakṣas, mahoragas, piśācas, and
bhūtas with the highest motivation of love and altruism, their faces having
become serene and their thoughts upon the next world after death, became
dedicated to not causing violence or injury to any being. With their palms
together in homage, with the highest happiness, they bowed in the direction
of King Mahāprabha, experiencing an unequaled vast bliss of mind and
body.
21. 55
In the same way, for all beings in the four-continent world realm, fear,
misfortune, hostility, disputes, mental disturbances, and violent intentions
ceased, were extinguished, were eliminated, were brought to an end, and
were eradicated.
21. 56
In the same way as it was for the four-continent world realm, so it was that
for all beings throughout the great universe of a billion worlds, [F.35.a]
throughout a quintillion world realms in the ten directions, all fear,
misfortune, hostility, disputes, mental disturbances, and sinful and violent
intentions ceased, were extinguished, were eliminated, were brought to an
end, and were eradicated through their attaining the nature of the
bodhisattva samādhi called exercising power over the world through being
motivated by great love.
21. 57
Then King Mahāprabha arose from that samādhi and said to Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, “Noble one, I know only this wisdom of bodhisattva
conduct called the banner of great love.


---

21. 58
“How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who hold the immeasurable parasol of great love; who pervade
all the world realms with their motivation to bring happiness; who are
attendants for all beings through continual attendance to them; who are
dedicated to the protection of all beings applied equally to the highest, the
middling, and the lowest beings; who have a loving motivation that is like
the earth, for it is engaged in supporting all beings; who are like the disk of
the full moon sending the light rays of merit and wisdom equally to all
beings; who are like the disk of the sun because they shine the light of
wisdom on everything that is to be known; who are like lamps because they
dispel the deep darkness in the minds of all beings; who are like the precious
jewel that purifies water because they clear away the turbidity of deceit and
deception in the lakes of the minds of all beings; who are like the king of
wish-fulfilling jewels because they fulfill the aspirations and prayers of all
beings; who are like a great wind because they make them live in the
dwelling place of resting in samādhi, which is the great city
 of
omniscience? [F.35.b]
1050
21. 59
“How could I measure their mountain of merit? How could I view the sky
that is adorned by the myriads of stars of their qualities? How could I know
the circle of air
 that is their great prayers? How could I measure their
power of the equality of all phenomena? How could I explain their praises of
the array of the Mahāyāna? How could I describe their special way of
completely good conduct? How could I reveal the gateway to the great
samādhi of the bodhisattvas? How could I describe their clouds of great
compassion?
1051
21. 60
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a capital city called
Sthirā. There dwells an upāsikā by the name of Acalā. Go to her and ask her,
‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
21. 61
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
King Mahāprabha, circumambulated King Mahāprabha many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from King Mahāprabha. [B3]
