MUKTĀSĀRA
49. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, eventually arrived in the southern
region, and in the town of Bharukaccha he approached the goldsmith
Muktāsāra. He bowed his head to the feet of the goldsmith Muktāsāra and
then, standing before him with his palms together in homage, said, “Ārya, I
have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I
do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in
what way they should practice it.
49. 2
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
49. 3
When he had said that, the goldsmith Muktāsāra said, “Noble one, I know
the bodhisattva liberation called the display of pure
 unimpeded memory. I
continuously seek the Dharma at the feet of the tathāgatas in the ten
directions.

49. 4
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the display of
pure
 unimpeded memory. How could I know the conduct or describe the
qualities of the bodhisattvas who have the fearless lion’s roar and are
established in great merit and wisdom?

49. 5
“Depart, noble one. In the forest beside this town of Bharukaccha resides a
householder by the name of Sucandra who has a continuously shining
house. [F.277.b] Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
and practice bodhisattva conduct?’ ”
49. 6
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
goldsmith Muktāsāra. He circumambulated the goldsmith Muktāsāra many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back
at him again and again, he departed from the goldsmith Muktāsāra.
