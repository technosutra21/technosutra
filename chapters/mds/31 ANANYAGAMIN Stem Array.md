Chapter 31
ANANYAGĀMIN
31. 1
Sudhana, 
the 
head 
merchant’s 
son, 
his 
mind 
having 
acquired
Avalokiteśvara’s verses of wisdom,
 had not had enough of gazing on the
bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, but so as not to disobey his instruction, Sudhana
went to where the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin was.
1267
31. 2
He bowed his head to the feet of the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin. Then he
stood before him and, with his hands placed together in homage, said,
“Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
31. 3
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
31. 4
Then the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin said, “Noble one, I have attained the
bodhisattva liberation called the arising of every gateway.”1268
31. 5
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, at the feet of which tathāgata did you attain the
bodhisattva liberation called the arising of every gateway? How far from here is
that world realm? How long did it take to come from that world realm?”
31. 6
The bodhisattva Ananyagāmin said, “Noble one, this is something that is
difficult to comprehend for beings such as the śramaṇas and brahmins in
this world with its devas, humans, and asuras. It is the power of the
bodhisattvas, the irreversible diligence of the bodhisattvas, and the
unsurpassable conduct of the bodhisattvas.
31. 7
“Noble one, those who are not in the care of a kalyāṇamitra, who are not
regarded by the buddhas, who have not accumulated the roots of merit, who
do not have a pure motivation, who have not attained the faculties of a
bodhisattva, and who do not have the eyes of wisdom [F.74.b] will not be
able to hear of it, grasp it, believe in it, or comprehend it.”

31. 8
Sudhana said, “Tell it to me, for I am apprehended
 by the buddhas and
in the care of kalyāṇamitras, and I have faith and aspiration!”
1269
31. 9
The bodhisattva Ananyagāmin said, “Noble one, I have come from a world
realm in the eastern direction that is called Śrīgarbhavatī, the buddha realm
of the Tathāgata Samanta śrī saṃbhava. I obtained the bodhisattva liberation
called the arising of every gateway at the feet of the Tathāgata Samanta śrī-
saṃbhava.
31. 10
“Noble one, as many kalpas as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya
of buddha realms passed while I came from the world realm Śrīgarbhavatī.
31. 11
“With each development of an aspiration, I took as many steps as there are
atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms. With each step, I passed
as many buddha realms as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of
buddha realms. There was a tathāgata in each of those buddha realms, and I
perceived all those buddha bhagavats. To all those tathāgatas I made
offerings that were authorized by the tathāgatas and were unsurpassable,
composed of the mind, and sealed by the noncomposite nature of
phenomena and gave rise to joy in bodhisattvas.
31. 12
“I saw in those world realms an ocean of beings, and I perceived the
ocean of all their minds. I knew the wheels of all their faculties, and I
manifested physical bodies in accord with their aspirations, proclaimed the
words of the Dharma, radiated a halo of light, brought them the gift of
various necessities, and empowered my own body, [F.75.a] so that I could
continuously be engaged in ripening and guiding them.
31. 13
“In the same way that I came from the east, I came from the south, from
the west, from the north, from the northeast, from the southeast, from the
southwest, from the northwest, from below, and from above.
31. 14
“Noble one, I know only the bodhisattva liberation called the arising of every
gateway. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
bodhisattvas who face in all directions; who have a scope of wisdom that is
without division; who distribute their bodies throughout the realm of
phenomena; who act in accord with the thoughts and aspirations of all
beings; who pervade all realms with their bodies; who act in conformance
with all phenomena; who have arrived at the equality of the three times; who
have bodies that are equal to the range of phenomena in every direction;
who illuminate every range of worlds of beings; who have no
conceptualization of the range of tathāgatas; who enter all regions without
impediment; and who dwell in the state that has no location?
31. 15
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, there is a city named
Dvāravatī. There dwells the deity by the name of Mahādeva. Go to him and
ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How
should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”

31. 16
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bodhisattva Ananyagāmin, circumambulated the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin
many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking
back again and again, departed from the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin. [F.75.b]
