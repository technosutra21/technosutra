INDRIYEŚVARA
15. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, recited,
 promulgated, presented,
investigated, elucidated, reflected on, described, taught, contemplated,
bestowed, understood, was immersed in, repeated again and again, realized,
propounded, illuminated, and surveyed the teaching of the bhikṣu
Sudarśana.

He eventually, with an entourage of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and
gandharvas, arrived at the city of Sumukha in the land called Śramaṇa-
maṇḍala.
15. 3
He searched for the boy Indriyeśvara until the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and
gandharvas in the sky above called down, “Noble one, [F.2.a] the boy
Indriyeśvara, accompanied by ten thousand other children, is playing in the
sand at the conflux of the rivers.”
15. 4
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went into the city of Sumukha
toward the confluence of the rivers. When he arrived there, he saw the boy
Indriyeśvara accompanied by ten thousand children, playing in the sand.
15. 5
When he saw the boy Indriyeśvara, he approached him, bowed his head
to the boy Indriyeśvara’s feet, circumambulated the boy Indriyeśvara many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and then sat down
before the boy Indriyeśvara. He placed the palms of his hands together and
said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment. How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? In
what way does a bodhisattva practice it?”
15. 6
“Ārya, I have heard that you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas.
Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct
and in what way they practice it!”
15. 7
Indriyeśvara said, “Noble one, Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has taught me
writing, numbers, symbols, and counting so that I entered through the
gateway called the wisdom that possesses clairvoyance in all crafts.

“Thus, noble one, [F.2.b] I know all writing and terminology in this world;
all numbers, calculations, symbols, the knowledge of dice throwing,
 and
the knowledge of the various crafts; physiology; methods to cure poisoning;
exorcising śoṣas, apasmāras, bhūtas, pretas, and demons; the knowledge of
where to establish villages, towns, marketplaces, cities,
 parks, and forest

windows, and kūṭāgāras; the knowledge of how to make various machines
and chariots; the knowledge of good and bad omens, omens of danger and
safety; the knowledge of the practices of farming and business; the
knowledge of the analysis of the signs of the movement and characteristics
of the limbs and the minor extensions of the body; the knowledge of the
ways of purifying the path of karma that leads to the higher realms or the
lower existences; the knowledge of good and bad groups and offerings; the
knowledge of the accumulations that lead to the higher existences or to the
lower existences; the knowledge of the accumulations that lead to the
Śrāvakayāna and Pratyeka buddhayāna; the knowledge of the accumulations
that lead to the level of the tathāgatas; and the knowledge of the processes
of application to causes and actions.

“I make all beings enter into those knowledges, settle them in those
knowledges, establish them in those knowledges, make them study those
knowledges, make them practice those knowledges, make them stable in
those knowledges, make them dedicated to those knowledges, make them
complete those knowledges, make them accomplished in those knowledges,

In front of Indriyeśvara there was a heap of sand that was many yojanas
high. [F.4.b] He counted how many grains of sand there were in that heap,
beginning with “the number of grains of sand in this mound” and
continuing until he said, “there are an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of grains
of sand in this heap.” Having taught Sudhana through the teaching that
stipulated the number of grains of sand in that heap of sand, he said, “Noble
one, this method of counting of the bodhisattvas continues from one world
realm to another. With this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, one can
calculate the number of the entire extent of world realms in the eastern
direction. In the same way, with this method of counting of the bodhisattvas,
one can calculate the number of the entire extent of world realms in the

southern direction, in the western direction, in the northern direction, in the
northeastern direction, in the southeastern direction, in the southwestern
direction, in the northwestern direction, in the upward direction, and in the
downward direction.

“Noble one, with this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, the entire
extent of the succession of the names of world realms in the ten directions
are taught; with this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, the entire
extent of the succession of the names of world realms in the ten directions is
counted.
15. 13
“Just as the entire extent of the succession of world realms in the ten
directions is taught, in the same way the succession of names of kalpas in
the ten directions is taught, the succession of the names of buddhas is
taught, the succession of the names of Dharmas is taught, the succession of
the names of beings is taught, and the succession of the names of actions is
taught, so that all these are comprehended.

“With this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, the entirety of however
many successions of names that can be taught and that are in the ten
directions is comprehended in full. [F.5.a]

“With this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, the entirety of however
many successions of names that can be taught and that are in the ten

15. 16
“However, noble one, in that way I know only this light of bodhisattva
wisdom that is the possession of the clairvoyance of crafts that is the
knowledge of all phenomena. How could I know the conduct of the
bodhisattvas who engage with the number of all beings, who engage with
the number of all the accumulations of Dharmas, who engage with the
number of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and who have power over the
wheel of the names of all the Dharmas? How could I describe their qualities?
How could I reveal
 the range of their activity? How could I elucidate the
scope of their knowledge? How could I praise their strengths? How could I
proclaim their resolute intentions? How could I cast light
 on their
accumulations? How could I explain their prayers? How could I teach their
conduct? How could I speak of their pure perfections? How could I make
clear their pure attainments? How could I describe the range
 of their
samādhis? How could I comprehend the light of their wisdom?

“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called Samudra-
pratiṣṭhāna, where dwells an upāsikā by the name of Prabhūtā. Go to her
and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How
should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”

When Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, heard the words of the
kalyāṇamitra, the hairs on his body rose, he felt a powerful great happiness,
and he had great joy in his mind. He had obtained this rare, wonderful jewel
of motivation. He had developed the motivation of intending to benefit many
beings. He had the power to encounter the successive appearances of the
buddhas. [F.5.b] He was dedicated to understanding the pure field of the
Dharma. He was dedicated to demonstrating setting forth to liberation in
different ways appropriate to all places.
 He knew the distinct ranges of
activity of the buddhas in the levels of the three times. He had a state of
mind that had arisen from an inexhaustible ocean of merit. He had the power
of the illumination of great wisdom. He had broken open the gate that sealed
beings within the city
 of the three realms.

Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of the boy Indriyeśvara,
circumambulated the boy Indriyeśvara many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from the boy Indriyeśvara.
