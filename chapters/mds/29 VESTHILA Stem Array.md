VEṢṬHILA
29. 1
Then Sudhana went to the town of Śubhapāraṃgama [F.66.a] and
approached the householder Veṣṭhila. He bowed his head to his feet, stood
before him, and, with his hands placed together in homage, said, “Ārya, I
have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I
do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in
what way they should practice it.
29. 2
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
29. 3
Veṣṭhila said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called
the attainment of the summit of inexhaustibility.
29. 4
“Noble one, from my mind’s viewpoint, a tathāgata has not passed into
nirvāṇa, does not pass into nirvāṇa, and will not pass into nirvāṇa in any
world other than as a way to bring beings who are to be guided under his
control, not as a way to enter truly complete nirvāṇa.
29. 5
“Noble one, in that way, when I opened the door of the sandalwood-
throne shrine of the Tathāgata, I attained, by opening the door of the shrine,
the bodhisattva samādhi called the display of the unceasing family of the buddhas.
“Noble one, in each instant of mind I rest in this samādhi, and I attain
many special features.”
29. 6
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, what is the scope of that samādhi?”
Veṣṭhila replied, “Noble one, when I am resting in this samādhi, [F.66.b]
there appear to me all the tathāgatas, such as Kāśyapa, in a continuous
succession of one buddha after another within the lineage of this world: all
the tathāgatas such as Kanaka muni, Krakucchanda, Viśvabhuk, Śikhin,
Vipaśyin, Tiṣya, Puṣya, Yaśottara, and Padmottara. I see in the consecutive
appearances of the buddhas the unceasing succession of one buddha after
another, a hundred buddhas in one instant of mind. In the next instant of

mind I perceive a thousand buddhas. In the next instant of mind I perceive a
hundred thousand buddhas. In the same way I see ten million buddhas, a
thousand million
 buddhas, ten thousand million
 buddhas, a million
million buddhas,
 ten million billion buddhas,
 ten million million
billion
 buddhas, a hundred thousand million billion
 buddhas, and ten
million million billion
 buddhas, and so on, until in a subsequent moment
of mind I perceive an inexpressible number of inexpressible numbers of
buddhas appearing in succession. In the next instant of mind I see
tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in Jambudvīpa. In the next instant of
mind I see tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in an inexpressible number
of inexpressible numbers of buddha realms.

29. 7
“I also perceive the successive accumulations for the first development of
the aspiration to enlightenment by those tathāgatas. I perceive the
miraculous powers they attain through their first development of the
aspiration to enlightenment. I perceive their pure fulfillment of their different
prayers. I perceive their pure conduct. I perceive their complete
accomplishment of the perfections. I perceive their attainment of all the
bodhisattva bhūmis. I perceive their pure attainment of patience. I perceive
their roaring
 that disperses the disturbances of the māras. I perceive the
display of the miracles of their complete buddhahood. I perceive the
purification of their different buddha realms. I perceive their different
ripening of beings. I perceive their different gatherings of followers. I
perceive their different halos of light. I perceive their supremacy in turning
the wheel of the Dharma. I perceive their attainment of the miraculous
powers, miracles, and miraculous manifestations of buddhahood.
1231
29. 8
“I remember and keep the Dharma teachings of these tathāgatas clearly
and distinctly. Through my memory I possess them. With my intelligence
I understand them. With reverence
 I distinguish among them. With my
intellect I comprehend them. With my wisdom I illuminate them.
1232
1233
29. 9
“I also see and know the future succession of buddhas, such as Maitreya. I
see a hundred buddhas in one instant of mind. In the next instant of mind I
perceive a thousand buddhas, and so on, up to the instant of mind in which I
see tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in an inexpressible number of
inexpressible numbers of buddha realms.
29. 10
“I also perceive the successive accumulations for the first development of
the aspiration to enlightenment by those tathāgatas. I perceive the
miraculous powers they attain through their first development of the

prayers. I perceive their pure conduct. I perceive their complete
accomplishment of the perfections. [F.67.a] I perceive their attainment of all
the bodhisattva bhūmis. I perceive their pure attainment of patience. I

“I remember and keep the Dharma teachings of these tathāgatas clearly

intelligence
 I understand them. With reverence
 I distinguish among
them. With my intellect I comprehend them. With my wisdom I illuminate
them.
1235
1236
29. 12
“Just as I see and know the succession of buddhas in the past and in the
future in the lineage of this world realm, I see and know in the lineage of
world realms in the ten directions as numerous as the atoms in an
inexpressible number of inexpressible numbers of buddha realms the
succession of tathāgatas in the past and in the future.
29. 13
“I also perceive the successive accumulations for the first development of
the aspiration to enlightenment by those tathāgatas, and so on.
29. 14
“I know and comprehend the unbroken, unceasing succession of the
buddhas. It is unequaled;
 it is known through faith, is known through the
diligence and resolve of bodhisattvas, augments the power of the diligence
of bodhisattvas, and cannot be overcome by the entire world, by all śrāvakas
and pratyeka buddhas, or by bodhisattvas who have not entered its scope.
1237
29. 15
“I see and know the succession of the present tathāgatas that reside in
world realms in the ten directions, such as Vairocana.
29. 16
“I see a hundred buddhas in one instant of mind. In the next instant of
mind I perceive a thousand buddhas, and so on, up to the instant of mind in
which I see tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in an inexpressible number
of inexpressible numbers of buddha realms.
29. 17
“When I wish to see a certain tathāgata, I see him. [F.68.a] I hear all that
has been taught, is being taught, and will be taught by those buddhas, those
bhagavats. When I have heard them, I retain them. Through my memory I
possess them. With my intelligence
 I understand them. With
reverence
 I distinguish among them. With my intellect I comprehend
them. With my wisdom I illuminate them.
1238
1239
29. 18
“Noble one, I know this bodhisattva liberation called the attainment of the
summit of inexhaustibility, but how could I know the conduct or describe the
qualities of the bodhisattvas who know the three times in a single instant;
who in one fraction of an instant of their practice dwell in an array of
samādhis; who have entered into the sunlight of the tathāgatas;
 who
1240

understand the equality of all concepts and misconceptions; who have
realized the samādhi that is equal to that of all the buddhas; who act in the
nonduality of self, beings, and buddhas; who are in the domain of the
display of the Dharma of natural luminosity; who have cut through the net of
the world with the device of wisdom; who act without disturbing the seal
of the Dharma of the tathāgatas; who have the scope of wisdom that
understands the entire realm of phenomena; who have the scope of wisdom
that understands the Dharma teaching of all the tathāgatas?
1241
29. 19
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, there is the mountain named
Potalaka. There dwells the bodhisattva by the name of Avalokiteśvara. Go to
him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ” [F.68.b]
29. 20
Then he spoke these two verses:
“Depart, Sudhana! In the center of the glorious king of the waters1242
Is beautiful Potalaka, king of mountains, the residence of heroes.
It has excellent trees made of jewels, is covered with flowers,
And is endowed with parks, lotus ponds, and flowing streams.
29. 21
“Wise Avalokiteśvara who benefits beings —
That resolute one
 dwells on that supreme mountain.
1243
Go to him, Sudhana, and you will be taught
The qualities of
 the Guides, the entry into the way of vast goodness.”
1244
29. 22
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
householder Veṣṭhila, circumambulated the householder Veṣṭhila many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back
again and again, departed from the householder Veṣṭhila. [B5]
