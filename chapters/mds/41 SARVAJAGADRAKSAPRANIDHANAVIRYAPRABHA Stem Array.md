SARVA JAGAD RAKṢĀ PRAṆIDHĀNA VĪRYA-
PRABHĀ
41. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went to where the night goddess Sarva-
jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā was. He saw the night goddess Sarva-
jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā in the center of her entourage, seated
upon a throne that contained kings of jewels that illuminated the dwellings
of all beings. She had a body covered completely in a net of jewels that
illuminated the ways of the realm of phenomena. Her body revealed the
images of the sun, the moon, and all the planets, stars, and constellations.
She had a body that manifested to the perception of beings in accordance
with their wishes. She had a body such that her own body was perceived by
all beings as having the same form as their bodies. She had a body that
manifested perceptions of a vast, centerless, edgeless ocean of skin colors.
She had a body that manifested practicing all paths of the practice of
conduct. She had a body that could be perceived from every kind of
orientation.
 She had a body that was present in all worlds, filling all
directions with the sound of thunder from the cloud of the Dharma and with
various miraculous manifestations. She had a body that reached throughout
the realm of space, at all times looking at how to benefit all beings. She had a
body that paid homage and bowed down at the feet of all tathāgatas. She
had a body that came before all beings, aiding them in the accumulation of
roots of merit. [F.180.a] She had a body that possessed the mindfulness of
keeping and never deviating from the motivation to accomplish and fulfill
the prayer to receive and possess clouds of Dharma directly from all the
tathāgatas. She had a body that filled all principal and intermediate
directions with light that had no edge or center. She had a body that
manifested the illumination and the spreading light of the lamp of Dharma,
dispelling the darkness in all beings. She had a body that manifested as a
stainless body of the wisdom that phenomena are like illusions. She had a
1627

body that manifested as a Dharma body free of darkness and dust. She had a
body that appeared with the nature of being an illusion. She had a mind free
of darkness that had realized the true nature. She had attained the
illumination in all aspects of the light of wisdom. She had a mental body that
was completely free of illness and had no pain. She had appeared from the
realm of the enduring and indestructible Dharma body. She had a body that
was the pure body of the stainless true nature, the state completely without
kleśas, and which had the nature of the unlocated blessing of the tathāgatas.
41. 2
When he had seen her, he bowed his head, and, remembering the ways of
seeing her, which were as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm, he
bowed down to the ground, prostrating himself for a long time.
 Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son, then stood up from the ground, placed his palms
together, and, looking at the body of the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā-
praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā, he gained ten pure perceptions, and through
gaining them he gained commonality with all kalyāṇamitras.
1628
1629
41. 3
What were those ten? [F.180.b] (1) He gained the perception of his own
mind being among the kalyāṇamitras in order to have all the diligence for
undertaking the attainment of omniscience. (2) He gained the perception of
the pure nature of the ripening of his own karma so as to attain the
accomplishment of vast roots of merit from honoring kalyāṇamitras. (3) He
gained the perception of the adornment of bodhisattva conduct so as to
remain in the conduct that is the adornment of all prayers. (4) He gained the
perception of the accomplishment of all the Dharmas of the buddhas so as to
practice the path of the instructions of all the tathāgatas. (5) He gained the
perception of the arising of sensations so as to see the radiance of practicing
the unsurpassable Dharma that is the field of all buddhas. (6) He gained the
perception of a single setting forth so as to have the pure conduct and prayer
of setting forth through the completely good conduct.
 (7) He gained the
perception of the origin of the ocean of the merit of omniscience so as to
increase the accumulation of all good qualities. (8) He gained the perception
of protecting, increasing, and completing incomplete
 good qualities so as
to increase the power of diligence for omniscience in the enlightenment of
buddhahood. (9) He gained the perception of the completion of all roots of
merit so as to fulfill the wishes of all beings. (10) He gained the perception of
the accomplishment of all goals among kalyāṇamitras so as to be established
in having the power of the qualities
 of all bodhisattvas. [F.181.a]
1630
1631
1632
41. 4
Those are the ten pure perceptions he gained. Having gained them, he
gained from the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā
commonalities with bodhisattvas that were as numerous as the atoms in a
buddha realm.

41. 6
In that way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, gained a state of delight.
He attained those pure perceptions through looking at the night goddess
Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā. He attained these and other
commonalities, as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm, from the night
goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā.
41. 7
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, because of the night goddess Sarva-
jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā, entered ways of seeing that were as
numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm; [F.184.b] he attained pure
perceptions, without end or center, of the kalyāṇamitras; and he entered
ways of commonality that were as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm.
41. 8
With his upper robe removed from one shoulder and with his palms
together, he bowed in the direction of the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā-
praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā and recited these verses:
41. 9
“I regard my own mind and my aspiration
To enlightenment to be firm and irreversible.
As it is in your mind, so it is in mine.
And that which is mine has today become firm. {1}
41. 10
“I have been purified of everything that is sinful;
I have attained the unequaled
 ripening of good karma.
1641
When I look and see you, beautiful one,
I accumulate inexhaustible
 good qualities. {2}
1642
41. 11
“My mind is adorned by a river of qualities.
Through dedication to benefiting beings in various ways,
I practice a conduct that is thus adorned
Within all realms until the last of future kalpas. {3}
41. 12
“Āryā, in order to show your kindness to me,
You have revealed the accomplishment of all Dharmas.
I pray that for my benefit
 you will decide to care for me
1643
And bestow on me the highest teaching of the Dharma. {4}
41. 13
“You have repelled the path of falling into lower existences.
You have shown the pure path to the higher existences.


---

You have taught the path
 to omniscience,
1644
Which is the way followed by every sugata. {5}
41. 14
“Incomparable, marvelous one, I have in your presence1645
Developed the supreme conception of setting forth.
The pure entranceway to the Dharma of omniscience
Is immeasurable and stainless, like space. {6}
41. 15
“Today I have developed the immeasurable perception of you
As the excellent source of immeasurable omniscience.
An ocean of merit as immeasurable as space
Arises in the mind with every instant. {7} [F.185.a]
41. 16
“Āryā, I pray you empower me with the perfections.
I pray that you augment inconceivable merit.
Having augmented all goodness and qualities,
Cause me to quickly attain the level of omniscience. {8}
41. 17
“I constantly perceive the kalyāṇamitras
As the complete path to omniscience.
Therefore they will be made content
By my quickly perfecting all good qualities.
 {9}
1646
41. 18
“Therefore, from this come all benefits
And the accomplishment of good qualities.
I shall accomplish this path to omniscience
And proclaim it to beings through infinite praises. {10}
41. 19
“You are my teacher of immeasurable qualities.
You are my guide toward the qualities of omniscience.
Āryā, even in countless quintillions of kalpas
I will not be able to repay your kindness.” {11}
41. 20
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having recited those verses, said to
the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā, “Goddess, if you
teach me this inconceivable scope of your bodhisattva liberation, then,
goddess, what is the name of this liberation? Goddess, how long has it been
since you entered upon attaining the highest, complete enlightenment?
How long will it be before you attain the highest, complete enlightenment of
buddhahood?”
41. 21
The night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā said to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, this liberation is called the
origin of the roots of merit that inspire the ripening of all beings. Noble one, through
possessing this liberation, having realized the equal nature of all

phenomena, [F.185.b] having comprehended the nature of all phenomena,
and having relied on the Dharma that has no location, I have risen above all
worlds, understood the differentiation of the forms of all phenomena, and,
understanding the true nature that has no distinct color, no variation of
color, no separate aspect of color, no concept of color, no blue color, no
yellow color, no red color, no white color, no dissimilarities, no variety, no
different aspects, no concepts, no blue, no yellow, no red, and no white
colors,
 I have form bodies of many categories of color; various kinds of

of the ways of the entire realm of phenomena, and through having acquired

the blessing of the tathāgatas I manifest to beings who are guided through
seeing, who are guided through hearing, who are guided through
remembering, who are guided through creating emanations of Dharma
wheels, who are guided through the time having come for their ripening,
who are guided through the manifestation of form bodies, who are guided
through acts of veneration, who are guided through realization, who are
guided through manifesting various miracles and emanations, and who are
guided through manifesting the perception of countless miracles and
emanations, through the power of their aspirations, the power of the time,
the power of turning them away from bad actions, the power of establishing
them in the accomplishment of good actions, the power of accomplishing the
karma of great prayers of the past, the power of the might of omniscience,
the power of the qualities of attaining the miraculous manifestations of vast
bodhisattva liberations, the power of the arising of the strength of great
compassion that creates a refuge for all beings, and the power of the

41. 22
“Noble one, in that way I am established in this bodhisattva liberation
called the origin of the roots of merit that inspire the ripening of all beings, and
comprehending the true nature of phenomena
 to be without division, I
manifest the shapes and colors of bodies without limit or center, [F.188.a] and
from each manifested body come the perceptions within worlds of an
endless and centerless ocean of colors, and from each manifested color
clouds of light rays without limit or center are radiated, and from each light
ray the images of buddha realms without limit or center are manifested, and
in each buddha realm tathāgatas without limit or center are manifested, and
each tathāgata manifests buddha miracles without limit or center, and thus I
inspire those who have
 past roots of merit, and I cause those who have
not generated roots of merit to generate them, those who have generated
them to increase them, and those who have increased them to make them
vast.
1655
1656
41. 23
“In each instant of mind, I establish realms of beings without limit or
center on the level of irreversible progress toward the highest, complete
enlightenment. [B12]
41. 24
“Moreover, noble one, you asked, ‘How long has it been since you entered
upon attaining the highest, complete enlightenment? For how many
hundreds of kalpas have you been practicing bodhisattva conduct?’
Through the blessing of the buddhas I will teach you the answer.
41. 25
“Noble one, the domain of wisdom of the bodhisattvas is a field of
perception without thoughts, concepts, or assumptions.
 There is no
establishment or description of saṃsāra as being long or being short. There
1657
1658


---

is no establishment or description of defiled kalpas, pure kalpas, short
kalpas, great kalpas, numerous kalpas, [F.188.b] differing kalpas, a variety of
kalpas, or irregular
 kalpas.
1659
41. 26
“Why is that? Noble one, the domain of wisdom of the bodhisattvas
naturally has a completely pure nature, is free of all nets of
conceptualization, has transcended all the mountains of obscurations, and,
arising in their aspirations, illuminates all beings whom it is time to ripen
and guide accordingly.
41. 27
“Noble one, it is like this: the disk of the sun itself has no enumeration of
and does not exist as days and nights, but when it sets, that is perceived as
sunset,
 and when the disk of the sun rises, that is said to be daytime.
1660
41. 28
“Noble one, in that way, in the domain of wisdom of the bodhisattvas
there are no thoughts, concepts, or assumptions; there are also no
perceptions of residing in saṃsāra and no division into times. However,
through the power of the time for ripening all beings, that domain of wisdom
without concepts that arises from the aspiration of the bodhisattvas has the
enumeration of numbers concerning the duration of kalpas and the
perceptions of saṃsāra. There is the enumeration of the duration of past and
future kalpas in the conceptless domain of wisdom.
41. 29
“Noble one, it is like the analogy of the disk of the sun in the realm of
space, which appears as a perceived image on all jewel mountains, all jewel
trees, all jewel vessels, all jewel quarries, all oceans, all lakes and ponds,
[F.189.a] in all bowls of water, and to all beings. It appears as a direct
perception for all beings. The image of the disk of the sun appears in the
atoms of all jewels, but the disk of the sun is not present in the mountains of
jewels, does not enter the jewel trees, and so on, up to atoms of jewels, is not
contained within precious stones, does not come to jewel quarries, does not
enter oceans, and does not go into bowls of water, yet it appears within
them.
41. 30
“Noble one, in that same way, bodhisattva mahāsattvas have risen high
above the ocean of saṃsāra and are in the sky of the realm of Dharma of the
tathāgatas, active within the field of activity that is the sky of the nature of
phenomena, and dwell in the realm of the sky of peace. However, in order to
ripen and guide all beings in all the paths of existence and births, they
appear in bodies that are the same as those of all beings, but without being
stained by the faults of saṃsāra, without being accompanied by thoughts
and concepts, without the perception of a kalpa being long, and without the
perception of a kalpa being short.
41. 31
“Why is that? Because bodhisattvas have transcended error, have
transcended erroneous perception, mentation, and views, have comprehend
all worlds to be like dreams, [F.189.b] realize all worlds to be like magical


---

conjurations, have attained the realm of the wisdom that there are no beings,
view all phenomena exactly as they truly are, and, through the power of the
vast domain of compassion and of great prayers, appear to all beings in
order to ripen and guide all beings.
41. 32
“Noble one, it is like the analogy of a ship on a great river, and so on,
which is continuously engaged in ferrying beings across. It does not stay at
the opposite shore, it does not stay at the near shore, and it does not remain
in between.
41. 33
“Noble one, in the same way, bodhisattvas, through the power of the ship
of the great perfections, are engaged in ferrying beings across the flow of the
river of saṃsāra, doing so without fear of the near shore and without a
conception of the bliss of the far shore. Yet they are continuously engaged in
the practice of bringing all beings to liberation while maintaining
bodhisattva conduct throughout countless kalpas without attachment to the
different kinds of kalpas. They do not practice bodhisattva conduct with the
perception that the passing of a kalpa is a long time.
41. 34
“Noble one, it is like the analogy of the realm of space that is the domain of
the sky, the vast realm of phenomena, which though it includes the creation,
destruction, and passing of all world realms is without thought and is
naturally pure and completely undefiled, undisturbed, unobscured, and
unwearied by possessing all realms throughout all future time. [F.190.a]
41. 35
“Noble one, in the same way, the domain of the space of the wisdom of
bodhisattvas’ aspiration, with the revolving of the circle of the wind of great
prayers, holds back beings from all the abysses of the lower existences
without ever wearying; it brings them onto the path to happiness without
being disheartened, brings them onto the path to omniscience without
becoming despondent, is undisturbed by any kleśas, and is not afflicted by
any of the harms of saṃsāra.
41. 36
“Noble one, it is like the analogy of a man, with all the larger and smaller
parts of the body complete, who is a magical conjuration and in whose body
ten qualities are absent. What are those ten? They are (1) inhalation, (2)
exhalation, (3) cold, (4) warmth, (5) hunger, (6) thirst, (7) happiness, (8)
unhappiness, (9) birth, aging, sickness, and death,
 and (10) injury.
1661
41. 37
“Noble one, in the same way, bodhisattvas have forms that emerge as the
magical conjuration of wisdom; they have bodies that are not separate from
the realm of the Dharma, and which are born in order to ripen all beings in
the classes of existence within saṃsāra.1662
41. 38
“Although they are present in all kalpas, there are ten qualities that they
do not have.


---

“What are those ten? They are (1) delight in saṃsāra, (2) sadness on being
reborn within a class of existence within saṃsāra, (3) dedication to the
pleasures of the senses, (4) an angry mind, (5) desire for enjoyments, (6)
being afflicted by all the kleśas, (7) experiencing the sensation of suffering,
(8) fear through being born in frightening existences, (9) yearning for an
existence, and (10) clinging to an existence.
41. 39
“However, noble one, I shall also teach, through the blessing of the
buddhas, in order to increase the power of the vast bodhisattva prayers of
future bodhisattvas. [F.190.b]
41. 40
“Noble one, in the past, in times gone by, beyond as many kalpas as there
are atoms in an ocean of world realms, and even further beyond, there was at
that time, in that time, a world realm called Ratnaprabhā.
41. 41
“Noble one, in that world realm called Ratnaprabhā there was kalpa called
Suprabha. In that kalpa called Suprabha there appeared ten thousand
buddhas.
41. 42
“Noble one, the first of those ten thousand buddhas in that kalpa who
appeared in that world was the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha
Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, who was one with wisdom
and conduct,
 a sugata, one who knows the world’s beings, an
unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a teacher of devas and humans, a
buddha, and a bhagavat. He was the first of them all to attain the highest,
complete enlightenment of buddhahood.
1663
41. 43
“Noble one, that tathāgata appeared not far from the royal capital named
Rativyūhā in the central four-continent world. To the east of the royal capital
Rativyūhā, there was a forest called Suprabha. In Suprabha Forest there was
a bodhimaṇḍa called Ratna kusuma megha. At that bodhimaṇḍa called Ratna-
kusuma megha there appeared a lion throne on which there was a shining
jewel lotus.
 It was upon this that the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha
Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja 
attained 
the 
highest,
complete enlightenment of buddhahood.
1664
41. 44
“At that time, in that time, the lifespan of humans was ten thousand years,
but there occurred killing, [F.191.a] stealing, sexual misconduct, lying,
slander, harsh speech, meaningless talk, avariciousness, maliciousness, and
wrong views, and in that way the path of the ten bad actions became
widespread and enduring.
41. 45
“The 
Bhagavat 
Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja
remained
 at the bodhimaṇḍa, teaching the Dharma to bodhisattvas,
 in
order to ripen the roots of merit of the lords of the world and Jambudvīpa
humans who had served past jinas.
1665
1666

41. 46
“At that time, in that time, in the royal capital Rativyūhā, there lived King
Jayaprabha, who in order to subdue them imprisoned many hundreds of
thousands of people who had stolen, robbed, performed criminal acts, killed,
performed sexual misconduct, lied, slandered, spoken harshly, and talked
meaninglessly, who were avaricious, were malicious, held wrong views,
were attached to desires contrary to the Dharma, were overwhelmed by
irresistible desires, were encompassed by wrong Dharma, and who
committed sinful actions, acted wrathfully, did not create merit, did not
save
 those who were in fear, did not respect their mothers, did not
respect their fathers, were not reverential to mendicants, were not
reverential to brahmins, were not respectful of āryas,
 and committed
transgressions.
1667
1668
41. 47
“King Jayaprabha had a son whose name was Vijitāvin. He was
handsome, attractive, a delight to see, and he had a very beautiful, perfect,
magnificent complexion. He had twenty-eight of the signs of a great being.
He went up on the roof of the palace called Sarasvati saṃgīti, [F.191.b] where
he stayed, encircled by an entourage of many women. He heard the terrified
cries of the beings who had been put into prison and were tightly bound by
various instruments. On hearing them he became unhappy, and his mind
was not at ease. Great compassion arose in him, and he descended from the
roof of the palace. He entered the prison and inside that strict prison saw the
beings who in darkness were imprisoned, bound in wooden stocks, chains,
manacles, and fetters and chained one to another. It was thick with blinding
smoke, and they were stricken by unpleasant sickening air, breathing with
difficulty, tormented by hunger and thirst, and naked, without clothes, their
bodies entirely covered in dirt and dust, their bodies covered by their own
hair, their thighs tightly bound together; they were overwhelmed by a
sensation of the suffering of a series of various torments, and in their
suffering they cried out with unendurable wailing and screams.
41. 48
“When he saw this, a great compassion arose in him along with a
motivation to help others. He reassured them, saying, ‘I will free from prison
all those who have been placed in the darkness of this prison,’ thus giving
them the gift of freedom from fear.
41. 49
“He went to King Jayaprabha and said to him, ‘Your Majesty, I request
your attention. Taking pity on those beings who are in the unhappiness of
being imprisoned, I have given them the assurance of freedom from fear.
Please release them.’
41. 50
“King Jayaprabha gathered together his five hundred ministers and asked
them, ‘What do you think?’ [F.192.a]1669


---

“They said, ‘All these prisoners have stolen from the king’s treasuries,
have attempted to harm the king, have trespassed into your harem, and so
on. They should be executed. Their punishment should be execution or to die
in chains. Someone who undertakes to help them is committing a crime
against the king.’1670
41. 51
“Prince Vijitāvin, giving rise
 to an overwhelming compassion, said to
those ministers, ‘Let it be as you have just said. I will endure all their
experiences of suffering for their sake. Do to me whatever you would do to
them and set them free! I will undergo every kind of unhappiness in order to
free them from prison. I will even give up my body and life. Why is that? If I
am unable to free even these beings from prison, how would I be able to
liberate beings who are imprisoned in the three realms, who are bound by
the noose of craving, who are within the darkness of ignorance, who have
been cast into the darkness of stupidity, who are tormented by the suffering
of poverty, who are distressed in the deep abyss of the lower existences,
whose bodies have unpleasant shapes and ugly color, who are lacking in the
functioning of the senses, who have bewildered minds, who do not see a
way out of saṃsāra, who are devoid of light, who cling to the three realms,
who lack the accumulations of merit and wisdom, who are deprived of a
basis for wisdom, whose minds are stained by various kleśas, who are
trapped in an enclosure of suffering, who are under the power of Māra, and
who are tormented by birth, aging, sickness, death, misery, wailing,
suffering, unhappiness, and tribulation?’ [F.192.b]
1671
41. 52
“Prince Vijitāvin could not be dissuaded from freeing those imprisoned
beings by offering up himself, by offering everything, and by ransoming
them with his entourage and all his accumulation of wealth, and then taking
on the suffering of those beings.
41. 53
“Then the five hundred ministers, wailing with their arms upraised, went
to King Jayaprabha and said to him, ‘Your Majesty, we request attention.
Prince Vijitāvin’s plans will destroy the kingdom!
 We are even concerned
for our own lives! If Your Majesty does not restrain the prince, before long
Your Majesty’s life will be taken from you!’
1672
41. 54
“Then King Jayaprabha became angry and condemned to death Prince
Vijitāvin and all those people who were criminals.
41. 55
“When his birth mother heard this, she was distressed and, with her
entourage of a thousand women with their hair in disarray, their jewelry cast
aside, and their faces scratched, beating their breasts, with their heads
covered with dirt, and wailing with piteous cries, came into the presence of
the king, and she and her entourage bowed down at his feet and made this
supplication: ‘Your Majesty, listen to our plea! Free Prince Vijitāvin! Spare
the life of Prince Vijitāvin!’


---

41. 56
“Then the king had Prince Vijitāvin brought before him and said to him,
‘Prince, abandon those people who are criminals! If you do not abandon
them, you will be executed in their stead!’ [F.193.a]
41. 57
“The prince was not disheartened or discouraged but was engaged in
attaining the goal of omniscience, was dedicated to benefiting others, was
led in all his actions by compassion, and accepted his death.
41. 58
“His mother requested King Jayaprabha to give him half a month, saying,
‘I request that this prince be allowed to perform acts of charity for half a
month, and after that you may do as you wish.’
“The king gave his permission, saying, ‘Let it be so!’
41. 59
“The prince went to the great park called Sūrya prabha, which was to the
north of Rativyūhā, the royal capital, and was the traditional location for
offerings and acts of charity. There the prince gave anyone whatever they
wanted, making unconditional offerings and gifts of every kind for half a
month. He gave food to those who wanted food, gave drink to those who
wanted drink, and likewise gave steeds, clothes, flowers, powders,
ointments, Dharma robes, parasols, banners, flags, precious jewelry,
 all
ornaments, and every kind of necessity that was wished for.
1673
41. 60
“When the last day arrived, an assembly of many
 beings gathered. The
king’s ministers, the group of queens, the head merchants, the
householders, the people of the land, and the Jains assembled.
1674
41. 61
“The Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha-
pradīpa rāja, knowing it was the time to guide and ripen beings, also went to
the site of the distribution of gifts. A gathering of lords of the devas was his
entourage; lords of the nāgas made offerings to him; [F.193.b] lords of the
yakṣas were bowing to him; lords of the gandharvas were praising him;
lords of the asuras were bowing down to him; lords of the garuḍas, who
were adorned by crest jewels, were with delight strewing offerings; lords of
the kinnaras made offerings with joy and sang inspirational songs of praise;
and lords of the mahoragas encircled him, gazing at his face.
41. 62
“That great gathering of beings and Prince Vijitāvin saw, approaching
from afar, the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Dharma-
cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, who was handsome and delightful
to look at, with pacified senses and a pacified mind, withdrawn,
victorious over the senses, as tame as an elephant, as pure, clear, and
unpolluted as a lake, beautified by buddhahood’s emanations and great
miraculous manifestations and by the powerful supremacy of buddhahood,
and shining with the greatness of buddhahood. His body was beautifully
adorned by the adornments of the physical signs and features of a buddha,
and he was filling all worlds with the illumination of a buddha’s halo of
light, illuminating with a buddha’s light rays, emanating a field of the
1675


---

spreading aroma of precious perfumes from all his body’s pores, and
shaking all world realms in the manner of shaking buddha realms. He was
approaching while sending down a rain from a cloud of all adornments, with
the prowess of buddhahood, with the conduct of buddhahood that
eliminates kleśas within all beings, and through the sight of the buddha’s
face increasing the power of joy in all beings, [F.194.a] who on seeing the
tathāgata gained faith in their minds in the tathāgata.
41. 63
“Then Prince Vijitāvin and the great gathering of beings went to greet in
the distance the Bhagavat Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja,
and with faith in him they prostrated with their whole bodies, touching the
tops of their heads to his feet. They offered various kinds of offerings to him
and said, ‘Come, Bhagavat! Come, Sugata! Tathāgata, pay heed to us!
Tathāgata, take us into your care!’
41. 64
“Then Prince Vijitāvin prepared an excellent seat for the Bhagavat and
said to him, ‘Bhagavat, I request that you be seated upon this seat that has
been arranged for you.’
41. 65
“The Bhagavat approached it, and, through the blessing of the buddha,
the types of devas who were devoted to cleanliness of the body transformed
the seat so that it had in its center a lotus of the king of precious perfumes.
41. 66
“The Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha-
pradīpa rāja, sat upon that seat, and bodhisattvas sat upon the surrounding
seats. The beings of that assembly, as soon as they saw his face, became
freed from all obscurations; all their illnesses ceased, and they became
vessels for the Dharma of the āryas.
41. 67
“Then the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha-
pradīpa rāja, knowing that those beings had become ready vessels, gave the
teachings in stages. He taught the sūtra called The Illumination of the Field of
Causes. [F.194.b] He spoke through the entire ocean of the languages of
beings, definitions, and sounds of the voice, speaking with the thousands of
aspects of speech and possessing the thousands of aspects of the Dharma.
41. 68
“At that moment, eight hundred million beings within that assembly
became free of impurities, became stainless, and developed the Dharma
vision of the Dharma; many millions of beings attained the state beyond
training; and ten thousand beings were guided into the Mahāyāna. Thus
they entered into the way of completely good bodhisattva conduct and
accomplished great prayers.
41. 69
“When the Bhagavat this time turned the wheel of the Dharma through
the great miraculous powers of buddhahood, beings in the ten directions, as
numerous as the atoms in a hundred thousand buddha realms, were guided
into the Mahāyāna; beings without end or middle throughout the extent of


---

the various worlds and buddha realms were turned away from the lower
existences, and beings beyond number were brought onto the path to rebirth
in the higher existences.
41. 70
“Prince Vijitāvin also attained this bodhisattva liberation called the origin of
the roots of merit that inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the ripening of all
beings.1676
41. 71
“Noble one, at that time, in that time, there was the prince named Vijitāvin
who gave up his own body and life, his accumulation of wealth, his entire
entourage, and the happiness of living in the human world and freed those
beings who were in prison, [F.195.a] made an unrestricted great distribution
of gifts and offerings, honored the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak-
saṃbuddha Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, and, when he
saw the face of that tathāgata, developed the aspiration for the highest
complete enlightenment and attained this bodhisattva liberation called the
origin of the roots of merit that inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the
ripening of all beings. If you think he was anyone else, noble one, do not see
him in that way. At that time, in that time, I was the prince named Vijitāvin.
In that way, I was the prince named Vijitāvin, who became saddened
because of great compassion and who engaged in benefiting all beings
without any hope of not remaining in the three realms or of having a karmic
result in return; without any delight in fame, renown, or a great name;
without praise for oneself; without criticizing others; without attachment to
anything; having risen above the perceptions of existence; without
delighting in the three realms; while turning away from the pleasures of the
sensory field of the world, perceiving the field of the tathāgatas, having the
pure motivation of the bodhisattvas, having created the thunderbolt of the
superior motivation, and dedicated with great love to all beings; through
compassion
 for all beings undertaking the ending of suffering; with a
sincere focus on the strengths of the tathāgatas; and while training in the
path of the bodhisattvas, [F.195.b] adorning the path that brings forth the
displays of the Mahāyāna, and gazing upon the gateway
 into
omniscience, in that way accomplishing actions that are difficult
 to do.
1677
1678
1679
41. 72
“Noble one, that is how long it has been since I attained this bodhisattva
liberation called the origin of the roots of merit that inspire, in accordance with their
dispositions, the ripening of all beings.
41. 73
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that anyone else was at that
time, in that time, the five hundred ministers who made a perverse request to
King Jayaprabha and gave their counsel so that I would be executed, do not
see them in that way. They were the five hundred men sent by Devadatta to
assassinate the Bhagavat.


---

41. 74
“The Bhagavat has prophesied that they too will attain the highest,
complete enlightenment in a future time, after as many kalpas as there are
atoms in Sumeru, in a kalpa called Suprabha, as five hundred buddhas with
various qualities and displays of a buddha realm, born into various clans and
castes; with mothers and fathers with various names; manifesting various
miraculous births; with various miraculous settings forth into homelessness;
manifesting various lights from Bodhi trees; having various gateways into
going toward bodhimaṇḍas; manifesting various defeats of Māra;
manifesting various miraculous attainments of buddhahood; having various
ways of turning the Dharma wheel, of terms, and of definitions; teaching
various ways of the sūtras; teaching with various kinds of speech and voice;
having an array of various assemblies of followers; radiating the various
displays and powers
 of their halos of light; [F.196.a] having various
lifespans; having various blessings from their teachings; their teachings
having various objectives; having various names; and all having bodies of
great compassion.
1680
41. 75
“The first in that kalpa will be a tathāgata by the name of Mahākāruṇika,
who will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood in a
world realm called Ratnaprabhā. After him, in that same world, there will be
the second tathāgata called Sarva jagad dhita praṇidhāna candra. The third
tathāgata will be called Mahā karuṇā siṃha. The fourth tathāgata will be
called Sarva loka hitaiṣin. The last of them all will be a tathāgata called
Vaidyarāja.
41. 76
“Noble one, as for the men who were criminals at that time, in that time,
who had committed offenses against the king, and whom I freed from
imprisonment by going to the executioners and giving up my life and body,
if you think that they were anyone else, do not see them in that way. They
were the tathāgatas of the Bhadra kalpa, beginning with Krakucchanda, and
also countless millions
 of bodhisattvas, who upon seeing the Bhagavat,
the Tathāgata Ananta bala vighuṣṭa nirnādita śrī saṃbhava mati, developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment and are now practicing
bodhisattva conduct in the ten directions [F.196.b] and meditating and
increasing this bodhisattva liberation called the origin of the roots of merit that
inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the ripening of all beings.
1681
41. 77
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that King Jayaprabha at that
time, in that time, was anyone else, do not see him in that way. The great
teacher Satyaka was at that time, in that time, King Jayaprabha.
41. 78
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that King Jayaprabha’s
retinue of queens in the harem, the sentinels at the harem entrance, and his
court and attendants at that time, in that time, were anyone else, do not see
them in that way. They were these six thousand Jains whom Satyaka

brought before the Bhagavat, who came to debate against the Bhagavat so as
to possess the victory banner of teaching, and when they came, the
Bhagavat 
prophesied 
their 
attainment 
of 
the 
highest, 
complete
enlightenment, telling them that they would come into a world as tathāgatas
with the arrays of various realms, in various kalpas, and with various names.
41. 79
“Noble one, Prince Vijitāvin’s father and mother gave him permission, so
that after he freed those beings from prison, he cast aside the pleasure of
existence, the good fortune of wealth and precious treasuries, abandoned
children and wives, and entered mendicancy under the Bhagavat, the
Tathāgata Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja. After entering
mendicancy he maintained celibacy for five thousand years.
41. 80
“During that time he accomplished ten thousand gateways into samādhi,
[F.197.a] he attained ten thousand gateways into the power of mental
retention, he entered ten thousand ways of higher cognition, he attained ten
thousand bodhisattva treasures,
 he developed ten thousand powers of
omniscience, he purified ten thousand gateways into patience, he
accomplished ten thousand realizations through contemplation, he
multiplied ten thousand bodies with the strengths of a bodhisattva, he
entered ten thousand gateways into the knowledge of a bodhisattva, he
developed ten thousand ways of the perfection of wisdom, he perceived ten
thousand gateways for looking at the buddhas in the directions, and he
accomplished ten thousand bodhisattva prayers.
1682
41. 81
“Possessing such qualities in each instant of mind, he could arrive in ten
thousand buddha realms. In each world realm, in each instant of mind, he
could remember ten thousand past and future buddhas. He could see and
know ten thousand oceans of emanations from each of those buddhas going
into the ten directions.
41. 82
“In each instant of mind, he could see all the beings within those ten
thousand buddha realms. He knew their birth into various existences, their
passing away and their rebirths, their decline, their ascent, their going on the
path to happy existences, their going on the path to lower existences, their
having a beautiful color, and their having a bad color,
 exactly as they
were born.
1683
41. 83
“He saw the passing away and the rebirth of all those beings, and he saw
and knew their movements of mind, the conduct of their minds, the
continuation of their minds, their various thoughts, [F.197.b] their ocean of
faculties, the vast extent of their activities, the conclusion of their karma, and
the times for ripening and guiding them.
41. 84
“Noble one, when that prince passed away, he was reborn in the family of
that king in the royal capital, Rativyūhā, in that Jambudvīpa, and he
succeeded to the sovereignty of a cakravartin king. When he had become a

cakravartin king, following the parinirvāṇa of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata
Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, he honored the Tathāgata
by the name of Dharma gaganābhyudgata śrī rāja.
41. 85
“After that, he became a Śakra who at the bodhimaṇḍa honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Devendragarbha.
“After that, in that world realm he became a Suyāma king of devas who
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Dharaṇī śrī parvata tejas.
41. 86
“After that, in that world realm he became a Saṃtuṣita king of devas who
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Dharma cakra prabha nirghoṣa rāja.
“After that, in that world realm he became a Sunirmita king of devas who
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Gagana kānta rāja.
41. 87
“After that, in that world realm he became a Vaśavartin king of devas who
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Anavamarda bala ketu.
“After that, in that world realm he became an asura lord who honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Sarva dharma nigarjita rāja.
41. 88
“After that, in that world realm he became a Brahmā lord [F.198.a] who
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Dharma cakra nirmāṇa samanta-
pratibhāsa nirghoṣa.
41. 89
“Noble one, there were those and the rest of the ten thousand buddhas
who appeared in that world realm of Ratnaprabhā during the Suprabha
kalpa. Prince Vijitāvin honored all those tathāgatas.
41. 90
“Noble one, following that Suprabha kalpa arose the kalpa
 called
Suraśmi. During that Suraśmi kalpa there were ten thousand buddhas.

“In that kalpa, I became Mahāmati. During the time when I was King
Mahāmati, I honored the Tathāgata by the name of Lakṣaṇa śrī parvata.
41. 92
“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a householder and I honored
the Tathāgata by the name of Saṃvṛtaskandha.
“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a minister and I honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Vimala vatsa.
41. 93
“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was an asura lord and I honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Veśadhārin.
“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a tree goddess and I honored
the Tathāgata by the name of Lakṣaṇa sumeru.

“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a caravan leader and I honored
the Tathāgata by the name of Vimala bāhu.
“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a city goddess and I honored
the Tathāgata by the name of Siṃha vikrānta gāmin.
41. 95
“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a Vaiśravaṇa and I honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Devendracūḍa.

the Tathāgata by the name of Dharmodgata kīrti. [F.198.b]

“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a kumbhāṇḍa lord and I
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Avabhāsa makuṭin.
41. 97
“Noble one, in that way, I honored those ten tathāgatas and all the others.
I was reborn in various existences in the Suprabha kalpa and honored six
hundred million tathāgatas and made offerings to all those tathāgatas.
Whenever I came before each of those tathāgatas, I ripened realms of beings
without end or middle for the highest, complete enlightenment. Whenever I
came before each of those tathāgatas, I attained various entrances into
samādhis, various entrances into powers of mental retention, various ways
of accomplishments, various ways of accomplishing discernments, various
realizations of the ways of omniscience, various ways of attaining the
entrances to the illumination of the Dharma, various aspects of the analysis
that comprehends the ways of knowledge, various illuminations of entering
into the ocean of directions, and various illuminations of entering and
comprehending the various oceans of realms, and I attained various
illuminations of the perception that sees the ocean of tathāgatas. I overcame
them, purified them, perfected them, and remained in them. They were born,
they arose, they were increased, they were magnified, they arose perfectly,
and they arose completely.

“Just as I attended the tathāgatas in that Suprabha kalpa, during kalpas as
numerous as the atoms in all the ocean of world realms, however many
tathāgatas appeared, however many tathāgatas came from other world
realms, [F.199.a] from all those tathāgatas who taught the Dharma, I heard
the Dharma that they taught, and having heard it, I possessed it. I honored
all those tathāgatas and served them. I held the teaching of all those buddha
bhagavats. I obtained from all those tathāgatas various ways for the
attainment of this bodhisattva liberation called the origin of the roots of merit that
inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the ripening of all beings, and I
obtained various entrances into ways of liberation.”
41. 99
Then at that time, the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya-
prabhā, in order to describe and teach this liberation, recited these verses to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
41. 100
“You, friend,
 have asked me about
1685
This inconceivable supreme liberation.
I shall teach it through the blessing of the Sugata.
Listen to me properly and entirely. {12}
41. 101
“There was the beautiful world realm
Ratnaprabhā in the past beyond
Inconceivable, vast, endless kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of buddha realms. {13}

41. 102
“In that time, there arose the kalpa Suprabha
In which countless jinas appeared.
I honored those lords of munis
And meditated on this liberation. {14}
41. 103
“There was a vast, excellent royal capital,
And its name was Rativyūhā.
At that time, the minds of beings were impure,
And they had dreadfully bad conduct. {15}
41. 104
“In that time, there was King Jayaprabha,
Who governed those beings according to the Dharma.1686
His son, named Vijitāvin, was handsome [F.199.b]
And adorned by the signs of a great being. {16}
41. 105
“At that time, seeing that the king was executing
Those many thousands of criminals,
The prince was filled with compassion and sadness,
And he quickly beseeched the king to release them. {17}
41. 106
“When the king had heard him, he gathered together
All his ministers and spoke to them.
They all bowed down to him and said to him,
‘This is a plan to assassinate you, Your Majesty!’ {18}
41. 107
“The king, having this misunderstanding,
At that time ordered the execution of his son.
The prince was indifferent to the loss of his own life,
And he did not free himself from being executed. {19}
41. 108
“When his mother heard that he was to be executed,
With her entourage she supplicated the king,
Asking for permission for the prince to give to the world
All that he possessed for the duration of half a month. {20}
41. 109
“The king gave his permission for that to be done,
And the prince gave away whatever was wanted
For half a month, day and night, practicing generosity.
And on the last day, to a gathering of Jains {21}
41. 110
“He gave whatever they desired,
And having given to them he prepared for death.
A multitude of beings wailing and weeping
Gathered together at the royal capital. {22}

41. 111
“At that time, there sat at the foot of a Bodhi tree
The Sugata Saddharma ghoṣāmbara dīpa rāja.
That lord of beings knew it was time to ripen them,
And with great compassion he came to the place where gifts were given. {23}
41. 112
“The Tathāgata came to that gathering
Through his miraculous powers,
And the Sugata taught the king of sūtras,
The sound of the Dharma as a cloud of lamps of the Dharma. {24}
41. 113
“He guided beings without end or middle
And at that time gave prophecies of enlightenment.
The son of the king, Vijitāvin, was overjoyed
And entered upon attaining the supreme enlightenment. {25}
41. 114
“He offered to the Sugata vast honors and offerings, [F.200.a]
And with joy he said these words:
‘May I become for beings a sanctuary, a guide,
A protector, a refuge, and a defender.’ {26}
41. 115
“He became a mendicant under that muni
And sought the path to enlightenment.
He examined the nature of phenomena,
Remaining practicing in that way for a hundred kalpas. {27}
41. 116
“He had compassion for beings with no protector
Who were falling into an ocean of suffering,
And, meditating on the path to true enlightenment,
He attained at that time this liberation. {28}
41. 117
“He joyfully honored every one
Of the sugatas who appeared in that kalpa,
Making great offerings to all of them
And possessing their wheels of the Dharma. {29}
41. 118
“After that, during an ocean of kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in a sea of realms,
He made offerings, and he honored
However many jinas appeared. {30}
41. 119
“I was the one named Vijitāvin,
Who saw the prisoners in the dreadful prison,
Offered up his body in order to free them,
And at that time attained this liberation, {31}

41. 120
“Who meditated during a great ocean of kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms,
And who, in each instant, multiplied the ways
That were unequaled and vast, without end or middle. {32}
41. 121
“I have obtained this liberation
From as many lords of munis as I saw;
They taught me this liberation
Through various ways of entry. {33}
41. 122
“I trained for many millions of kalpas
In this unmistaken, inconceivable liberation I received from them.
Established in it by the jinas, I was liberated.
I simultaneously drank from their clouds of Dharma. {34}
41. 123
“My bodies pervaded without impediment
All the realms in all the ten directions.
In each instant, I entered countless realms [F.200.b]
And entered the divisions of the three times. {35}
41. 124
“They gaze upon each and every one without exception
In the ocean of the jinas in the three times.
They wander in the presence of the clouds
Of the visual images of their bodies. {36}
41. 125
“They go in every direction,
Going into the presence of the jinas.
They send down a rain of every beautiful display,
And they offer it to those jinas. {37}
41. 126
“They ask an endless number of all questions
To the immense, vast ocean of buddhas.
And they possess all, without exception, of the rain
That falls from the clouds of the Dharma of the jinas. {38}
41. 127
“They go into every direction without exception,
Arriving in the presence of the fields of the jinas.
They manifest a variety of a multitude of forms,
And they manifest a variety of miracles. {39}
41. 128
“They fill all directions with thousands of forms
With their physical bodies that have infinite colors.
They can manifest from the form of a single body
Infinite aspects, vast without end or middle. {40}

41. 129
“They radiate an ocean of innumerable
Light rays from each and every pore,
And through a variety of methods they extinguish
The pain from the fire of the kleśas within beings. {41}
41. 130
“While they remain in one place, clouds of emanated bodies
Are radiated from each and every pore,
Filling all directions with marvelous wonders
And guiding beings with the rain of the water of the Dharma. {42}
41. 131
“This way of entering is that of inconceivable form.
It is the support for all the progeny of the jinas.
Remaining in this, they practice the conduct
Within all realms until the last of future kalpas. {43}
41. 132
“They teach the Dharma in accordance with aspirations,
And they repel the nets that are wrong views.
They establish beings in the higher existences and nirvāṇa,
And they teach the level of omniscience. {44}
41. 133
“They teach the Dharma according to aspirations
With endless colors and countless bodies, [F.201.a]
With all kinds of birth and worlds without exception,
With bodies that are the images of the bodies of all beings. {45}
41. 134
“These and also a measureless ocean of other qualities,
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms
And beyond conception, are attained
By those who have this liberation, this peace. {46}
41. 135
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the origin of the roots
of merit that inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the ripening of all beings.
How could I know the conduct, or comprehend the ocean of qualities, or
understand the prowess of the knowledge, or ascertain the states of mind, or
realize the power of samādhi, or know completely the miraculous
manifestation of the liberations of bodhisattvas who have transcended all
the existences in worlds, who appear in the visual form of all births in
worlds, who have transcended all worldly knowledge, who are dedicated to
destroying the mountain of all obscurations of knowledge, who have
discerned the nature and characteristics of all phenomena, who are
dedicated to eliminating all the obscurations and darkness of the kleśas, who
are skilled in the accomplishment of the analysis of all phenomena, who
have the direct perception of the Dharma of there being no self, who are
continuously ripening and guiding beings, who have realized the way of

nonduality of the realm of the Dharma, and who have the intelligence to
follow the ocean of all the ways within the scope of speech?1687
41. 136
“Depart, noble one. In the forest of Lumbinī in this Jambudvīpa, there is
the goddess of the Lumbinī Forest called Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī. Go to her
[F.201.b] and ask her, ‘How are bodhisattvas born into the family of the
tathāgatas? How do bodhisattvas appear in the world? How do they
unwearyingly practice bodhisattva conduct until the last of all future
kalpas?’ ”
41. 137
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the two feet of the
night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā, circumambulated
the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā many hundreds
of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, with palms together,
looking back at her, departed from the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā-
praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā. [B13]
