Chapter 30
AVALOKITEŚVARA
30. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplating the instruction of
the householder Veṣṭhila, knowing that treasury of bodhisattva aspiration,
remembering that power of bodhisattva memory, keeping in his mind the
power of that successive lineage of the way of the buddhas, comprehending
the continuous succession of the lineage of the buddhas, remembering the
names of the buddhas that he had heard,
 being in accord with the way of
the Dharma taught by the buddhas, comprehending the array of attainments
through the Dharma
 of the buddhas, having confidence in the
proclamation
 of complete buddhahood by the buddhas, and focused on
the inconceivable activity of the tathāgatas, eventually came to the Potalaka
Mountain. [F.69.a] He ascended the Potalaka Mountain and searched and
searched for the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara.
1245
1246
1247
30. 2
He saw Avalokiteśvara on the upper slope
 of the western side of the
mountain. It was a fresh, gentle, verdant pasture like a circular area of blue
beryl and was beautified by springs, waterfalls, and streams,
 an open
grove within a great forest. He was teaching the Dharma, seated cross-
legged upon a diamond rock encircled by a countless assembly of
bodhisattvas seated upon rocks that were various jewels. He was giving the
Dharma teaching called The Clear Teaching of the Gateway to Love and
Compassion, which has as its scope the gathering of all beings into the
Dharma.
1248
1249
30. 3
On seeing him, Sudhana was filled with joy, delighted, elated, pleased,
and happy. With increasing rapture, he kept his eyes wide open. He placed
his hands together in homage. His mind was at peace through being
endowed with the power of faith in kalyāṇamitras. He believed that to see
kalyāṇamitras was to see all the buddhas. He believed that the acquisition of
the entire cloud of Dharma originated from the kalyāṇamitras. He believed
that all qualities and practices depended on the kalyāṇamitras. He believed


---

that it was difficult to encounter kalyāṇamitras. He believed that the
attainment of the precious wisdom of the ten strengths came from the
kalyāṇamitras. He believed that the inexhaustible light of wisdom
 came
from the kalyāṇamitras. He believed that the continuous increase of merit
was dependent on the kalyāṇamitras. He believed that the gateway to
omniscience was revealed by the kalyāṇamitras. [F.69.b] He believed that
entry into the great ocean of wisdom was taught by the kalyāṇamitras. He
believed that the gathering of the accumulation of omniscience was born
from the kalyāṇamitras.
1250
30. 4
He went toward the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. The bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara could see Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, coming in the
distance and said, “Come here! You are welcome,
 you who have entered
the inconceivable, vast Mahāyāna, which is beyond any analogy; you who
have the motivation to be a refuge for all beings who are tormented by
various sufferings that arise through being born and who have no refuge;
you who wish to witness all the Dharmas of the buddhas, which transcend
the world, are beyond analogy, and are beyond measure; you who are filled
with the power
 of great compassion and intend to liberate all beings; you
in whom the completely good conduct is evidently seen; you who aspire to
make pure a domain of great prayers; you who wish to possess the clouds of
Dharma of all the buddhas; you whose motivation to accumulate roots of
merit is never satisfied; you who follow perfectly the instructions of
kalyāṇamitras; you who are the source of a lotus
 of good qualities, arising
from the ocean of the wisdom of Mañjuśrī; you who are focused on attaining
the blessing of the buddhas; you who have attained the light and power of
samādhi; you who aspire to obtain the rain
 from the clouds of Dharma of
all the buddhas; you whose mind is made happy by the power of faith and
delight on seeing the buddhas; [F.70.a] you whose mind is moistened by the
power of immeasurable, inconceivable conduct; you who have become the
lord of a treasure of pure merit and wisdom through the power of the
practice of good qualities; you who are motivated to teach others the power
of the path to seeing omniscient wisdom; you who possess the root that is
the undiminishing power of great compassion; you who are intent on
possessing the power of the light of the wisdom of the tathāgatas.”
1251
1252
1253
1254
30. 5
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara. He bowed his head to the feet of the bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara. He circumambulated the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right. Then he stood
before him and, with his hands placed together in homage, said, “Ārya, I


---

have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I
do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in
what way they should practice it.
30. 6
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
30. 7
Then the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara extended his right hand, which was
the color of gold from the Jambu River and emanated a display of clouds of
countless networks of lights of various colors, and upon Sudhana’s head he
placed his hand, which had the multicolored light rays that shine from the
signs and features of a great being and bring stainless, measureless physical
and mental bliss. [F.70.b]
30. 8
The bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara said, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent,
that you have in that way developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment!
30. 9
“Noble one, I know the gateway to bodhisattva activity called the
unimpeded gateway to great compassion.
30. 10
“Noble one, my gateway to bodhisattva activity called the unimpeded
gateway to great compassion ripens and guides beings without making any
distinctions among all beings, and it gathers and guides beings through
their completely hearing and knowing this gateway.
30. 11
“Noble one, in that way, being established in the gateway to bodhisattva
activity called the unimpeded gateway to great compassion, though I never depart
from being at the feet of all the tathāgatas, I remain focused on what should
be done for all beings. I gather beings through generosity. I gather beings
through pleasant words, through benefiting them, and through practicing
what I teach.
30. 12
“I also ripen beings through manifesting physical bodies. I gladden and
ripen beings through manifesting countless pure
 colors, shapes, and
forms and through radiating a net of light rays. I speak to them in
accordance with their aspirations. I manifest whatever path of conduct they
delight in. I teach them the Dharma in accordance with their various wishes.
I manifest various forms of miracles so as to inspire beings who have not
been attentive in accumulating virtuous qualities. I manifest a variety of
countless emanations in accordance with their wishes. I gather and ripen
beings by manifesting forms that accord with the states of the beings born in
the various classes of existence [F.71.a] and by living with them in the same
place.
1255
30. 13
“Noble one, in that way I have purified the gateway to bodhisattva activity
called the unimpeded gateway to great compassion and therefore prayed to be a
support for all beings. I have accomplished the prayer to be a support for all


---

beings in order that I end for all beings the fear of precipices, cause fears
within all beings to cease, eliminate fear from confusion in all beings,
eliminate in all beings the fear of being in bondage, dispel in all beings the
fear of circumstances
 that cause loss of life, banish from all beings the
fear of being deprived of material necessities, end in all beings the fear of
being without a livelihood, dispel in all beings the fear of ill repute,
 dispel
in all beings the fear of being in saṃsāra, cause the fear of timidity within an
assembly to cease in all beings, cause all beings to transcend the fear of
death, dispel in all beings the fear of the lower existences, shine the light of
irreversibility upon those whose path has degenerated in great
 darkness,
completely eliminate in all beings the fear of meeting misfortune, extinguish
in all beings the fear of being apart from what is liked, eliminate in all beings
the fear of having to be with what is disliked, separate all beings from the
fear of physical torment, free all beings from mental torment, [F.71.b] and
cause all beings to transcend suffering, unhappiness, and disturbances.
1256
1257
1258
1259
30. 14
“I manifest the gateway to mindfulness in all worlds in order to dispel fear
in all beings. I have made the wheel of my name known in all worlds in order
to free all beings from fear. I miraculously manifest my body to be the
same
 as the distinct forms of all endless beings in order to be perceived
by beings at the appropriate times.
1260
30. 15
“Noble one, through this method, I liberate all beings from fear and cause
them to develop an irreversible aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment so that they will attain all the Dharmas of the buddhas.
30. 16
“Noble one, I know this gateway to bodhisattva activity called the
unimpeded gateway to great compassion, but how could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of the completely good bodhisattvas who have the
pure domain of the prayers of all buddhas; who have realized the completely
good conduct of bodhisattvas; who have an unbroken continuity of creating
virtuous qualities; who are always resting in a continuity of the samādhi of
all bodhisattvas; who have nonregressing conduct while residing in all
kalpas; who have the continuous understanding of the ways of all three
times; who are skilled in the continuity of the turning of the cycle of all world
realms; who have the continuity of ending nonvirtuous mentalities in all
beings; who have a continuity of increasing the virtuous mentalities of all
beings; [F.72.a] and who have the continuity of countering the continuity of
saṃsāra for all beings?”
30. 17
Concerning this it is said:
Sudhana, who was self-disciplined, circumambulated,
Praised reverently, and departed on the southern road —
He saw, residing in a cleft in a precious mountain,


---

Avalokiteśvara, a ṛṣi who abided in compassion. {1}
30. 18
The wise one was seated in the center of a lotus on a lion throne
On the side
 of the diamond mountain with various precious jewels.
1261
He was teaching the Dharma to the devas, asuras, nāgas,1262
Kinnaras, rākṣasas, and bodhisattvas who encircled him. {2}
30. 19
When Sudhana saw him, he was filled with unequaled joy,
Approached him, and bowed down to the feet of the ocean of qualities.
He said, “Ārya, have compassion and teach to me the training
So that I may attain good conduct.” {3}
30. 20
Extending his stainless hand, adorned by a hundred merits,
Which emitted excellent, vast networks of clouds of light,
And placing it upon Sudhana’s head, that pure being,
The wise one Avalokiteśvara, spoke these words: {4}
30. 21
“Son of the buddhas, I know one gateway to liberation,
Which is the mass of compassion, the essence of wisdom of all the jinas,
Which arises in order to gather and liberate all beings,
And my love for them thus courses everywhere. {5}
30. 22
“I protect all beings from every suffering.
Those who are tightly bound, who are in the hands of enemies,
Whose bodies are struck, and who are put into prisons
On hearing my name are freed from bondage. {6}
30. 23
“Those who have broken the law will escape execution
When at that time they remember my name.
Arrows that are fired will not hit their bodies.
Weapons that strike them will be not pierce them. {7} [F.72.b]
30. 24
“Those who remember my name will be invincible.
Though they enter the courts of lords, no matter who disputes with them,
They will be victorious over all adversaries and attain excellence,1263
And their fame, friends, families, and wealth will increase. {8}
30. 25
“Anyone who remembers my name
Entering forests fearful with thieves, fearful with enemies,
With lions, bears, leopards, wild beasts, yaks, and snakes,
Will be free of fear and victorious over enemies. {9}
30. 26
“When anyone who remembers my name
Is malevolently thrown from the summit of a great mountain1264
Or hurled into a blazing fire of coals,


---

The fire will transform into a treasure of water filled with lotuses. {10}
30. 27
“Anyone who instantly remembers my name
When thrown into the sea will not die there.
They will not be swept away by rivers or burn in the midst of fire.
In everything they will not fail but will be successful. {11}
30. 28
“Those who remember my name will attain liberation
From stocks, chains, manacles, and unjust punishments;
Dishonor, disrespect, constraints, and deception;
Abuse, beatings, threats, and scolding. {12}
30. 29
“All those who are hostile and seek to harm,
Who are always angry and speak unpleasant words,
Will become friendly the moment they see
Those who have heard and remember my name and will praise them. {13}
30. 30
“Anyone who remembers my name
Will always overpower those enemies
Who, in order to harm, practice vetāla mantras and sorcery,
And they will not be harmed by any poison. {14}
30. 31
“Those who have remembered my name will pacify
All nāga lords, hordes of rākṣasas, garuḍas, piśācas,
Kumbhāndas, and pūtanas who with wrathful minds cause harm,
Who steal vitality, and who terrify in dreams. {15}
30. 32
“Those who remember my name for a moment
Will not become separated from parents, friends, and relatives, [F.73.a]
And will not be in the company of those who dislike them;
Their wealth will not be exhausted, and they will not become poor. {16}
30. 33
“Anyone who remembers my name
Will not go to the Avīci hell when they die
But will be reborn as a good being, a deva or human,
And not as an animal or a preta, or in an unfortunate existence. {17}
30. 34
“Those who remember my name will become humans
Who are not blind, one-eyed, deaf, unable to walk,
Or with a limp, but who speak clearly and have a pleasant appearance,
And they will possess all faculties for many millions of kalpas. {18}
30. 35
{19}1265
30. 36
“Anyone who remembers my name


---

Will be a pure being who on passing away will be reborn
In the presence of buddhas in world realms in the ten directions,
Will see the buddhas, and will hear their Dharma. {20}
30. 37
“These and all my many other methods
For guiding beings in worlds are endless and innumerable.
Son of the buddhas, I meditate on this one liberation,
But I do not know all the qualities of those with qualities.” {21}
30. 38
{22}1266
30. 39
At that time the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin came from the east through the
sky and resided on a peak of the Cakravāla mountain range in the Sahā
world realm. The moment that the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin’s feet landed
on a peak of the Cakravāla mountain range in the Sahā world realm, the Sahā
world realm shook in six ways and transformed into being composed of
many jewels.
30. 40
The bodhisattva Ananyagāmin outshone the light of the sun and moon.
The light from his body outshone devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras,
garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, Śakra, Brahmā, the world guardians, fire,
jewels, lightning, and starlight. [F.73.b]
30. 41
He even illuminated the great hells. He illuminated all dark existences in
the realm of animals and the world of Yama. He caused all the sufferings in
the lower existences to instantly cease. All beings ceased to be tormented by
the kleśas. Various kinds of misery, pain, and suffering were alleviated. Rain
from clouds of jewels fell over all of this buddha realm, and there also fell
rain from clouds of a variety of offerings, the entire display of flowers,
perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, powders, clothing, parasols,
banners, and flags.
30. 42
He then went to where the Bhagavat was, and the image of his body
appeared in the residences of all beings, appearing so as to satisfy them in
accordance with their wishes. He also appeared to come before the
bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara.
30. 43
Then the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara said to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, “Noble one, did you see the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin
coming to the gathering of this assembly?
30. 44
“Depart, noble one. Go to the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin and ask him,
‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
30. 45
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bodhisattva 
Avalokiteśvara, 
circumambulated 
the 
bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his
right, and, looking back again and again, departed from the bodhisattva

Avalokiteśvara. [F.74.a]
