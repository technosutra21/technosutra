SUMMARY
s. 1
In this lengthy final chapter of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, while the Buddha
Śākyamuni is in meditation in Śrāvastī, Mañjuśrī leaves for South India,
where he meets the young layman Sudhana and instructs him to go to a
certain kalyāṇamitra or “good friend,” who then directs Sudhana to another
such friend. In this way, Sudhana successively meets and receives teachings
from fifty male and female, child and adult, human and divine, and monastic
and lay kalyāṇamitras, including night goddesses surrounding the Buddha
and the Buddha’s wife and mother. The final three in the succession of
kalyāṇamitras are the three bodhisattvas Maitreya, Mañjuśrī, and Samanta-
bhadra. Samanta bhadra’s recitation of the Samanta bhadra caryā praṇidhāna (“The
Prayer for Completely Good Conduct”) concludes the sūtra.

INTRODUCTION
i. 1
The Stem Array (Gaṇḍa vyūha) is a unique sūtra in that most of its narrative
takes place in South India, far from the presence of the Buddha. It follows the
journey of the young Sudhana from teacher to teacher, or kalyāṇamitra
(literally “good friend”), beginning with his meeting Mañjuśrī when that
bodhisattva came to South India. Another unique characteristic is that
Sudhana’s teachers include children, non-Buddhists, a courtesan, merchants,
and so on, among them a number of women. His teachers are both humans
and deities, including eight night goddesses around the Bodhi tree and the
forest goddess of Lumbinī, the birthplace of the Buddha. These teachers are
often described as having received teachings from numerous other buddhas.
For example, the bhikṣu Sāgara megha describes how he received, from a
buddha who appeared out of the ocean, teachings that would take more
than a kalpa to write out. The kalyāṇamitras are described as having
realizations and miraculous powers that test the limits of the imagination.
i. 2
The Gaṇḍa vyūha forms the forty-fifth and final chapter of the
Buddhāvataṃsaka (A Multitude of Buddhas) Sūtra, where it is called a “chapter”
rather than a “sūtra.” According to the Degé colophon, the previous forty-
four chapters form six sections, or sūtras, of the Avataṃsaka, with the Gaṇḍa-
vyūha as the seventh sūtra.  In his sixteenth-century survey of the major
sūtras, Pekar Zangpo (pad dkar bzang po) divides the first group of chapters
into two, so that the Gaṇḍa vyūha is the eighth section of the Buddhāvataṃsaka.
The Gaṇḍa vyūha is one of the four sections that consist of a single sūtra, but it
is by far the longest sūtra or chapter, comprising about a third of the
Avataṃsaka Sūtra.

i. 3
In the Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra, the Buddha Śākyamuni never speaks: all the
teachings in the forty-five chapters of the Avataṃsaka are given by others. In
the first forty-four chapters or sūtras this is done in the Buddha’s presence.
The Gaṇḍa vyūha is unique in that most of this lengthy chapter takes place far
from his presence, with other buddhas being presented as the sources of


---

teachings received by the kalyāṇamitras whom Sudhana meets. However,
the previous chapters of the Avataṃsaka have already presented the view that
various buddhas are manifestations of the Buddha Vairocana, and it is by the
name Vairocana that Śākyamuni is referred to in this sūtra.3
i. 4
The previous forty-four chapters of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra take place during
the two weeks after the Buddha’s enlightenment, at which time he sits in
silence under the Bodhi tree yet is simultaneously present, still in silent
meditation, in other locations throughout our universe: the Trāyastriṃśa
paradise of Indra on the summit of Sumeru, the Yāma and Tuṣita paradises
high above Sumeru, and the highest paradise in the realm of desire —the
Para nirmita vaśa vartin paradise. Bodhisattvas congregate around him,
inspired by his presence to give such teachings as the Daśa bhūmika Sūtra (Ten
Bhūmi Sūtra),  which is taught by the bodhisattva Vajragarbha in the Para-
nirmita vaśa vartin paradise. The Daśa bhūmika Sūtra had a great influence on
the development of Buddhism, eclipsing the previous seven bhūmis of the
Prajñāpāramitā (Perfection of Wisdom) sūtras.
4
i. 5
The Gaṇḍa vyūha, on the other hand, begins with the Buddha in silent
meditation in his Jetavana Monastery in Śrāvastī, where he spent most of his
summer retreats. Human pupils are gathered around him along with a
multitude of bodhisattvas that his human pupils are not advanced enough to
perceive. While the Buddha sits silently in meditation, the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra gives a teaching to the assembled bodhisattvas. The
bodhisattva Mañjuśrī leaves the assembly for South India, and, rather than
continuing to describe events and teachings in the presence of the Buddha,
the sūtra follows Mañjuśrī to South India, where he meets Sudhana, and the
narrative then follows Sudhana for the rest of the long sūtra. Although the
beginning of the sūtra is set at a time later than that of the Buddha’s
enlightenment, further on, in the night-goddess chapters, the Buddha is
depicted as being present under the Bodhi tree. There are other temporal
anomalies: the bodhisattva Maitreya, in the chapter where Sudhana meets
him, is portrayed as being on earth and not yet passed away to be reborn in
Tuṣita, even though he is said in the Māyādevī chapter, as is generally said
in other Buddhist sources, to be already present in Tuṣita. Māyādevī, the
Buddha’s mother, appears to Sudhana in Kapilavastu, the Buddha’s
hometown, even though she is traditionally said to have passed away
shortly after the Buddha’s birth and been reborn as a male deity in the
Trāyastriṃśa paradise.
i. 6
The sūtra primarily describes (in successive long compounds in Sanskrit)
both the inner qualities and the external displays of miraculous powers that
have been attained by the various kalyāṇamitras whom Sudhana meets. It


---

concludes with the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra composing the Samanta-
bhadra caryā praṇidhāna (“The Prayer for Completely Good Conduct”), which is
regularly recited by contemporary Tibetan Buddhists.
· Indian Origins of the Sūtra ·
i. 7
Mahāyāna sūtras first appeared through the medium of revelations after the
tradition of written sūtras had developed. These sūtras appeared in various
Buddhist traditions and in various locations.  Mahāyāna sources show
doctrinal similarities to the Mahāsāṃghika tradition.  The Mahāsāṃghika
was especially prevalent in southwest India, and a substantial number of
Mahāyāna sūtras have indications of a South Indian provenance, with
passing references to South Indian music, or, to take the Samādhirāja Sūtra  as
just one example, to a prominent South Indian personage, in this case the ṛṣi
Ananta. Similarly, much of the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra takes place in South India,
depicting teachers who appear to operate independently of Buddhist
communities in the north. Douglas Osto echoes Qobad Afshar in suggesting
that the site of Dhanyākara referenced in the Gaṇḍa vyūha is in fact
Dhānyakaṭaka/Dharaṇi koṭa, an ancient city that existed on the banks of the
Kṛṣṇa River in the southern region of Andhra. This place, Afshar and Osto
believe, was probably where the Gaṇḍa vyūha was first composed.

i. 8
In terms of its language, the Sanskrit of the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra has
numerous nonclassical Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS) features and
vocabulary. This is especially true of the verses, which are less prone to
revision to Classical Sanskrit than the prose. It is frequently the case that the
verses in a sūtra are older than the prose that accompanies them, or they at
least retain the original form of the language in which the sūtra was
composed. In the Gaṇḍa vyūha, they favor the -u ending for the nominative
case, where it would be -a in Sanskrit, -e in the ancient northeastern dialect,
and -o in that of the northwest (and its continuation in Pali). The difference
between these two kinds of Sanskrit is not evident in the Tibetan or the
English translations.
i. 9
Concerning the relative chronology of the Gaṇḍa vyūha, chapter 41 makes a
clear reference to the Satyaka Sūtra (formally known as The Teaching of the
Miraculous Manifestation of the Range of Methods in the Field of Activity of the
Bodhisattvas),  which describes a Jain master by the name of Satyaka, who
advises a king on the polity of rulership  and is eventually revealed by the
Buddha to be a bodhisattva who takes on various forms in order to benefit
beings.  The Satyaka Sūtra briefly presents the single-yāna view that was
expounded in The Lotus Sūtra,  but it goes further by stating that all religious
traditions in India occur through the blessing of the Buddha and are
9

---

therefore included within the single yāna.  This view of the Satyaka Sūtra is
crucial for understanding one of the surprising elements in the Gaṇḍa vyūha
Sūtra —some of Sudhana’s teachers do not appear to be following a Buddhist
path. There is the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa, who is teaching young brahmins;
and Jayoṣmāyatana, who is following the non-Buddhist ascetic practice of
“the five heats” (sitting amid four fires under the noonday sun); and there is
even Mahādeva, also known as Śiva. Therefore, in terms of the succession of
sūtras, it would appear that the Gaṇḍa vyūha postdates both The Lotus Sūtra
(though not necessarily its later chapters) and the Satyaka Sūtra.
13
i. 10
The depiction of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara in the Gaṇḍa vyūha is
surprising in that he is presented as an apparently human guru living on the
Potalaka Mountain in South India, with no mention of his association with
Amitābha’s pure realm of Sukhāvatī, where earlier sūtras locate him. The
Potalaka Mountain was an important place of pilgrimage for both the
Buddhists and Śaivites of South India, as the abode of both Śiva, who was
known as Lokeśvara (Lord of the World), and Avalokiteśvara. This earthly
abode of Avalokiteśvara, in Tibet known as the Potala Mountain, would
become prominent in Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism, as evidenced by the
Potala Palace in Lhasa and Mount Putuo Island in China.
i. 11
The Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra first existed in India as an independent sūtra and
still exists as an independent sūtra in Sanskrit manuscripts. The successive
Chinese translations reveal a gradual growth in the contents of the sūtra,
with the addition of more teachers in the Indian version before its eventual
translation into Tibetan. Even so, the number of kalyāṇamitras met by
Sudhana is still smaller than the number that Maitreya, toward the end of the
sūtra, proclaims that Sudhana has met on his journeys —110.
i. 12
There was an Indian version longer than the one that was translated into
Tibetan, though no Sanskrit manuscript of this version has survived. It is
known only from the version sent to China by the king of Orissa, who gave a
copy to the Chinese emperor in 795.  This version was translated by the
Kashmiri monk Prajñā in 798, two or three decades before the Tibetan
translation was made. The Chinese translations also indicate that the Gaṇḍa-
vyūha had a different title in the seventh century, which can be reconstructed
from the Chinese ⼊法界品 (Ru fa jie pin) as Dharma dhātu praveśana (Entry into
the Realm of the Dharma).
14
i. 13
Earlier versions concluded with the Maitreya chapter. The Mañjuśrī and
Samanta bhadra chapters were added subsequently, and finally the sixty-
two-verse “Prayer for Completely Good Conduct,” which has continued to
exist as an independent text, was added as the sūtra’s conclusion. This
prayer was translated into Chinese in a forty-four-verse version by
Buddhabhadra in the early fifth century. Amoghavajra’s (705–74) eighth-


---

century Chinese translation of the prayer has sixty-two verses because of the
addition of fifteen verses on Amitābha. This longer version appeared as the
conclusion of the Buddhāvataṃsaka in the translation into Chinese made in
798 and in the early ninth-century translation into Tibetan. “The Prayer for
Completely Good Conduct,” particularly its first twelve verses, is regularly
recited in Tibetan Buddhism, and it also exists independently in the Kangyur
with an additional concluding verse.15
i. 14
There are no surviving Sanskrit manuscripts of the Gaṇḍa vyūha from the
first millennium, but there is a complete Sanskrit text that dates to 1166 ᴄᴇ,
three hundred years later than the Tibetan translation. It consists of 289
palm-leaf pages and was sent from Nepal to the Royal Asiatic Society in
London by Brian Houghton Hodgson (1800–1894) in the early nineteenth
century. Cataloged as Hodgson 2 (A), this is the earliest extant Sanskrit
manuscript of the Gaṇḍa vyūha.  The Sanskrit Buddhist tradition has
continued in Nepal, where the Gaṇḍa vyūha remains one of the nine central
works of Newar Buddhism.
16
17
· The Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra in China ·
i. 15
The Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra was first translated into Chinese as an independent
text by a monk named Shengjian sometime between 388 and 408 ᴄᴇ.  In that
translation there are only twenty-five kalyāṇamitras. Compared to the extant
Sanskrit version, the first nine kalyāṇamitras after Mañjuśrī and those after
the thirty-fourth are not present.  Therefore, it may represent an unfinished
translation or an earlier form of the sūtra, or both.
18
19
i. 16
Not long afterward, in 420, Buddhabhadra (359–429 ᴄᴇ), an Indian monk
who had migrated to China, translated with his team the entire
Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra, which at that time was composed of thirty-four
chapters with the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra as the final chapter.  Buddhabhadra’s
translation contains not only additional chapters when compared to
Shengjian’s translation, but also additional verses and passages within the
chapters.
20
i. 17
Interestingly, the Indian monk Paramārtha (499–569 ᴄᴇ), who flourished
not long after Buddhabhadra’s time, refers to the Buddhāvataṃsaka as a
Bodhisattva piṭaka (“basket” or “collected teachings for bodhisattvas”). This is
echoed by a copy of this sūtra found in the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang,
which bears the title Bodhisattva piṭaka Buddhāvataṃsaka.  While the presently
available Sanskrit does not give the title Bodhisattva piṭaka, the Tibetan
colophons feature this designation, though the sense of it shifts depending
on the given colophon’s grammar,  which may suggest that there was some
confusion among Tibetan scholars about the term’s significance.
21
22


---

i. 18
The Buddhāvataṃsaka had grown even further in size by the time of its
translation into Chinese under the direction of the Khotanese Śikṣānanda (于
闐國實叉難陀, 652–710 ᴄᴇ). This was made between 695 and 699 ᴄᴇ and had
an additional five chapters, with the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra still in final place as
the thirty-ninth chapter. The translation of the Gaṇḍa vyūha in this version
varies little from that of Buddhabhadra, with a few exceptions: the final two
verses of the Veṣṭhila section have been added, Avalokiteśvara’s mountain is
now named Potalaka rather than Prabha, and a short verse greeting appears
in the final section.
23
24
i. 19
Śikṣānanda’s version of the Buddhāvataṃsaka became the basis for the
Huayan school of Chinese Buddhism, huayan being the Chinese translation
of avataṃsaka as “flower garland,” and it is Śikṣānanda’s version that was
translated by Thomas Cleary into English as The Flower Ornament Scripture.
In Śikṣānanda’s Chinese, the title of the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra was ⼊法界品 (Ru fa
jie pin), which could have come from the Sanskrit Dharma dhātu praveśana-
parivarta and in English could be translated as The Chapter on Entering the
Realm of the Dharma. Thomas Cleary translated this as Entry into the Realm of
Reality, while Douglas Osto translated it as Entry into the Realm of Dharma, and
Patrick Carré as l’Entrée dans la dimension absolue (Entry into the Absolute
Dimension).” The term dharma dhātu praveśana does occur in the text, as for
example in verse 44 of chapter 1.
25
i. 20
There is a longer version of the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra that was translated into
Chinese as an independent sūtra in 798 by the Kashmiri monk Prajñā. This
was the first among the Chinese translations to include “The Prayer for
Completely Good Conduct.”  Prajñā’s translation was based on a Sanskrit
manuscript that the king of Orissa sent as a gift to the Chinese emperor, who
received it in 795.  The additions in Prajñā’s version are not found in any
surviving Sanskrit edition, nor are they found in the early ninth-century
Tibetan translation made just a few decades after Prajñā’s translation. In
Prajñā’s translation the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra is called The Vow Concerning the
Course of Conduct of Samanta bhadra and the Entry into the Range of Inconceivable
Liberation (⼊不思議解脫境界普賢⾏願品, Ru bu si yi jie tuo jing jie pu xian xing
yuan pin), which could be reconstructed in Sanskrit as Acintya vimokṣa gocara-
praveśana samanta bhadra caryā pranidhāna).
26
27
i. 21
As mentioned, the Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra became the basis for the Chinese
Huayan school of Buddhism. Li Tongxuan (635–730 ᴄᴇ) was particularly
influential in the spread of this tradition, and he wrote a commentary (華嚴
論, Huayan lun) on the Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra, in which he identifies a deeper
structure and meaning in the Gaṇḍa vyūha’s narrative, and that part of Li
Tongxuan’s commentary has been translated into French by Patrick Carré. Li
also composed a summary of that commentary and a chapter-by-chapter


---

synopsis of the Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra itself.  This tradition spread to Korea
and Japan, where it became, respectively, the Hwaeom and Kegon schools
of Buddhism.
28
· Gaṇḍa vyūha and Borobudur ·
i. 22
The Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra, and in particular its Maitreya chapter, was an
inspiration for what is arguably the greatest Buddhist monument ever built:
Borobudur in Indonesia. This was built in the ninth century by the Buddhist
kings of the Śailendra dynasty in Java. The massive structure has a series of
encircling terraces that hold 504 statues and 2672 carved panels. The upper
terraces, the third and fourth galleries, are entirely dedicated to the Gaṇḍa-
vyūha, with 460 panels illustrating the sūtra.  Of these, it appears that 218
panels are dedicated to the Maitreya chapter, and from among those twenty
are dedicated to the description of Maitreya’s kūṭāgāra and thirty-five to the
various manifestations of Maitreya.  In fact, 334 panels are dedicated to the
conclusion of the Gaṇḍa vyūha: Maitreya, the brief return to Mañjuśrī,
Samanta bhadra, and the “Prayer of Good Conduct.” This reflects the
importance of the Gaṇḍa vyūha and particularly of Maitreya’s kūṭāgāra —an
edifice that embodied enlightenment —for the constructors of Borobudur,
who were also trying to create an edifice that embodied enlightenment.
29
30
i. 23
Although the number of accounts of Sudhana meeting kalyāṇamitras grew
in succeeding recensions, they did not reach the number given in the sūtra
itself in chapter 54, where Maitreya states that Sudhana, following his initial
meeting with Mañjuśrī, has visited 110 kalyāṇamitras. Borobudur, possibly
to accord with that statement, does have that number of panels dedicated to
the illustration of that part of the Gaṇḍa vyūha, but even so it does not
represent 110 kalyāṇamitras but instead repeats the illustration of certain
visits, in addition to portraying Sudhana traveling and depicting incidents in
past lives of the kalyāṇamitras.31
· The Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra in Tibet ·
i. 24
The Buddhāvataṃsaka as translated into Tibetan is composed of forty-five
chapters and 115 fascicles, with the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra still retaining its
position as the last of the chapters. According to the Degé Kangyur, the
entire Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra, including the Gaṇḍa vyūha, was translated into
Tibetan by Yeshé Dé, Jinamitra, and Surendrabodhi, which would have been
during the reign of King Senalek (r. ca. 800/804–15) or King Ralpachen (r.
815–36). Yeshé Dé and Jinamitra had been working at Samyé Monastery
since the reign of King Trisong Detsen (r. 742–98), but Surendrabodhi


---

appears to have come to Tibet after Senalek, Trisong Detsen’s youngest son,
became king. Senalek was in turn succeeded by his son Ralpachen, the end
of whose reign also saw the end of state-sponsored translation. Therefore,
this translation appears to have been made sometime between 800 and 836,
but it may incorporate even earlier translation work, particularly in the case
of the Gaṇḍa vyūha.
i. 25
By the time of the sūtra’s translation into Tibetan at the beginning of the
ninth century, the number of chapters in the Avataṃsaka Sūtra had increased
from thirty-nine to forty-five. But this is primarily because of the division in
Tibetan of what is the Chinese chapter 5 into chapters 5 through 9, with
some additional material, and the additional chapters 11 and 32. This Tibetan
translation provides the earliest indication of when the forty-fifth chapter
was named Gaṇḍa vyūha.
i. 26
According to Tashi Wangchuk, who wrote the colophon to the eighteenth-
century Degé edition, and also according to the historian Ngorchen Könchok
Lhundrup (1497–1557), the Buddhāvataṃsaka is composed of seven sūtras or
sections, while Pekar Zangpo divides the first of these into two, making
eight sections.
i. 27
Whereas the Chinese version of the Buddhāvataṃsaka retained the
traditional beginning of the Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra as an independent sūtra,
commencing with “Thus did I hear…” and so on, the version translated into
Tibetan omits it, as do the surviving Sanskrit versions.
i. 28
The Gaṇḍa vyūha Sūtra, which in Tibetan is interpreted to mean,
ambiguously, The Stem Array Sūtra, is the forty-fifth and last chapter in the
Tibetan version of the Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra, which is made up of four
volumes as found in the Degé Kangyur. This chapter is by far the longest,
beginning halfway through the third volume and occupying the entire
fourth volume of the Buddhāvataṃsaka. It is composed of 72 of the 115
fascicles that make up the entire sūtra, beginning with fascicle 44 (the
twenty-fourth in volume Ga). Fascicles refer to the bundles of pages in the
original Sanskrit manuscripts, usually joined up through two holes in the
center of each page. In this translation the beginning of a fascicle is simply
marked with the letter B (from the Tibetan for fascicle: bam po) and a number,
for example, [B24].
i. 29
The quality of the Tibetan translation differs from the rest of the
Buddhāvataṃsaka, either because of scribal corruption or choices of
translation. The Tibetan has peculiarities not shared with other parts of the
Avataṃsaka. For example, it retains the archaic spelling of myi and myed
instead of mi and med. The translation is less reliable than usual, as it


---

contains frequent, possibly inadvertent omissions and misspellings that
must have occurred early in the scribal transmission, as some of these errors
in the sūtra are found in all Kangyurs.
i. 30
It also exhibits a certain idiosyncrasy of translation, in that the terms may
not match what was established in the Mahāvyutpatti (bye brag tu rtogs par byed
chen po) and Madhya vyutpatti (sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa), the early ninth-
century Sanskrit–Tibetan dictionaries produced within the same state-
sponsored translation project responsible for the translation of this sūtra. For
example, vyūha is regularly translated as rgyan (“adornment”) instead of bkod
pa (“array”), even in the title of the sūtra, in spite of its being generally
known in Tibetan as sdong po bkod pa. These and other variations of the title
are touched upon in the Avataṃsaka’s editorial colophon in the Degé Kangyur
(c. 11).
i. 31
According to that colophon, this edition of the Avataṃsaka was prepared in
1722. This was eight years before the eighth Tai Situpa Chökyi Jungné (1700–
1774) began his work as chief editor of the Degé Kangyur. He states in his
account of the creation of the Kangyur: “I began in the Iron Dog year,”
which was 1730, and the carving and printing of the Degé woodblocks did
not begin until 1737 and was completed in 1744. It was nevertheless done
under the command of the Degé King Tenpa Tsering (1678–1738), as was the
entire Degé Kangyur, and therefore may be an earlier edition that Situ
incorporated into his edition of the Kangyur. The colophon also states that it
was based on the Lithang Kangyur, also known as the Jangsa Tham
Kangyur. The creation of this Kangyur took five years, from 1609 until 1614.
The Lithang was the second printing of the Kangyur, which otherwise only
existed in manuscript form. The first printing was the Yongle in 1411.
32
i. 32
The colophons of the Narthang, Lhasa, and Stok Palace Kangyurs ascribe
the translation of the Buddhāvataṃsaka to a Vairocana rakṣita: “It was
translated and revised by the chief editor Lotsawa Vairocana rakṣita.” The
great Sakya master Ngorchen Könchok Lhundrup also states that the
translator was Vairocana rakṣita.
i. 33
In the editor’s colophon in the Degé it states, “It is taught that
Surendrabodhi and Vairocana rakṣita became principal editors for a Chinese
translation.” As the Indian master Surendrabodhi came to Tibet during the
reign of King Senalek (ca. 800/804–15), the identity of this Vairocana rakṣita
is a mystery, as he could not be the eleventh-century translator Vairocana-
rakṣita, nor could he be the eighth-century Vairocana. Tashi Wangchuk
adds, “I have not seen any other text or history of a translation made by any
lotsawa or paṇḍita other than those listed in the colophon to this translation
into Tibetan,” thus apparently rejecting the attribution of Vairocana rakṣita as
the translator.

excerpts from other chapters of the sūtra in his book Power, Wealth and Women
in Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism: The Gaṇḍa vyūha-sūtra.
33
· The Meaning of the Title as Translated into Tibetan ·
i. 39
As mentioned above, the sūtra’s title in Chinese translations differs from that
in Tibetan, and it was evidently known by other names in earlier centuries.
By the ninth century, however, it was known by this obscure title Gaṇḍa-
vyūha. This translation follows the ambiguous meaning assigned to it by the
early ninth-century translators into Tibetan.
i. 40
There are two versions of the Tibetan title. In the Kangyur, the title is only
mentioned in the colophon, where it is given as sdong pos rgyan. As stated
above, rgyan (“adornment”) is used throughout as the translation of vyūha
instead of the usual bkod pa (“array”). Nevertheless, it is usually referred to in
Tibetan literature as sdong po bkod pa. The Sanskrit compound does not
indicate the grammatical connection between the two terms gaṇḍa and vyūha,
but the Kangyur colophon’s sdong pos rgyan ascribes an instrumental case to
gaṇḍha, while its popularly known title sdong po bkod pa has no such case.
Neither Sanskrit nor Tibetan specifies whether gaṇḍa is singular or plural.
The title appears to have no connection with the content, unless it is taken to
refer to the successive joints in a bamboo stem, as an analogy to the
successive episodes in Sudhana’s journey.


---

i. 41
Gaṇḍa in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit can have two meanings: “stem” or
“stalk” and “pieces” or “parts” or “sections,” and the Pali specifies that, as a
variation of gaṇṭha, it can mean the section between the joints of a stem, in
addition to such things as a swelling, a boil, an excrescence, and so on. As
the sūtra is composed of a series of episodes in which Sudhana meets a
succession of teachers, the intended meaning could well have been “an
array of parts” or, more freely, “a series of episodes.” The only use of the
word gaṇḍa in the sūtra itself is within a compound in verse 112 in the
Maitreya chapter: pañca gaṇḍa gati cakra mohitam. Pañcagaṇḍika is a standard BHS
term for the five classes of existence, and therefore that compound could be
translated as meaning “the ignorance of the wheel of the five sections of
existence,” referring to hells, pretas, animals, humans, and devas. However,
because the meanings of gaṇḍa can include boil, blister, abscess, goiter,
cheek, or bubble (as well as harness, button, joint, bone, and so on), the
Tibetan here translates gaṇḍa as “blister” (shu ba) so that the Tibetan
translation of this compound is shu ba’i lam rgyud lnga yi ’khor lor rmongs (“the
ignorance of the wheels of the blisters of the five existences,” which seems
unlikely to have been the original intended meaning).
i. 42
Douglas Osto also points out that gaṇḍa has been used as the first element
of a compound in Sanskrit to mean “great” or “supreme,” and he therefore
has translated gaṇḍa vyūha as “Supreme Array,” which would have made for a
reasonable title.
i. 43
However, the English translation of the title here, “Stem Array,” follows
the better-known version of the Tibetan title, preserving its peculiar
ambiguity, while the less familiar title as given in the colophon could have
been translated as “An Adornment by Stems.”
· The Meaning of the Title Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra ·
i. 44
The title of the sūtra in which the Gaṇḍa vyūha is the final chapter has also
been interpreted variously. The word avataṃsaka is a substantiate of avataṃsa.
In Classical Sanskrit, avataṃsa describes a garland or any circular
ornamentation. For example, karṇāvataṃsa (ear avataṃsa) means “earring.”
One peculiar Tibetan translation of buddhāvataṃsaka is “Buddha’s earring”
(snyan gyi gong rgyan). A kusumāvataṃsa (flower avataṃsa) is a flower garland
that is worn by a person, hence another Tibetan translation of
buddhāvataṃsaka is “Buddha’s garland,” using an obscure archaic word for
garland that has various spellings (rmad ga chad, rma ga chad, or rmag chad).
Thomas Cleary, translating into English from the Chinese Huayan, calls it
Flower Ornament. However, in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (BHS), avataṃsaka
means “a great number,” “a multitude,” or “a collection.” Therefore, we have


---

the Tibetan version of the title as A Multitude of Buddhas (sangs rgyas phal po
che). phal po che is used elsewhere in the Kangyur to translate Sanskrit words
meaning “multitude,” such as nicaya, for “a great assembly of beings” (skye bo
phal po che for mahat janakāya). Although this is the title given in all Kangyurs,
some, such as the Urga and Degé have the title Flower Garland (rma ga chad) at
the conclusion of each chapter, a possible indication that this was the earlier
translation of the title, which has been left unchanged within the body of the
text. However, the Mahāvyutpatti dictionary has phal po che for avataṃsaka, and
neither rma ga chad nor its variant forms appear anywhere in the dictionary.
This contradiction between the chapter colophons and the main title is
absent in the Lhasa, Stok Palace, Narthang, Lithang, and Shelkar Kangyurs.
This translation follows the example of those latter versions so as to avoid
such an evident contradiction.
i. 45
Whatever the intended meaning of the title, the Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra does
depict a multitude of buddhas, among which are multitudes of the Buddha
Śākyamuni, all of whom are emanated by the Buddha Vairocana.
i. 46
During the course of the Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra we find that the Buddha
Śākyamuni is but one of countless manifestations of the Buddha Vairocana.
Śākyamuni is even referred to as the Buddha Vairocana. The Buddha
Śākyamuni is depicted as being simultaneously present in various locations
in our world realm: at the Bodhi tree, in the Trāyastriṃśa paradise of Indra,
which is on the summit of Sumeru, in the Yāma and Tuṣita paradises high
above Sumeru, and in the highest paradise in the realm of desire —the Para-
nirmita vaśa vartin paradise. Śākyamuni is also depicted as being present in
these same locations not only in our world realm but in countless other
world realms. The Buddha Vairocana prayed to manifest in this way and to
have vast assemblies that his manifestations would teach to, and these
buddhas are the result of his prayer. According to the Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra,
not only is Vairocana the source of all buddhas everywhere, but all the
bodhisattvas whom those buddhas teach were previously pupils of Buddha
Vairocana.
i. 47
This depiction of Śākyamuni as a Vairocana emanation has its precedent in
a sūtra that was never translated into Tibetan, the Brahma jāla sūtra, which
introduces the Buddha Vairocana as the buddha who is the source of ten
billion Śākyamunis simultaneously existing in various worlds. This sūtra
should not be confused with the early Buddhist Brahma jāla sūtra, which has an
identical title but entirely different content. That Brahma jāla sūtra was
translated into Tibetan  and is included within the Pali canon.
34
i. 48
The Buddha Vairocana is therefore portrayed in the Buddhāvataṃsaka as the
fundamental buddha who is the source of countless manifestations of the
Buddha Śākyamuni. The Buddha Vairocana would also later become the


---

central buddha in tantric traditions such as the Shingon tradition of Japan,
which is based particularly on the Mahā vairocanābhisambodhi Tantra (Toh
494).  Even in the higher tantras Vairocana still retains his position as the
central buddha in the five-buddha-family system.
35
· Who Is Sudhana and What Is a Śreṣthin? ·
i. 49
The Borobudur panels portray Sudhana as a prince-like young man with a
retinue, whereas there are Chinese and Japanese depictions of him as a
chubby child. Many years pass in the course of his wanderings. In chapter 8
it is stated that he spent twelve years searching for the head merchant
Muktaka, so even if he were a child at the beginning, he would be an adult
by the end. However, the conventional passage of time is not a feature of
this sūtra. Sudhana is introduced as being part of one of four groups that
come to see Mañjuśrī when he goes to South India. There are laypeople —the
male upāsakas and female upāsikās —and dārakas and dārikas (“sons and
daughters” or “boys and girls”), which, like the compound strī puruṣa dāraka-
dārikāḥ much later in the sūtra, appears to imply parents and their children,
and this is specifically indicated when Mahāprajña, the first of the eleven
named upāsakas, is identified as the father of the first of the daughters.
However, the definition of the terms dāraka and dārika includes unmarried
males and females up to the age of twenty, and each of these sons and
daughters who come to meet Mañjuśrī is accompanied by a retinue.
Therefore, the implication is that Sudhana is not a child but presumably
around eighteen or nineteen years old. As Sudhana is the first of the eleven
named sons listed, the implication appears to be that, as the most prominent
of the sons, he is also the son of Mahāprajña. The only description of his
family is the vast, miraculous wealth they obtained upon his birth.
i. 50
Throughout the sūtra he is referred to as a śreṣṭhidāraka. The word śreṣṭhin in
Classical Sanskrit can mean “distinguished,” “eminent,” “a person of high
position,” and, more specifically, the president of a guild or a head merchant.
Edgerton, for the Buddhist Hybrid, gives “guild leader” and “capitalist.” The
Pali equivalent seṭṭhi, according to the Pali Text Society’s dictionary, can
mean “the foreman of a guild,” “a treasurer,” “a banker,” or “a wealthy
merchant.” Douglas Osto, in Power, Wealth and Women in Indian Mahāyāna
Buddhism: The Gaṇḍa vyūha-sūtra, used “merchant-banker’s son” to describe
Sudhana, but subsequently in his translation of parts of the sūtra he used the
simpler “merchant’s son.” Cleary and Carré, translating from the Chinese,
have, respectively, “youth” and jeune (“young”), omitting a translation of
śreṣṭhin. Here I follow the Tibetan translation of śreṣṭhin as tshong dpon,
literally “head merchant.”


---

i. 51
In chapter 8, Muktaka is simply called a śreṣṭhin, translated into Tibetan as
tshong dpon (“head merchant”), and this translation follows the Tibetan,
although his work is not described. Cleary translates śreṣṭhin as
“distinguished man” and also as the adjective “noble”; Carré, translating
from the Chinese, has aîné (“elder” or “superior”).
i. 52
In chapter 18, Ratnacūḍa is said to be a dharmaśreṣṭhin, which was
translated into Tibetan as chos kyi tshong dpon, literally “head merchant of the
Dharma,” presumably meaning that he is a wealthy patron of the Dharma.
Cleary translates as both “eminent person” and “religious eminent,” while
Carré translates from the Chinese simply as aîné (“elder” or “superior”).
Ratnacūḍa is twice associated with a market in the narrative and therefore
does seem to be an extremely wealthy merchant, and his ten-story house of
gold is filled with Dharma activities and even visions of buddhas and
bodhisattvas.
i. 53
In chapter 19, Samanta netra is said to be a gāndhika śreṣṭhin, translated into
Tibetan as tshong dpon spod tshong (“head-merchant perfume seller”). Cleary
translates this as “eminent perfumer,” which would correspond to the
Sanskrit, and Carré has simply aîné (“elder” or “superior”), omitting
reference to gāndhika.
i. 54
In chapter 24, Utpalabhūti is also called a gāndhika śreṣṭhin, translated into
Tibetan slightly differently than in chapter 19 as spod tshong gi tshong dpon.
Cleary again translates this as “eminent perfumer,” while Carré has simply
parfumeur (“perfumer” or “perfume seller”), omitting reference to śreṣṭhin.
i. 55
In chapter 26, Jayottama is simply called a śreṣṭhin, translated into Tibetan
as tshong dpon (“head merchant”). Cleary translates as “eminent man,” and
Carré, translating from the Chinese, has marchand (“merchant”). However, in
the narrative there is no mention of the work he does, but instead he is said
to be advising householders on civic duties, doing so in terms of the Dharma.
· The Numbers ·
i. 56
Chapters 10 and 15 of the Gaṇḍa vyūha have two long lists of numbers that
demonstrate the innumerable beings for whom bodhisattvas seek
enlightenment. Any number, no matter how large, does not encapsulate the
scope of their salvific agenda. These two lists of numbers should have been
identical. As this is a unique list of numbers, they have proved to be very
susceptible to corruption or omission. There are differences between the two
lists in the surviving Sanskrit and also for the same lists in different Sanskrit
editions. Moreover, the same numbers were translated differently into
Tibetan in the two chapters even though the translation in chapter 10 of the
Gaṇḍa vyūha is reproduced exactly in chapter 36 or the 36th sūtra in the


---

Avataṃsaka as The Teaching on Using Numbers on Being Questioned by Cittarāja.
The Gaṇḍa vyūha lists were recorded in the Mahāvyutpatti Sanskrit–Tibetan
dictionary, revealing not only that variations already existed but that they
also differed from the Kangyur versions. The Chinese should be the earliest
witness to the condition of the lists. However, Buddhabhadra and
Śikṣānanda omitted most of the numbers in the Gaṇḍa vyūha chapter, instead
writing “and so on” and jumping to the last number. Therefore, they are not
found in Carré’s translations, and Cleary reproduces the version found in the
Sanskrit. Meanwhile, Prajñā recorded the list in Chinese phonetics. The
phonetics of Chinese ideograms have varied over time and regions, but they
are still able to give an indication of the list. However, because of being a
long sequence of names for incalculable numbers, it may have suffered from
the same defects through successive copying. In addition, Śikṣānanda
transliterated the list as it occurs in chapter 36 of the Avataṃsaka. In our
translation there is an attempt to supplement omissions that have occurred
in the two lists and to find the correct Sanskrit spelling for the numbers, with
the Mahāvyutpatti record of the numbers being particularly important, so as
to create a uniformity between the lists. Some of the recorded forms of the
numbers in chapter 15 have the nominative case in -u, which may well be a
remnant of the original Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit of the sūtra. It may never
be possible to ascertain the original condition of the lists, but their purpose
was not to create a reliable mathematical tool but to overwhelm the mind
with an inconceivable vastness of numbers. Therefore, a disproportionate
amount of time has been spent on these pages of numbers, even though a
reader may very well skip over them.
36
i. 57
The system of enumeration reaches numbers of such enormous value that
they exceed even the extensive system of names for large numbers that have
been developed in English in modern times, the highest being the
googolplex (a 1 followed by a hundred zeros, and the source for the name
and verb Google). Even such a number is dwarfed by the vastness of the
universe of the Gaṇḍa vyūha, where even within each atom there are as many
buddhas as there are atoms in total. Therefore, an attempt to provide
equivalent English names foundered, and the inconsistency in the Tibetan
has resulted in choosing the Sanskrit names for this translation, though the
various Tibetan, Chinese, and Sanskrit equivalents or variants are supplied
in the endnotes.
· Challenges in the Translation ·


---

i. 58
Although the translation is based on the Degé edition, and the numbers of
the xylograph Degé folios are included within the translation, it is the
Comparative Edition of the Degé that has proved invaluable, as it contains
detailed annotations of the discrepancies with other editions of the Kangyur,
often revealing errors in the Degé. Some of these errors are evidently the
result of the copyist mishearing a word being dictated by a reader. The sūtra
existed only in handwritten copies for five centuries before the first
woodblock printing (the Yongle edition made in China) in 1410. Not
included in the Comparative Edition but consulted for this translation is the
Stok Palace Kangyur, which belongs to another group of Kangyurs and has
occasionally been alone in preserving the correct spelling, for example, rnyi
(“snare”) translating the Sanskrit jāla (“net”) while all other available
Kangyurs have snying (“essence” or “heart”).
i. 59
The Sanskrit often provides a witness as to which Kangyur has the correct
spelling. Sanskrit manuscripts are themselves just as subject to corruption,
and surviving Sanskrit manuscripts date to a later period than the Tibetan
translation. At times the Tibetan is evidently translating from a word similar
to that in the presently available Sanskrit, and therefore it may have been
translated from a manuscript in which particular words were not yet
corrupted, or it could be translating from a manuscript that contained an
error. The Chinese translations are the earliest witness to the condition of the
sūtra in Sanskrit; at times the Chinese agrees with the Tibetan and at times
with the available Sanskrit. The work of our Chinese consultant, Ling Lung
Chen, has been illuminating in this respect. An example of where the Tibetan
and the Chinese are correct and the present Sanskrit is not is where mukha
(“gateway”) has been misspelled as sukha (“bliss”). There are also cases
where the Classical Sanskrit meaning of a word has been incorrectly adopted
for the Tibetan translation instead of the Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit meaning.
Another problem is inadvertent omission of words, particularly in lists,
which may have occurred in the Sanskrit manuscript being used or early in
the process of manuscript copying in Tibet. These missing words are
included in the translation, even though the meaning would not be affected
by their omission.
i. 60
The Sanskrit has also been helpful when the meaning in Tibetan
translation is vague and open to interpretation or seems dubious in its
accuracy. Another challenge particular to this sūtra is the repetition of long
descriptive compounds that are not stock phrases and are meant to be
overwhelming, describing qualities beyond the grasp of the ordinary mind.
The meaning of words in this context and their interrelationship is open to a
wider interpretation than usual; for example, if sarva (“all”) begins a
compound, it has been open to interpretation as to which part of the


---

compound it refers to. Generally, however, in this translation the Tibetan
interpretation is followed unless there appears to be an egregious (and
noted) error or an inadvertent omission. Instances of discrepancies among
the Tibetan, the Sanskrit, and the Chinese are included in the notes.
i. 61
Tibetan does not have the precise cases that Sanskrit has; therefore, the
Sanskrit has been invaluable in indicating singular or plural as well as where
in long passages the compounds change case, such as from nominative to
instrumental in the long passage describing Sudhana at the beginning of
chapter 56.
i. 62
Also, when Sanskrit compounds are translated into Tibetan, it is not
always clear where one compound ends and the other begins. This is
sometimes indicated by the shad, the vertical line in Tibetan orthography, but
as the Tibetan editor’s colophon indicates, the placement of the shad is at
times arbitrary and confusing, the likely result of the process of copying, as
some of the errors are evidently transcription errors from listening to the text
being read. The Vaidya Sanskrit edition in Roman letters has added
punctuation that does not always agree with the Tibetan interpretation of
the structure of the sentence. The Suzuki edition of the Sanskrit has also
been useful for finding transcription errors in the Vaidya. Tibetan also tends
to translate the prefixes of Sanskrit words, while a direct translation from
Sanskrit into English would choose a word from the more extensive English
vocabulary. This translation tends to follow the latter approach rather than
the translation of prefixes. Words can be multivalent in Sanskrit, their
meaning altered according to context, and can even be interpreted as having
more than one meaning simultaneously. There are Sanskrit poems written
with a carefully chosen vocabulary to create verses that can be read as
having two different meanings. There are some terms in this sūtra where a
choice of translation necessarily means rejecting another possible meaning;
for example, vajra can refer to a thunderbolt or a diamond, and these two can
be seen in that culture as identical. In particular, however, there are two
prominent terms in this sūtra that present such a problem: dharmadhātu and
samantabhadra bodhi sattva caryā.
i. 63
The word dharmadhātu is a compound made of two elements: dharma and
dhātu. Dharma has a great number of meanings, from “the Buddha’s
teachings” to “law,” “justice,” “qualities,” “nature,” “phenomena,” and so
on, while dhātu can indicate a realm, an element, or a constituent and can be
used to mean sensory elements, the relics from an enlightened being’s
cremation, and so on. In the term lokadhātu, used over and over in this sūtra,
dhātu can mean “realm,” as in “world realm” or “a realm of worlds.” The term
dharmadhātu has been used to mean “essence or true nature of phenomena,”
such as emptiness, and so the Chinese title, which could be translated as


---

Entering the Dharmadhātu, has been translated by Carré as l’Entrée dans la
dimension absolue (Entry into the Absolute Dimension) and by Cleary as Entry into
the Realm of Reality. Osto has used the more literal “realm of the Dharma,”
which has in certain contexts been used in this translation. However, often
the meaning appears to be “the realm of phenomena” when something is
said to spread everywhere, and occasionally it could mean either, or
simultaneously both.
i. 64
The ambiguity of samantabhadra bodhi sattva caryā is reflected in differing
translations. It is a compound used repeatedly in the sūtra, and the question
is whether samantabhadra (“completely good”) is an adjective for bodhi sattva-
caryā (“bodhisattva conduct”) or whether it means the conduct of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. The sequence of the words in the compound
(this is not evident in Tibetan) would appear to signify the former meaning,
but its use in the Samanta bhadra chapter appears to indicate the latter. At
times it could mean both simultaneously.
i. 65
Neither the Tibetan nor the Chinese —nor therefore the Sanskrit from
which they were translated —had a division of the Gaṇḍa vyūha into chapters.
The later Sanskrit has a division into fifty-six chapters, and because this will
make the reading of the sūtra much easier and more accessible for the reader
in English, that chapter division has been adopted for this translation.
· Detailed Summary of The Stem Array Sūtra ·
Chapter 1: Introduction
i. 66
The Buddha Śākyamuni is in Jetavana in Śrāvastī with five thousand
bodhisattvas and five hundred śrāvakas. In their minds they wish for a
teaching, and therefore the Buddha enters samādhi, and countless buddha
realms appear there within a vast kūṭāgāra. Bodhisattvas also come from
other realms to Śrāvastī. The śrāvakas, lacking in the necessary merit, are
unable to see this miraculous display. Then ten bodhisattvas who have come
from 
the 
ten 
directions —Vairocana praṇidhāna nābhi raśmi prabha,
Duryodhana vīrya vega rāja, Samanta śrī samudgata tejorāja, Asaṅga śrī garbha-
rāja, 
Dharma dhātu praṇidhi sunirmita candra rāja, 
Dharmārciṣmattejorāja,
Sarva māra maṇḍala vikiraṇa jñāna dhvaja rāja, 
Vairocana praṇidhāna ketu-
dhvaja, Sarvāvaraṇa vikiraṇa jñāna vikrānta rāja, and Dharma dhātu praṇidhi-
tala nirbheda —recite verses describing what has occurred.
Chapter 2: Samanta bhadra


---

i. 67
The bodhisattva Samanta bhadra recites verses to the bodhisattvas
describing the inconceivable pervasion of phenomena by the buddhas. In
addition, the Buddha, still in samādhi, emanates a ray of light from between
his eyebrows so that the bodhisattvas can see these countless buddha
realms, and in a state of great joy the bodhisattvas emanate countless
manifestations. On seeing this, Mañjuśrī recites verses describing this event.
Chapter 3: Mañjuśrī
i. 68
Through the Buddha’s blessing, Śāriputra is enabled to see Mañjuśrī, who is
departing for South India. Accompanied by his sixty pupils, he follows
Mañjuśrī. He praises Mañjuśrī to his pupil Sāgara buddhi. They all go to
Mañjuśrī and pay homage to him, and Mañjuśrī teaches them ten
motivations. Then Mañjuśrī goes to Vicitra sāla dhvaja vyūha Forest near the
city of Dhanyākara. The laypeople of the city, hearing that Mañjuśrī is in the
forest, go to see him. Among them is Sudhana, the son of a prominent
upāsaka. Mañjuśrī describes the miracles that occurred at Sudhana’s birth,
praises Sudhana, and teaches him and the others about the nature of
buddhas. Mañjuśrī departs; Sudhana follows him and in verse praises him
and requests teaching. Mañjuśrī instructs him to develop bodhisattva
conduct by relying on kalyāṇamitras. He tells him to go to the bhikṣu
Meghaśrī, who is on Sugrīva Mountain in the southern land of Rāmāvarānta.
Chapter 4: Meghaśrī
i. 69
Sudhana arrives in Rāmāvarānta and finds the bhikṣu Meghaśrī walking on
a plateau on the summit of a mountain. Meghaśrī describes how he can see
all tathāgatas in every direction. However, he states that his knowledge is
limited, and he cannot describe the various accomplishments that enable
other bodhisattvas to see all the tathāgatas, and he instructs Sudhana to go
to the bhikṣu Sāgara megha in Sāgara mukha so as to receive instruction on
the way of the bodhisattva.
Chapter 5: Sāgara megha
i. 70
Sudhana meets Sāgara megha, who describes how by focusing on the ocean
and its qualities over twelve years he saw a buddha seated on a giant
precious lotus arise from the ocean, with countless deities of various kinds
paying homage to that buddha, who gave him a teaching called All-Seeing
Eyes, which was so vast that even one chapter of it was too long to ever be
written out. Sāgara megha then gave this teaching to the nonhuman beings


---

who came from all directions. However, he states that his knowledge is
limited to this teaching and instructs Sudhana to go receive instruction on
the way of the bodhisattva from the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita in Sāgara tīra.
Chapter 6: Supratiṣṭhita
i. 71
Sudhana searches for Supratiṣṭhita and eventually sees him walking in the
sky accompanied by a vast gathering of various kinds of deities, who pay
homage to him. Supratiṣṭhita states that he has attained a wisdom called the
unimpeded apex, so that he knows past lives, all past buddhas, all languages,
when to guide beings, and so on, and can perform all kinds of miracles.
However, he states that his knowledge is limited to this liberation and
instructs Sudhana to go receive instruction on the way of the bodhisattva
from a Dravidian named Megha in the town of Vajrapura in the land of
Draviḍa.
Chapter 7: Megha
i. 72
Sudhana finds Megha teaching on a throne in a courtyard in the town of
Vajrapura. Megha comes down from his throne and makes many offerings to
Sudhana. He praises the bodhisattvas through various analogies, and light
rays shine from his mouth, spreading throughout the universe. Many deities
of various kinds come to listen. Then Megha sits back on his throne and
states that he has attained Sarasvatī’s power of retention, so that he knows
the languages of all the different kinds of deities and other beings
throughout all worlds. However, he states that his knowledge is limited to
this Sarasvatī power of retention, and he instructs Sudhana to go receive
instruction on the way of the bodhisattva from a head merchant named
Muktaka in the land of Vanavāsī.
Chapter 8: Muktaka
i. 73
After twelve years Sudhana reaches Vanavāsī and finds Muktaka. Muktaka
enters a state of meditation through the power of retention called the assembly
of all the buddha realms, and countless buddhas, their deeds, their realms, and
their pupils become visible within his body. He comes out of his meditation
and states that through the liberation called the unimpeded display, he can see
any buddha in any realm or time that he wishes to, and he is aware that his
mind’s perceptions are the mind’s own illusions and that all attainment is
the attainment of the mind. However, he states that his knowledge is limited


---

to this liberation called the unimpeded display, and he instructs Sudhana to go
receive instruction on the way of the bodhisattva from a bhikṣu named
Sāgara dhvaja in the land of Milaspharaṇa at the southern tip of India.
Chapter 9: Sāgara dhvaja
i. 74
Sudhana arrives at Milaspharaṇa and finds the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja sitting
in meditation at the end of a meditation walkway. He is emanating various
kinds of beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas from different parts of his body,
and these emanations are spreading throughout all the buddha realms,
accomplishing various kinds of activities. Sudhana sits before him for six
months and six days, until Sāgara dhvaja rises from his samādhi. He
describes to Sudhana the nature of the samādhi he has attained, but he states
that his knowledge is limited to that and instructs him to go to request
teaching from the upāsikā Āśā in a park outside the town of Mahāprabhasa.
Chapter 10: Āśā
i. 75
Sudhana arrives at Samanta vyūha Park, which is miraculously beautiful and
made of precious substances. The upāsikā Āśā is seated on a throne inside a
magnificent palace, with vast numbers of beings of various kinds paying
homage to her. She tells Sudhana she has attained the bodhisattva liberation
called the banner of bliss without sorrow and recounts her past as a pupil of
innumerable buddhas. She emphasizes how bodhisattvas are dedicated to
the welfare of all beings. However, as her knowledge is limited to her
bodhisattva liberation, she instructs him to go to the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa
in the land named Nālayu.
Chapter 11: Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa
i. 76
Sudhana arrives in Nālayu and finds the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa, along with
ten thousand young brahmin pupils, in an ashram in a miraculously
beautiful forest. Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa tells his pupils of Sudhana’s greatness,
and they make offerings to him. Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa tells Sudhana that he
has attained the bodhisattva liberation called the banner of being invincible to
others. He places his hand on Sudhana’s head, and Sudhana sees
innumerable buddha realms and hears the teachings of those buddhas for
innumerable kalpas. When Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa removes his hand, Sudhana
is back in the forest at that same time. Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa says his
knowledge is limited to this bodhisattva liberation and instructs him to go to
the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana in the land of Īṣāṇa.


---

Chapter 12: Jayoṣmāyatana
i. 77
Sudhana finds the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana undertaking the ascetic practice
of sitting beneath a cliff surrounded by four fires and under the noonday
sun. He tells Sudhana that if he climbs to the top of the precipice above him
and jumps into a fire, he will have pure conduct. On hearing this, Sudhana
has doubts about Jayoṣmāyatana, but deities appear in the sky describing
how Jayoṣmāyatana’s asceticism has benefited them on the path to
buddhahood. Sudhana then obeys the brahmin’s instructions, and leaping
into the fire, he is unharmed and attains samādhi. Jayoṣmāyatana then tells
Sudhana that his own knowledge is limited to this bodhisattva liberation
called the unceasing domain and therefore he should go to Princess Maitrayaṇī
in the city of Siṃha vijṛmbhita.
Chapter 13: Maitrayaṇī
i. 78
Sudhana finds Princess Maitrayaṇī with an entourage of five hundred
maidens in a miraculous palace. She instructs Sudhana to look around the
palace, and he sees innumerable buddhas in every object. She tells Sudhana
that she has attained the gateway to the perfection of wisdom called the
complete display of memory, but as her knowledge is limited to that, he should
go to the bhikṣu Sudarśana in the land called Trinayana.
Chapter 14: Sudarśana
i. 79
After a long search, Sudhana finds the bhikṣu Sudarśana attended by devas
while practicing walking meditation in a forest. He tells Sudhana that within
his lifetime, he has been the pupil of innumerable buddhas for vast lengths
of time and perceives countless buddhas as he practices his walking
meditation. However, his knowledge is limited to this bodhisattva liberation
called the never-extinguished lamp of wisdom. Therefore, he instructs Sudhana to
go to a boy named Indriyeśvara in the city of Sumukha.
Chapter 15: Indriyeśvara
i. 80
Sudhana finds Indriyeśvara playing in the sand with ten thousand other
children. Indriyeśvara tells Sudhana that he has been the pupil of Mañjuśrī
and has mastered all kinds of branches of knowledge. In particular he relates
at length the system of enumeration that bodhisattvas use. However, his


---

knowledge is limited to this gateway called the wisdom that possesses
clairvoyance in all crafts. Therefore, he instructs Sudhana to go to the upāsikā
Prabhūtā in the town of Samudra pratiṣṭhāna.
Chapter 16: Prabhūtā
i. 81
Sudhana finds the young girl Prabhūtā in a marvelous house, wearing a
simple white robe and no jewelry, with just a small pot before her and no
other provisions in her house. Ten thousand beautiful maidens are present
as her attendants. She tells Sudhana that she has attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the unceasing display of the treasure of merit. Through this she is
able to provide countless beings in all directions with whatever they wish
out of her small pot. With the food from her pot, she aids śrāvakas, pratyeka-
buddhas, and bodhisattvas in countless realms in attaining their
enlightenments. Sudhana witnesses countless beings arriving at her home
and receiving whatever they wish from the pot. Prabhūtā then says that as
her knowledge is limited to this bodhisattva liberation, he should go to the
householder Vidvān in the town of Mahāsaṃbhava.
Chapter 17: Vidvān
i. 82
Sudhana finds Vidvān upon a throne on a platform at the crossroads in the
center of the town. Vidvān tells Sudhana that he has attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the merit that arises from the treasury of the mind. Therefore, he is
able to provide beings with whatever they wish, and he has brought his
entourage of ten thousand musicians onto the path to enlightenment.
Sudhana sees countless beings arrive. When Vidvān looks up into the sky,
all that the beings wish for comes down into Vidvān’s hands, and he gives it
to them. However, Vidvān says his knowledge is limited to this bodhisattva
liberation and instructs Sudhana to go to see the head merchant and Dharma
patron named Ratnacūḍa in the town of Siṃhapota.
Chapter 18: Ratnacūḍa
i. 83
Sudhana finds Ratnacūḍa in the town’s market. Ratnacūḍa takes him to his
ten-story home made of gold. On the first four floors he witnesses
bodhisattva activity of generosity, and on the fifth floor and upward he sees
bodhisattvas discussing the Dharma. On the tenth floor all the bodhisattvas
are in their last life. Ratnacūḍa tells Sudhana how in the past he made an
offering of incense to a buddha and the aroma covered the entire world for a
week. This resulted in his attaining the bodhisattva liberation called the


---

unimpeded display of the field of prayer, through which he can see all buddhas
and bodhisattvas. However, as his knowledge is limited to this bodhisattva
liberation, he instructs Sudhana to go to a perfume seller by the name of
Samanta netra in the town of Samanta mukha.
Chapter 19: Samanta netra
i. 84
Sudhana finds Samanta netra in a perfume shop in the middle of the town.
Samanta netra describes how he can cure all illnesses, heal beings, and set
them on the path to enlightenment. He is also able to make an offering of
perfume to all buddha realms. However, his knowledge is limited to this
gateway called the forms of perfume that satisfy all beings and through which in
every way one sees, makes offerings to, and honors the buddhas. Therefore, he
instructs him to go to King Anala in the town of Tāladhvaja.
Chapter 20: Anala
i. 85
Sudhana finds King Anala sitting on the throne in judgment on hundreds of
thousands of criminals as a horde of terrifying executioners punish them in
various ways, creating a lake of blood and a mountain of body parts.
Sudhana has doubts as to whether King Anala is a bodhisattva, but deities
appear in the sky and tell him not to doubt. King Anala takes Sudhana into
his palace and explains that what he has seen is an illusion the king creates
to inspire beings to avoid bad actions. He states that his knowledge is
limited to this bodhisattva liberation called the attainment of illusions and
therefore instructs Sudhana to go to King Mahāprabha in the city called
Suprabha.
Chapter 21: Mahāprabha
i. 86
After a long search, Sudhana finds the city of Suprabha, which appears to be
miraculously made of precious materials. He finds King Mahāprabha seated
on a throne in the city along with vast amounts of goods, animals, and
women arranged as gifts. King Mahāprabha tells Sudhana that he has
attained the bodhisattva conduct called the banner of great love from countless
buddhas. He provides everyone in his kingdom with whatever they wish.
He states that some beings see the city as ordinary, while others see it as
made of precious materials, and this is according to their realization. The
king demonstrates entering a samādhi that causes the entire country to
shake. Beings, deities, and even mountains and plants bow in his direction.
In the same way he brings happiness and serenity to beings in countless


---

realms. King Mahāprabha states that his knowledge is limited to the banner of
great love and instructs him to go see the upāsikā Acalā in the city called
Sthirā.
Chapter 22: Acalā
i. 87
Sudhana reaches the city of Sthirā and finds the upāsikā Acalā at home with
her parents in a house shining with a golden light that causes Sudhana to
enter states of samādhi. She is extremely beautiful, shining with light, and
has an exceptional aroma. Acalā describes her past life as a princess during
the time of the Buddha Pralambabāhu. One night she saw him shining in the
sky, and since that time she has followed his instructions for many kalpas.
She demonstrates her miraculous power of revealing to him a vision of
countless buddha realms made of beryl. She states that her attainment is
limited to a certain conduct, samādhi, and the liberation called the essence of
the wisdom that is difficult to attain, and she instructs Sudhana to go see the
parivrājaka Sarvagamin.
Chapter 23: Sarvagamin
i. 88
After a long journey, Sudhana reaches the town of Tosala in the land called
Amitatosala. Having searched through the town, he goes to a shining hill
called Sulabha to the north of the town. At its summit he finds Sarvagamin
being honored by ten thousand brahmins. Sarvagamin describes how
through the samādhi called the light of the practice of all gateways he can benefit
beings in many ways throughout many worlds. He instructs Sudhana to go
to the perfume merchant Utpalabhūti.
Chapter 24: Utpalabhūti
i. 89
Sudhana arrives in the land called Pṛthurāṣṭra and finds the perfume
merchant Utpalabhūti, who tells Sudhana of his mastery of perfumes that
have magical and spiritual effects. He tells Sudhana to go to a mariner by the
name of Vaira.
Chapter 25: Vaira
i. 90
Sudhana goes to the city of Kūṭāgāra and finds the mariner Vaira at the city’s
gate on the shore of the ocean, where he is telling tales of the sea to a
hundred thousand merchants and many hundreds of thousands of other
people and describing the qualities of the Buddha. He tells Sudhana that he


---

practices the bodhisattva conduct called the banner of great compassion, aids
beings in various ways, knows the locations of islands and treasures and the
ways of sailing on the ocean, and sets beings toward enlightenment through
his teaching. However, his attainment is limited to the bodhisattva liberation
called remembering to abide with the fruitful hearing and seeing of the banner of great
compassion, and therefore he instructs Sudhana to go to see the head
merchant Jayottama.
Chapter 26: Jayottama
i. 91
Sudhana reaches the town called Nandihāra and finds Jayottama in a forest
on the eastern side of the town, speaking about civic duties to many
thousands of householders. He tells Sudhana how in many worlds he
teaches the Dharma, pacifies disputes and wars, guides people away from
bad behavior, and sets them on the path to enlightenment. He tells Sudhana
to go see a bhikṣuṇī by the name of Siṃha vijṛmbhitā.
Chapter 27: Siṃhavijṛmbhitā
i. 92
Sudhana arrives in the town of Kaliṅgavana in the land of Śroṇāparānta and
finds Siṃha vijṛmbhitā in a park named Sūrya prabha that, because of her
miraculous power, is covered with jewels and other miraculous
manifestations. There are thrones at the foot of jewel trees, on all of which sit
Siṃha vijṛmbhitā teaching the Dharma to various kinds of beings and
bodhisattvas. She tells Sudhana that she has attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the eradication of all conceit, which enables her to go in various
forms to various worlds to make offerings to buddhas and bodhisattvas.
Stating that her realization is limited, she instructs him to go see a courtesan
named Vasumitrā.
Chapter 28: Vasumitrā
i. 93
Sudhana arrives in the city of Ratnavyūha in the land of Durga and searches
for the courtesan Vasumitrā. The people who do not know her qualities
wonder why a practitioner like Sudhana would want to see her. Those who
do know her qualities tell him where her home is. It is vast, comprising many
buildings made of precious materials and divine in appearance. She is
beautiful and skilled in languages and all arts and treatises. Her body
illuminates her residence. She tells Sudhana that she takes on a beautiful
form among various kinds of beings who are under the power of desire and
teaches them the Dharma to free them from desire, and that they also become


---

free from desire on seeing her, touching her, kissing her, and so on. She
describes that in a past life she was a head merchant’s wife who offered a
bell to the Buddha Atyuccagāmin, who had entered their city accompanied
by miraculous events. Mañjuśrī was an attendant of that buddha and set her
on the path to enlightenment. She states that her attainment is limited to the
bodhisattva liberation called the complete attainment of freedom from desire and
instructs him to go see the householder Veṣṭhila.
Chapter 29: Veṣṭhila
i. 94
Sudhana goes to the town of Śubhapāraṃgama, where he meets the
householder Veṣṭhila, who attained the samādhi called the display of the
unceasing family of the buddhas when he opened the door of a shrine. Through
this samādhi he sees countless buddhas of the past, present, and future. He
instructs Sudhana to meet the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara.
Chapter 30: Avalokiteśvara
i. 95
Sudhana goes to the Potalaka Mountain and on its western side finds
Avalokiteśvara teaching within a forest grove. Avalokiteśvara places his
radiant hand on Sudhana’s head and tells him that he has the bodhisattva
activity called the unimpeded gateway to great compassion. He describes how he
benefits beings through various manifestations and emanations, freeing
them from various kinds of fear. However, being limited to that activity, he
instructs Sudhana to go to the Cakravāla mountain range to see the
bodhisattva Ananyagāmin, who has just come from another world realm in
the east.
Chapter 31: Ananyagāmin
i. 96
Sudhana goes to see the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin, who says that in the
eastern realm of Śrīgarbhavatī he has attained the bodhisattva liberation
called the arising of every gateway at the feet of the Buddha Samanta śrī-
saṃbhava, and that it has taken him countless kalpas to reach this world,
even though he passed countless realms with each step. He also made
offerings to all the buddhas in those realms and manifested bodies to benefit
the beings there, and he did this while approaching this world from all other
directions simultaneously. He tells Sudhana that his attainment is limited to
the bodhisattva liberation called the arising of every gateway and instructs him
to go see the deity Mahādeva.


---

Chapter 32: Mahādeva
i. 97
Sudhana reaches the city named Dvāravatī and finds the deity Mahādeva in
a temple in the center of the city. When Sudhana asks him for instruction, he
extends his four arms to the four great oceans and brings back water to rinse
out his mouth. He praises bodhisattvas, who are so difficult to meet, and
states that he has attained the bodhisattva liberation called the net of clouds.
Through that liberation he manifests heaps of jewels and precious objects in
front of Sudhana for him to use as offerings to the buddhas in order to gain
merit. In that way he establishes countless beings in the practice of
generosity. He manifests ugliness to those with desire, terrifying
manifestations to the proud, and dangers to the lazy, so that they will follow
the Dharma. As he is limited to this bodhisattva liberation, he instructs
Sudhana to go from South India to Magadha in North India, to the site of the
Buddha’s enlightenment, and see the earth goddess Sthāvarā there.
Chapter 33: Sthāvarā
i. 98
Sudhana leaves South India and reaches the bodhimaṇḍa in Magadha. As he
approaches the earth goddess Sthāvarā, another million earth goddesses
declare that a great realized being is approaching. They manifest an array of
miraculous appearances. Sthāvarā states that Sudhana has accumulated
merit in this place in past lives and demonstrates its result by stamping on
the ground so that there appear millions of treasures that Sudhana will
always be able to use. She states that she has attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the essence of invincible wisdom, as a result of which she has
practiced the Dharma and protected bodhisattvas since the time of the
Buddha Dīpaṅkara. She received this liberation from the Buddha Sunetra
many kalpas previously and since then has always been in the presence of
buddhas. As she is limited to this bodhisattva liberation, she instructs
Sudhana to go to Kapilavastu, the hometown of the Buddha Śākyamuni, to
see the night goddess Vāsantī.
Chapter 34: Vāsantī
i. 99
Sudhana reaches Kapilavastu, and after sunset he sees the night goddess
Vāsantī in the sky above the town. She has a golden body, and he sees in her
pores the realms of beings she has liberated and her various emanations,
and he also hears from her pores the Dharma teachings she has given. She
tells Sudhana that she has attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
gateway to guiding beings through the radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the
darkness of all beings. She describes how she helps various beings who are


---

distressed in various ways in darkness, and how she liberates beings from
the darkness of saṃsāra and protects and saves beings from physical and
spiritual dangers. Then she describes these activities in verse. She then
explains that many kalpas previously, she had been a queen who was
awoken one night by a night goddess named Suviśuddha candrābhā, who
told her that the Buddha Sarva dharma nigarjita rāja had just attained
buddhahood in a nearby forest and had manifested a miraculous light. She
went to that buddha, entered the Dharma, and in every lifetime that followed
had a fortunate rebirth and accumulated merit. After countless kalpas, she
became the beautiful daughter of a head merchant, and the night goddess
Suviśuddha candrābhā had become a night goddess named Viśuddha-
netrābhā. One night the night goddess revealed herself to the merchant’s
daughter and told her of the Buddha Sumeru dhvajāyatana śānta netra śrī,
who had attained buddhahood seven days previously and was the first of
five hundred buddhas who would appear in that kalpa. The merchant’s
daughter went to that buddha and on seeing his face remembered her
previous lives. It was from that buddha that she received the bodhisattva
liberation called the gateway to guiding beings through the radiance of the Dharma
that eliminates the darkness of all beings. As a result, she could be in countless
realms before many buddhas simultaneously, knew the languages of beings
in countless realms, and manifested to them in various ways. However, she
says that she is limited to this attainment and instructs Sudhana to go back
to the bodhimaṇḍa to see the night goddess Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala-
prabhā.
Chapter 35: Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā
i. 100
Sudhana returns to the bodhimaṇḍa and sees the night goddess Samanta-
gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā. 
She 
instructs 
him 
in 
ten 
qualities 
that
bodhisattvas need to attain. She states that she has attained the bodhisattva
liberation called complete subjugation through the bliss of the peace of śamatha,
through which she can see all the buddhas in the three times, receive all
their teachings, and ripen beings in various ways. Stating that she is limited
to this liberation, she instructs Sudhana to go see the night goddess
Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā, who is nearby.
Chapter 36: Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā
i. 101
Sudhana goes to the southern side of the bodhimaṇḍa, where he sees the
night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā. Sudhana sees emanated
bodies, as numerous as all beings, coming from all her pores, teaching the


---

path of the bodhisattva to beings in different languages and forms. Sudhana
praises her in verse and then asks her when she attained her bodhisattva
liberation called the banner of the power of vast, stainless, completely good joy.
Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā replies in verse, describing how in a
previous world in the distant past she was the queen of a cakravartin. She
was awoken by night goddesses on the night that a buddha named
Śrisamudra attained buddhahood and shone with a miraculous light. She
woke the king, the court, and the other queens, and with a great mass of
people they went to the Buddha. That was when she first developed the
aspiration to attain buddhahood, and she particularly prayed to become like
those night goddesses. She lists the numerous buddhas whom she offered to
and received teachings from throughout a number of worlds and kalpas.
Finally she received and attained her bodhisattva liberation from the Buddha
Ratna śrī pradīpa guṇa ketu and then, out of compassion for beings, took on
her present form as a night goddess. However, she states that she is limited
to that attainment and instructs Sudhana to go to the night goddess
Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, who is nearby among the assembly at the
bodhimaṇḍa.
Chapter 37: Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī
i. 102
As Sudhana walks the short distance to see the night goddess Samanta-
sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, she radiates onto him a light ray that causes him to enter a
samādhi and see worlds in the atoms of the ground, and to see her
appearing in them all to guide and help beings through the power of her
bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that guide beings that appear in all
worlds. Sudhana recites verses to her, describing this vision, and asks her
when she attained that liberation. She describes how countless kalpas in the
past, in a world called Vairocana tejaḥśrī, she was a princess named Padma-
bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā, the daughter of a cakravartin who ruled all
four continents. North of the capital there was a Bodhi tree, before which
was a lake with a magical lotus in its center, upon which was the Buddha
Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja, the first of countless buddhas to
appear in that kalpa. Over a period of ten thousand years, he radiated light
rays to the beings in that world, informing them and preparing them for his
eventual appearance as a buddha. At the moment of his attainment of
buddhahood in that world, there were miraculous omens everywhere. The
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra appeared above the cakravartin’s palace, his
radiance outshining all other lights. He informed the king that a buddha had
appeared at the Bodhi tree. On seeing Samanta bhadra, the princess wished
to be with him always, in all her lives. The king manifested miraculously


---

throughout the world, encouraging everyone to come and see the Buddha.
On seeing the Buddha, the princess cast her jewels toward him, and they
formed a miraculous display in the air. She had a vision of Samanta bhadra’s
presence throughout countless worlds and attained various samādhis. The
buddha told her that in a past life Samanta bhadra had instructed her to
repair the statue of the buddha of that time and that this had been the cause
of her good rebirths and connection with buddhas and Samanta bhadra in all
her lives. The night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī then explains to
Sudhana that she had been the princess, Maitreya was the king, and his
queen, the mother of the princess, was the night goddess Praśanta ruta-
sāgara vatī. Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī describes how she attended and made
offerings to a succession of buddhas through the kalpas, and she describes
the teachings she received from some of them. She lists a number of buddhas
in verse, and finally says that her attainment is limited to the bodhisattva
liberation called the manifestations that guide beings that appear in all worlds and
that Sudhana should go to see the nearby night goddess Praśanta ruta-
sāgara vatī.
Chapter 38: Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī
i. 103
Sudhana goes directly to the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī, who
tells him she has attained the bodhisattva liberation called the display in each
instant of mind of the arising of the power of vast delight. She explains that she
teaches the Dharma everywhere in various ways to beings and that she can
see all bodhisattvas wherever they are and whatever are they doing. In
particular she sees how the Buddha, whom she calls Vairocana, in every
instant radiates light rays everywhere that take on various forms to guide
beings, and seeing this gives her great delight. She describes the vast
qualities of her liberation, and when Sudhana asks her about her past, she
states that in a world realm called Kanaka vimala prabhā vyūha, beyond many
worlds to the east, there was a buddha named Avivartya dharma dhātu-
nirghoṣa, and she was a goddess at the bodhimaṇḍa of that world. On
seeing him she first developed the aspiration to enlightenment, and
subsequently in various lifetimes she attended every buddha that appeared
in an innumerable succession in that world, thereby attaining various
samādhis. Then she was reborn in this Sahā world, where she has attended
the first four buddhas and will attend all those who will come. On seeing the
present buddha, Vairocana, she attained her bodhisattva liberation. After
that she could see as many realms and buddhas as there are atoms within
each atom and was able to receive all their teachings in each instant of mind.


---

However, as she is limited to this liberation, she instructs Sudhana to go to
the nearby night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī, who is there
in Vairocana’s assembly.
Chapter 39: Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī
i. 104
Sudhana sees the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī seated
on a lotus throne and having a body that can appear to and communicate
with all beings. She tells him she has attained a bodhisattva liberation called
the entry into beautiful sounds and profound manifestations. She describes how she
guides beings, teaching the Dharma in various ways, and how she sees the
realm of phenomena in ten ways and teaches through thousands of powers
of mental retention, ten of which she lists. She describes how in the distant
past there was a kalpa in one world where countless buddhas appeared, the
first of which was Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa prabha rāja. At that time there
was a cakravartin king who after the buddha’s passing used his miraculous
powers to create a display to revive the declining teachings. His daughter,
who was a bhikṣuṇī, on seeing that miracle attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the entry into beautiful sounds and profound manifestations. The
night goddess reveals that she was the bhikṣuṇī and the king was the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. She then lists the names of just over a hundred
of the countless buddhas of that kalpa, all of whom she was a pupil of, and
for countless kalpas since, she has been attending buddhas. She says she is
limited to this bodhisattva liberation and instructs Sudhana to go to the night
goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā, who is nearby at the feet of
the Buddha Vairocana, the name she uses for Śākyamuni.
Chapter 40: Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā
i. 105
The night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā is seated in a
kūṭāgāra, on a throne made of precious branches. She tells Sudhana how
night makes beings wish to return to their homes and how she leads beings
to good conduct and liberation. She states she has attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the arising of the vast radiating light of joy, which has the
knowledge for gathering beings as pupils. Through it she remembers the
past conduct, progress, and attainment of the Buddha, referred to as the
Buddha Vairocana. She states that this bodhisattva liberation can only be
comprehended by the buddhas, but through their blessing she can teach it,
and she then repeats this in verse. Sudhana asks her when she gained this
attainment, and she describes how in a past kalpa, in another world, beings
were in distress because of famine and poverty caused by their bad conduct.


---

They entreated the cakravartin king Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala-
nirghoṣa for help, and he arranged a great distribution of all his wealth to
satisfy all beings. At that time a girl named Ratnaprabhā, on seeing the king,
was inspired to attain enlightenment, and she recited to him verses that
described his birth. She said that his father was King Jyotiṣprabha and his
mother was Queen Padmaprabhā. At a time when no rain had fallen for
years and everything was withered, there was a bright light in a lotus pond
in their park for seven nights before his birth, during which all the lotus
ponds filled with water that spread throughout the world, ending thirst and
flattening the surface of the earth. On the seventh night their son appeared
miraculously, sitting cross-legged in a gigantic lotus, and the king took him
and gave him to his queen as her son. Light rays from his body eliminated all
harm and illness throughout the world and made everyone kind and
compassionate. When Ratnaprabhā finished her verses, the king gave her
and her entourage of five hundred girls precious clothes, upon which the
images of constellations and stars appeared. People said the girls were more
beautiful than the goddess of the night. Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā
then tells Sudhana that King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa
was the Buddha; King Jyotiṣprabha was Śuddhodana, the Buddha’s father in
this life; Queen Padmaprabhā was Māyādevī, the Buddha’s mother in this
life; and she herself was the girl Ratnaprabhā. She then says that her
attainment is limited to her bodhisattva liberation and tells Sudhana to go to
the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā, who is also
present at the bodhimaṇḍa.
Chapter 41: Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā
i. 106
Sudhana sees Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā with the images of all
the stars and so on in her body. She manifests bodies in various forms to
beings throughout the realm of phenomena. Gazing upon her, Sudhana
attains ten pure perceptions and numerous “commonalities” with the
bodhisattvas. Sudhana addresses her in verse, and she tells him that she has
attained the bodhisattva liberation called the origin of the roots of merit that
inspire the ripening of all beings. This means that having realized the unreality
of phenomena, she can manifest in any miraculous form in order to benefit
beings in every instant. She states that while bodhisattvas have transcended
concepts of time and so on, they are still engaged in benefiting beings in
terms of their perceptions, like magical apparitions that have no reality. She
describes how in a distant past she was a prince named Vijitāvin whose
father had imprisoned many beings for their wicked behavior, and who
through compassion for them offered to take their place if they were


---

released. The ministers convinced the king that this was a dangerous plot,
and so he sentenced the prince to execution. The queen obtained permission
for the prince to make a charitable donation of all his possessions for a
fortnight, and he did so without regret, giving everything away. On the last
day of the donations, Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, the
buddha who had appeared in that realm, came there miraculously, inspiring
faith, and the prince attained the bodhisattva liberation called the origin of the
roots of merit that inspire the ripening of all beings and received permission from
the king to become a bhikṣu. She states that the ministers of that time were
Devadatta’s followers in this lifetime, but they would all become buddhas in
a future kalpa. The freed prisoners were the buddhas of the present kalpa
and numerous other bodhisattvas. The king’s many queens and harem
guards were the Jain followers of Satyaka, whom the Buddha Śākyamuni
had declared to be a bodhisattva. Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā
lists some of the many buddhas she followed in the intermediate time. After
summarizing in verse what she has told him, she states that her attainment is
limited to this bodhisattva liberation and tells Sudhana to go to the forest
goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī in Lumbinī.
Chapter 42: Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī
i. 107
Sudhana goes to the Lumbinī Forest and sees Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī inside a
kūṭāgāra made of precious tree branches, teaching a sūtra to millions of
forest goddesses. She teaches Sudhana in prose and again in verse the ten
kinds of birth through which a bodhisattva enters the family of the
tathāgatas. She states that she has attained the bodhisattva liberation called
the miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions
of countless kalpas. She states that through her past prayers she was born in
this forest to observe the birth of the Buddha and describes the ten omens
that presaged his birth, the ten omens of light when the Buddha’s mother
came to the forest, and the ten miraculous manifestations at the time of his
birth. She states that she sees such miraculous births in every world and that
she sees the buddhas that are in every atom in all worlds. She describes how
countless kalpas ago, she was a nurse named Vimala saṃbhava prabhā who
was present when the Buddha Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja was born to Queen
Suharṣita prabheśvarā in a park. Because she was the nurse, the baby was
placed on her lap by deities, and at that moment she attained her bodhisattva
liberation. The king and queen of that time were previous lives of the
Buddha Śākyamuni’s parents. Since that time she has witnessed the birth of


---

every buddha everywhere. She repeats this in verse and then states that she
is limited to this bodhisattva liberation, and therefore Sudhana should go see
Gopā, who was the Buddha’s wife, in Kapilavastu.
Chapter 43: Gopā
i. 108
Sudhana arrives in Kapilavastu and is greeted and praised by Aśokaśrī, the
goddess of the Kapilavastu assembly hall. Sudhana describes his
bodhisattva path to her. She and other goddesses make offerings to him and
praise him in verse. Sudhana enters the assembly hall and sees Gopā and her
entourage of royal women, all of whom practice the bodhisattva path. In
prose and then in verse, Gopā teaches Sudhana the ten qualities of
bodhisattva conduct and the ten ways to please kalyāṇamitras. She states
that she has attained the bodhisattva liberation called the range of the view of all
the ways of the ocean of the samādhis of the bodhisattvas. Through this she
perceives all buddhas, pratyeka buddhas, bodhisattvas, and their activities
and qualities in the past, present, and future. In particular she knows all the
past lives of the Buddha Vairocana, that is, the Buddha Śākyamuni. She then
describes how in a distant past she was a courtesan’s daughter who fell in
love with a prince named Tejodhipati, who was dedicated to the bodhisattva
path, and became his wife. Together, throughout many lifetimes, they
venerated a succession of sixty hundred thousand trillion buddhas, after
which she attained her bodhisattva liberation. During all that time she was
able to gaze upon her husband’s wonderful qualities, up until this lifetime
when he became the Buddha Śākyamuni. She states that Tejodhipati’s
mother was a previous life of Māyādevī, Śākyamuni’s mother, and that
Tejodhipati’s father, King Dhanapati, is now a buddha in an eastern realm.
She tells Sudhana that her attainment is limited to this liberation and that he
should go to Māyādevī, the Buddha’s mother, who is presently at the
Buddha’s feet. Before Sudhana leaves, she describes in verse an even earlier
lifetime in which she was a merchant’s daughter named Bhānuprabhā, who
developed devotion to a mendicant by the name of Suraśmiketu, who had
been a prince. She made offerings to him, and as a result had good rebirths
for two hundred and fifty kalpas, culminating in her rebirth as the
courtesan’s daughter, which is when she first made the aspiration to attain
buddhahood.
Chapter 44: Māyādevī


---

i. 109
Ratnanetrā, the goddess of the city, appears in the sky to Sudhana and
instructs him on how to care for the city of his mind. Then two body
goddesses, Dharma padma śrī kuśalā and Hrī śrī mañjari prabhāvā, appear to
him, praising Māyādevī and shining on Sudhana light that brings him
realizations. He then meets a rākṣasa guardian of the meeting hall of
bodhisattvas, who teaches him two sets of ten qualities related to
kalyāṇamitras. Sudhana sees before him a gigantic lotus, in the center of
which is a kūṭāgāra, within which is Māyādevī, who can appear anywhere to
any being in various forms. He bows down with multiple bodies to her
multiple forms and enters samādhi. Then he asks her for instruction. She
describes the miraculous coming of the Buddha to her womb, and how
bodhisattvas and deities also entered it to make offerings to the Buddha.
Māyādevī explains that she has attained the liberation called the illusory
conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer and is therefore a mother to all
buddhas everywhere in the past, present, and future. She lists a great
number of the names of the buddhas of this kalpa. Sudhana asks when she
attained this liberation, and she describes being a bodhimaṇḍa goddess who
prayed to the buddha of that time to always have the cakravartin of that time
as her son. For countless lifetimes in various existences this was so, and now
he has attained enlightenment as the Buddha Vairocana. But she states that
she is limited to knowledge of this liberation and tells him to go to the
Trāyastriṃśa paradise to ask for instruction from the goddess Surendrābhā.
Chapter 45: Surendrābhā
i. 110
In this short chapter, Sudhana comes to the Trāyastriṃśa paradise, and
Surendrābhā tells him she has attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
display of pure, unimpeded memory. This enables her to remember serving
countless 
buddhas 
throughout 
countless 
kalpas, 
from 
their 
first
development of the aspiration to enlightenment until the time their Dharma
ceases. Saying that her knowledge is limited to this liberation, she tells
Sudhana to go to Kapilavastu to the teacher of children named Viśvāmitra.
Chapter 46: Viśvāmitra
i. 111
In the sūtra’s shortest chapter, Sudhana descends from the Trāyastriṃśa
paradise to Kapilavastu, where Viśvāmitra, a teacher of children, simply
instructs him to go to see Śilpābhijña in the same town.
Chapter 47: Śilpābhijña


---

i. 112
Śilpābhijña tells Sudhana that he has attained the bodhisattva liberation
called higher knowledge of the arts and describes the various realizations of the
perfection of wisdom he has attained through reciting the letters of the
Arapacana alphabet. Stating that his realization is limited, he tells Sudhana to
go to see Bhadrottamā in the town of Vartanaka in Magadha.
Chapter 48: Bhadrottamā
i. 113
Sudhana meets Bhadrottamā, described simply as a kalyāṇamitra. She states
that she has attained the samādhi called unimpeded, through which she has
unimpeded senses and other attributes of omniscience. Stating that she is
limited to this samādhi, she instructs Sudhana to go to South India to meet
the goldsmith Muktāsāra.
Chapter 49: Muktāsāra
i. 114
In this brief chapter, Sudhana meets the goldsmith Muktāsāra in the
southern town of Bharukaccha. Muktāsāra says he has attained the
bodhisattva liberation called the display of pure unimpeded memory and
continuously seeks the Dharma at the feet of the tathāgatas in the ten
directions. As his attainment is limited to this, he instructs Sudhana to go see
the householder Sucandra in the forest outside the town.
Chapter 50: Sucandra
i. 115
In this brief chapter, Sudhana meets Sucandra, who tells him his attainment
is limited to the bodhisattva liberation called the stainless light of wisdom and so
he should go to Ajitasena in the town of Roruka.
Chapter 51: Ajitasena
i. 116
In this brief chapter, Sudhana meets Ajitasena, who has attained a
bodhisattva liberation called unceasing characteristics. He tells Sudhana to go
to the brahmin Śivarāgra in the village of Dharma.
Chapter 52: Śivarāgra
i. 117
In this brief chapter, Sudhana meets the brahmin Śivarāgra, who has attained
the power of the speech of truth that fulfills wishes. Stating that he is limited
to this attainment, he tells Sudhana to go to the boy and girl Śrīsaṃbhava
and Śrīmati.


---

Chapter 53: Śrīsaṃbhava and Śrīmati
i. 118
Sudhana meets the boy and girl Śrīsaṃbhava and Śrīmati. Together, in one
voice, they say they have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
appearance of illusion, through which they see all phenomena as illusions. As
they are limited to this attainment, they tell Sudhana to go to a kūṭāgāra in
South India in which dwells the bodhisattva Maitreya. They describe the
qualities of Maitreya and give Sudhana advice on his practice of bodhisattva
conduct, describing at length the qualities that a bodhisattva needs to attain.
They also admonish him to be devoted to kalyāṇamitras, describing at length
their central importance for the bodhisattva path as the source of all its
qualities. They describe the nature of the kalyāṇamitras and use analogies in
doing so. They also use analogies to describe how a bodhisattva should
perceive a kalyāṇamitra, including the now well-known analogy of the
bodhisattva being a patient, the kalyāṇamitra being a doctor, their
instructions being medicine, and their practice being the treatment that cures
illness. They describe through analogies the benefits that come from
following this path and conclude by emphasizing that all of them are
dependent on relying upon the kalyāṇamitras. Sudhana then takes his leave.
Chapter 54: Maitreya
i. 119
Sudhana, in a state of great spiritual attainment, prostrates at the door of the
kūṭāgāra called Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha and then circumambulates it
many hundreds of thousands of times. He lists first in prose and then in
verse the many inconceivable qualities of the bodhisattvas who have this
kūṭāgāra as their residence. Then he sees Maitreya arriving with a vast
retinue. Maitreya welcomes him in verse, praising him, describing his
motivation for coming there, and giving him instruction. In response to
Sudhana’s request and praise, he teaches him at length in prose, describing
and praising the aspiration to enlightenment using a series of analogies. He
then instructs Sudhana to enter the kūṭāgāra and miraculously opens the
door by snapping his fingers. There follows a detailed description of the
inconceivable, vast sights that Sudhana sees within a state of samādhi,
including other kūṭāgāras, billions of worlds, and bodhisattvas. Then
Maitreya enters and states that this was a bodhisattva liberation called the
essence of the display of the unfailing memory that engages with the knowledge of all
objects of perception in the three times. He then describes the profound nature of
bodhisattvas and their qualities, and he states that after he dies, he will be
reborn in the Tuṣita paradise and then come to this world to be a buddha. He


---

then instructs Sudhana to go to see Mañjuśrī once more, as he has set
Sudhana upon this path and Sudhana has been connected to Mañjuśrī in all
his previous lifetimes of following the path.
Chapter 55: Mañjuśrī
i. 120
Sudhana passes through a hundred and ten towns until he reaches a district
called Sumanāmukha. Mañjuśrī is far away —a hundred and ten yojanas —
but reaches out his hand and places it on Sudhana’s head and praises him,
teaches him, and blesses him, so that Sudhana gains many attainments.
Chapter 56: Samanta bhadra and “The Prayer for Completely
Good Conduct”
i. 121
Sudhana has great realization and roots of merit, and therefore ten events
and ten lights that are omens of the appearance of Samanta bhadra occur.
Sudhana sees Samanta bhadra seated before the Buddha, and he sees a
variety of miraculous events manifesting from Samanta bhadra’s pores and
Samanta bhadra’s activities in countless realms and throughout time. As a
result, he attains ten practices of the perfection of knowledge. Then Samanta-
bhadra and all those Samanta bhadras before every buddha place their hands
on Sudhana’s head, and he gains great attainments. Samanta bhadra
describes his own past practices, such as generosity. He instructs Sudhana
to look at his body, and Sudhana sees vast visions within each of Samanta-
bhadra’s pores. Then Samanta bhadra recites “The Prayer for Completely
Good Conduct,” and the sūtra ends.

aspirations of beings, [F.277.a] whose sight was free from defect because
they knew that the realm of beings has no souls and no beings, and who had
wisdom  as vast as space because they pervaded the realm of phenomena
with a network of light rays.
66
1. 2
There were five hundred śrāvakas endowed with miraculous powers, all
of whom had realized the nature of the way of the truths; directly perceived
the true finality; comprehended the nature of phenomena; transcended the
ocean of existence; had the range of activity of the tathāgatas that is as
extensive as space;  had ended fetters, predispositions, and bondage;
remained in an unobstructed state; dwelled in a peace that was like space;
had eliminated doubts, uncertainty, and equivocation concerning the
buddhas; and followed the path of aspiration for the ocean of the wisdom of
the buddhas. There were lords of the world who had served previous jinas,
who were dedicated to bringing benefit and happiness to all beings, who
became good guides without being asked, who were dedicated to protecting
other beings, who had attained the gateway  to wisdom that transcends the
world, who had the motivation of never abandoning all beings, who had
originated from  the field of activity of the teaching of all buddhas, who
were dedicated to protecting the teachings of the tathāgatas, who were born
through prayers to be within the family of the buddhas, who had attained
being within the family lineage of the tathāgatas, and who aspired to
omniscience.

Then those bodhisattvas and their followers, and the śrāvakas who had
miraculous powers [F.277.b] and the lords of the world and their followers
thought, “Without the Tathāgata’s blessing, without the Tathāgata’s
manifestations, without the Tathāgata’s power, without the Tathāgata’s past
prayers, without a past excellent practice of the roots of merit, without the
guidance of a kalyāṇamitra, without the pure eyes of faith, without the
attainment of the radiance of a vast aspiration, without the pure superior
motivation of a bodhisattva, and without the determined aspiration for
omniscience, it is not possible for worldly beings and devas to comprehend,
or understand, or believe in, or know, or conceive of, or grasp, or analyze, or
meditate on, or classify, or reveal, or describe, or establish within other
beings the Tathāgata’s domain, the scope of the Tathāgata’s wisdom, the
Tathāgata’s

Tathāgata’s

Then the Bhagavat, knowing the thoughts in the minds of those
bodhisattvas, rested in the samādhi called the gaping lion, which is as

that appear to all beings,  has the nature of being the gateway to great
compassion, possesses the gateway to great compassion, precedes great

As soon as the Bhagavat rested in that meditation, there appeared a
kūṭāgāra that was greatly adorned and so vast that it had no end or center,
with invincible vajra banners arranged on the ground, arrayed in networks
of all kings of precious jewels, filled with petals of flowers made of many
jewels, [F.279.a] beautified by pillars of beryl, with kings of jewels as an
arranged display of ornaments that illuminated the world, having a
multitude of excellent jewels,  having heaps of precious jewels from the
Jambu River, with porches, toraṇas, pinnacles, and windows made of all
jewels, adorned by countless pure balconies, with an array of precious jewels
that resembled all the lords of worlds, with arrangements of the precious
jewels from the world’s  oceans, covered with nets of all precious jewels,
with upraised parasols and banners, and beautified by gateways and toraṇas
emitting light rays that completely filled the realm of phenomena; the
external ground was beautified by indescribable daises for the surrounding

Through the power of the Buddha, there were present buddha realms, to
the number of the atoms in countless buddha realms, that were immense and
vast in length and breadth, possessed various adornments made of all
jewels, had grounds made of an indescribable variety of precious jewels,
were encircled by walls of countless precious jewels, and were adorned by
lines of palm trees made of various jewels.
1. 9
Those buddha realms were adorned by immeasurable rivers of scented
water that were filled with an unceasing volume of scented water that was
mixed with many flowers made of a variety of jewels, flowing and turning to
the right, and resounding with descriptions of all the qualities of
buddhahood. [F.279.b]
1. 10
There were rows of precious white lotus flowers, precious trees beautifully
adorned by the blossoms of superior lotuses made from all jewels, rows of
countless kūṭāgāras made of various jewels covered in shining networks of
every kind of precious jewel, countless aerial palaces made of precious
jewels adorned with all precious jewels, the aroma of countless incenses
spread everywhere, and the adornment of clouds of incense, countless
banners of jewels, banners of cloth, banners that were flags, banners with
streamers of jewels, banners with flowers, banners with adornments,
banners with garlands, banners with bells of various jewels, banners that
were parasols of kings  of jewels, banners of precious jewels with
pervading radiance, banners of kings of precious jewels that resounded with

the wheel of the names of all the tathāgatas, banners of delightful lions made
of the kings of precious jewels, banners of the kings of precious jewels that
proclaimed the past practices of all the tathāgatas, and banners of the kings
of precious jewels that illuminated the entire realm of phenomena, and all
directions were adorned with every kind of adorning banner.
1. 11
Clouds of countless aerial palaces of devas adorned the entire expanse of
the sky above Jetavana. Jetavana was adorned and covered by a cloud of
countless trees of various kinds of incense. [F.280.a] It was adorned and
encircled by Sumeru Mountains that possessed indescribable adornments. It
was adorned by the beautiful voices and sounds of the praises of all
tathāgatas that came from indescribable clouds of musical instruments being
played and beaten. It was adorned by a covering of clouds of indescribable
precious lotuses. There were indescribable precious lion thrones on which
were precious cushions made of divine materials, on which the bodhisattvas
were seated, and which were adorned by clouds that emitted beautiful
voices that praised the tathāgatas. It was adorned by clouds of grains that
were precious jewels that formed indescribable images of lords of the
worlds. It was adorned by indescribable clouds of networks of white pearls.
It was adorned by a covering of indescribable clouds of kūṭāgāras made of
red pearls. It was adorned by an indescribable rainfall from clouds of pearls
that were as hard as vajras.
1. 12
Why was this? It was because of the inconceivable roots of merit of a
tathāgata. It was because of the inconceivable good qualities of a tathāgata.
It was because of the inconceivable sovereign power and blessing of a
tathāgata. It was because of a tathāgata’s inconceivable miraculous
manifestations whereby his one body could pervade all world realms. It was
because of the inconceivable display of the spiritual power through which
all the tathāgatas could enter one body that appears throughout the entire
array of buddha realms. It was because of the inconceivable manifestations
of the tathāgatas through which they can show the perceivable image of the
entire realm of phenomena within a single atom. [F.280.b] It was because of
the inconceivable manifestations of the tathāgatas through which they can
show the entire succession of tathāgatas of the past within a single pore. It
was because of the tathāgatas’ inconceivable ability to illuminate infinite
world realms with a single ray of light. It was because of the tathāgatas’
inconceivable ability to pervade all buddha realms, which are as numerous
as the atoms that comprise all world realms, with a cloud of emanations from
a single body hair. It was because of the tathāgatas’ inconceivable ability to
reveal the kalpas of the creation and destruction of world realms from a
single body hair.

Just as Jetavana was in this way a buddha realm and was completely
purified by being a pure realm, in that same way the world realms in the ten
directions to the limits of the realm of phenomena, to the limits of space,
were also completely purified, adorned, beautified, and with emanated
bodies of tathāgatas, and had become similar to Jetavana. They were filled

signs and features of a great being, all his pores, his entire body, all his
limbs, his fingers and toes, the words he spoke, and his robe and his skirt he
revealed, within all his signs and features of a great being, [F.288.b] all his
pores, his entire body, all his limbs, his fingers and toes, the words he spoke,
and his robe and his skirt, the images of an ocean of the past practice of
engaging in the perfection of generosity, and all the recipients and the
gifts
 of all of the assemblies of bodhisattvas, of himself, of the Bhagavat
Vairocana, of all the tathāgatas throughout the past, of all prophesied and
unprophesied tathāgatas throughout the future who have yet to come, and
of all who in the present reside in infinite buddha realms in the ten
directions. He made visible the images of an ocean of the entire past practice
of engaging in the perfection of correct conduct. He made visible the images
of an ocean of the past practice of engaging in the perfection of patience
through his limbs, his fingers, and his toes being cut off. He made visible the
images of an ocean of the past practice of the diligence, vehemence, and
prowess of all bodhisattvas. He made visible the images of an ocean of the
past practice of seeking the dhyāna of all the tathāgatas. He revealed the
images of an ocean of the past practices of engaging in perfecting the way of
the Dharma wheel of all the tathāgatas, and he revealed the bodies and faces
of those seeking the Dharma with great resolve giving away all possessions.
He revealed the appearances of an ocean of the past practices of rejoicing in
seeing all the tathāgatas, the path of all bodhisattvas, and bringing
illumination
 to all beings. He revealed the appearances of an ocean of the
past practices of the fulfillment of an ocean of prayers by all bodhisattvas
through which there is a display
 of perfect purification. He revealed the
appearances of an ocean of the past practice of engaging in the
accomplishment, prowess, and purification of the perfection of strength of all
bodhisattvas. Filling the vast expanse of the realm of phenomena with
clouds of all miraculous manifestation, [F.289.a] he revealed the appearances
of an ocean of the past practice endowed with the domain of the wisdom of
all bodhisattvas.
111

1. 32
He approached the Bhagavat, bowed to the Bhagavat, and in the upward
direction emanated kūṭāgāras that were adorned by all kinds of lords of
vajras, each having in its center a lotus of sapphires upon a lion throne. He
and his entourage, their blessed bodies adorned by a network of all shining
precious kings of jewels and hung with necklaces of the kings of jewels from


---

which sounded the names of the tathāgatas of the three times, and their
heads bound by precious turbans, seated themselves cross-legged upon the
lotuses. [B25]
1. 33
All those bodhisattvas and their entourages had become so through the
completely good conduct and prayer of bodhisattvas. They had been at the
feet of all tathāgatas and gazed upon their faces. They possessed the
completely pure eyes of wisdom. The ocean of the teaching of the way of the
sūtras and the wheel of the Dharma of all the tathāgatas had entered their
ears. They had perfectly perfected the perfections that bring the attainment
of the power of all bodhisattvas. In each instant they manifested the miracle
of going into the presence of all tathāgatas. They had the range of pervading
all worlds with a single body. They manifested the appearance of their
bodies being present in the assemblies of the pupils of all tathāgatas.
[F.289.b] They had the range of activity of manifesting all worlds being
included within one world that is within a single atom. They ripened all
beings, being present at the exact time for guiding them. They had the range
of activity of emitting from all their pores the thunder of the clouds of the
Dharma wheel of all the tathāgatas. They had attained the knowledge that all
the realms of beings were like magical tricks. They had realized that all the
tathāgatas are like illusions. They were purified by the knowledge that all
rebirths within the continuation of existence were like dreams. They knew
that all accomplishments of wisdom are like mirages. They had realized that
all infinite worlds are like illusory manifestations. They had attained the ten
strengths of the tathāgatas and the light of wisdom. They were supreme
beings of fearlessness and had the forcefulness of the lion’s roar. They had
entered the inexhaustible ocean of unique knowledge. They had obtained
the ocean of the languages of beings and the wisdom of the meaning of the
words of the Dharma. They possessed an unimpeded scope of wisdom that
was as vast as the realm of phenomena and space. They possessed the pure
domain of the wisdom of the clairvoyances of all bodhisattvas. They
possessed the diligence that disrupts the domain of all the māras. They were
established in the power of knowing the three times. They had attained the
unobscured wisdom of all phenomena. They had the field of activity of space
without any base. They had everlasting
 omniscience. They had diligence
as vast as space.
 They had the range of wisdom that did not focus on all
existences as its object. [F.290.a] They had the pervading wisdom
 of the
ocean of processes of the entire realm of phenomena. They had entered
through the gateway of the nondifferentiating wisdom of all world realms.
They demonstrated the miracle of all the worlds being connected, one with
the other. They demonstrated bodies that were born in all kinds of world
realms. They had the knowledge of the small and vast, wide and narrow
114
115
116


---

shapes of all world realms. They had realized the wisdom of the small being
the vast. They had the knowledge of the vast being the small. They had
attained being in the presence of all buddhas in a single instant of mind.
They possessed bodies that had been blessed by all the tathāgatas. They had
attained the ignorance-free wisdom in all the oceans of the directions. They
pervaded all the oceans of the directions with emanations in an instant of
mind.
1. 34
These bodhisattvas who all had such limitless qualities through the
blessings of the tathāgatas filled the entirety of Jetavana.
1. 35
The great śrāvakas, such as Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana, Mahākāśyapa,
Revata, Subhūti, Aniruddha, Nandika, Kapphiṇa,
 Kātyāyana, and Pūrṇa
Maitrāyaṇī putra, were present in Jetavana but did not see those miraculous
manifestations of the Tathāgata. Neither did they see the miraculous
displays of the Buddha, the majesty
 of the Buddha, the manifestations of
the Buddha, the miracles of the Buddha, the supremacy of the Buddha, the
miraculous conduct
 of the Buddha, the power of the Buddha, the blessing
of the Buddha, or the pure realm of the Buddha.
117
118
119
1. 36
Nor did they see the inconceivable range of activity of the bodhisattvas,
[F.290.b] the coming of the bodhisattvas, the arrival of the bodhisattvas, the
gathering of the bodhisattvas, the approach of the displays of paranormal
powers of the bodhisattvas, the circle of the assembly of bodhisattvas, the
bodhisattvas arranging themselves in the directions, the display of the lion
thrones of the bodhisattvas, the dwellings of the bodhisattvas, the activities
of the bodhisattvas, the display of the power of the samādhis of the
bodhisattvas, the gaze of the bodhisattvas, the awesomeness of the
bodhisattvas, the forcefulness of the bodhisattvas, the offerings made to the
Tathāgata by the bodhisattvas, the prophecies given to the bodhisattvas, the
ripening of the bodhisattvas, the renunciation
 of the bodhisattvas, the
purified Dharma bodies of the bodhisattvas, the fulfilled wisdom bodies of
the bodhisattvas, the proclaimed
 aspiration bodies of the bodhisattvas, the
created form bodies of the bodhisattvas, the pure, perfect features of the
bodhisattvas, the display of the auras of infinite colors of the bodhisattvas,
the network of light rays emanated by the bodhisattvas, the spreading
clouds emanated by the bodhisattvas, or the network of the directions being
pervaded by the bodhisattvas, nor did they see the miraculous realm of the
conduct of the bodhisattvas.
120
121
1. 37
Why was that? Because they did not have the same roots of merit. They
had not accumulated in the past the roots of merit that are the cause for
seeing the miracles of a buddha; [F.291.a] they had not in the past taught the
qualities and pure display of the buddha realms included within the world
realms in the ten directions; they had not described the buddha miracles of


---

the buddha bhagavats; and they had not in the past encouraged beings
continuing in saṃsāra to attain the highest, complete enlightenment. They
had not established in the minds of others the aspiration to enlightenment;
they had not engaged in preventing the discontinuation of the family
lineage of the tathāgatas; they did not have the diligence to gather all beings
as pupils; they did not encourage bodhisattvas to practice the perfections;
and when they were continuing in saṃsāra, they did not have as their goal
the level of wisdom that transcends that of all beings.
1. 38
They had not accumulated the roots of merit to become omniscient. They
had not accomplished the roots of merit of a tathāgata who transcends the
world. They had not realized the clairvoyance that perceives the miracles in
all the pure realms of the buddhas. They did not know the roots of merit from
focusing upon the exceptional enlightenment that transcends the world,
which is perceived by the vision of the bodhisattvas and originates from the
great aspirations of the bodhisattvas.
1. 39
Nor did all the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas know the exceptional
perception of the vision of the wisdom eyes of the completely good
bodhisattvas. Nor did they know the attainments
 of the bodhisattvas
through the illusory nature of phenomena, which arise from the blessing of
the tathāgatas;
 or the blessing of possessing the various dream-like
perceptions of bodhisattvas; [F.291.b] or the increasing great power of the joy
of bodhisattvas.
122
123
124
1. 40
Therefore, the great śrāvakas, such as the supreme pair, the excellent
pair,
 and so on, did not see the miracles of the Tathāgata; they did not hear
of them, did not know them, did not comprehend them, did not understand
them, were not aware of them, did not believe in them, did not think of them,
did not regard them, did not consider them, did not dwell upon them, and
did not reflect upon them.
125
1. 41
Why was that? Because the scope of a buddha’s wisdom
 is not the same
as that of the śrāvaka. Therefore, even though the great śrāvakas were
present in Jetavana, they did not see the Buddha’s miracles. They did not
have the roots of merit that would accord with that. They did not have the
pure vision for seeing the Buddha’s miracles. They did not have the samādhi
that realizes the power for causing something vast to be within a small object
of perception. They did not have the liberation, the miraculous powers, the
supremacy, the power, the mastery, the state, the perception, the vision, or
the wisdom [F.292.a] through which they could know, see, comprehend,
understand, fathom, realize, view, experience, grasp, surmount, hear from
others, teach, describe, reveal, praise, bestow, inspire beings toward, connect
beings with, bring beings to, or establish beings in the nature of the
Buddha’s miracles.
126


---

1. 42
Why was that? Because they had become what they were through the
Śrāvakayāna, had accomplished the path of the śrāvakas, had fulfilled the
range of the conduct of the śrāvakas, had gained the result of the śrāvakas,
had gained the knowledge of the illumination of the truths, were established
in the summit of existence, had attained absolute peace, had minds that were
devoid of great compassion, had no regard for all the world realms, and had
accomplished their own benefit.
1. 43
They had gathered and were present in Jetavana before, to the left, to the
right, and to the rear of the Bhagavat, but they did not see those miracles of
the Buddha.
1. 44
Why was that? They had not attained omniscient wisdom; they had not
accomplished omniscient wisdom; they were not established in omniscient
wisdom; they had not prayed for omniscient wisdom; they had not realized
omniscient wisdom; they had not become imbued with omniscient wisdom;
and they had not become purified in omniscient wisdom and therefore were
not able to observe, to know, to see, or to realize the miracles from the
Buddha’s samādhi.
1. 45
Why was that? Because they could be seen through the vision of those
who were in the family of bodhisattvas and not through the vision of
śrāvakas. Therefore, those great śrāvakas were present in Jetavana but did
not see the Tathāgata’s miracles, the Tathāgata’s power, the Tathāgata’s
pure realm, or the gathering of the bodhisattvas. [F.292.b]
1. 46
By analogy, many hundreds of thousands of pretas, suffering from thirst
and hunger, naked, without clothing, their skin the color of being burned,
shriveled by the wind and sun, attacked by flocks of crows, and terrified by
wolves and jackals,
 do not see the great Ganges River even though they
are gathered on its opposite banks, because they are obscured by obscuring
karma. Some of them see a dry riverbed without water, and some of them see
it filled with ashes. In that same way, although the sthaviras, the great
śrāvakas, were present in Jetavana, their vision was obscured by the
cataracts of the ignorance that is contrary to omniscience. And this is
because they did not possess the power of the root of merit of the level of
omniscience.
127
1. 47
By analogy, a man who is in the middle of a great gathering of many
people becomes drowsy. He falls asleep, and in a dream he sees in that place
the divine city that is Śakra’s beautiful residence, which is upon the summit
of Sumeru and has trees; is encircled by a wall of fruit trees;
 is filled with a
quintillion female devas and filled with a quintillion male devas; has wish-
fulfilling trees that emit divine clothing, strings of pearls, precious
ornaments, and various kinds of necklaces; has many trees of musical
instruments that emit beautiful music when the divine instruments of
128


---

various kinds are moved by the breezes; and has an array of all kinds of
joyful amusements. He hears the melodious, beautiful sounds made by the
female devas who are singing and playing the divine musical instruments,
and he thinks that he is there. [F.293.a] Even though he sees that everywhere
this place is adorned by an array of divine things, the many people who are
gathered in that same place do not see it, do not know it, and do not perceive
it. Why is that? Because it is perceived in a dream by the man who is asleep.
Although those many people are in the same place, they do not see it.
1. 48
In the same way, those bodhisattvas, those lords of the world who aspire
to enlightenment, who had received the vast blessing of the Buddha, who
had obtained the unmistaken power of their roots of merit, who had made
prayers of aspiration for omniscience, who understood well all the qualities
of the tathāgatas, who were well established in the vast array of the
bodhisattva path, and who were highly accomplished in the Dharma of the
aspects 
of 
omniscient 
wisdom
 —they 
had 
completely 
excellent
bodhisattva conduct, had the pure fulfillment of their prayers of aspiration,
had reached the domain of wisdom of all the bodhisattva levels, enjoyed all
practices through bodhisattva samādhi, and practiced without impediment
the entire range of bodhisattva wisdom, so that they could see, perceive, and
experience the inconceivable supremacy of the Buddha and the displays of
the Buddha. However, the great śrāvakas, the supreme pair, the good pair,
and so on did not see them or know of them, because they did not have the
vision of the bodhisattvas.
129
1. 49
By analogy, the Himalaya, the king of mountains, [F.293.b] is filled with
places that are the sources of herbs. Those individuals who have acquired
the knowledge of mantras, medicine, and herbs and are accomplished in that
science,
 and who are learned in the usage of all herbs, carry out there the
task of collecting those herbs. Others who dwell on that king of mountains
and who are herders of animals, cattle, goats, and sheep; those who are
hunters; and other people who do not know the science of herbs do not
know the taste, power, effects, locations, usages, and application of herbs. In
the same way, the bodhisattvas who perceive
 the range of activity of the
Tathāgata, who have perfected
 the range of bodhisattva miracles, can
see
 the range of miracles of the Tathāgata’s samādhi. The great śrāvakas,
the supreme pair, the good pair, and others who were content concerning
what had to be done for themselves, who were indifferent concerning what
had to be done for others, who were uncaring —although they were present
in Jetavana, they did not perceive the range of miracles of the Tathāgata’s
samādhi.
130
131
132
133

1. 50
For example, this great earth is the perfect source of all jewels. It is filled
with many hundreds of thousands of treasures. It is completely filled with
different kinds of various jewels. A man who is skilled in the knowledge of
the sources
 of jewels and treasure, is educated in the science of examining
jewels, has knowledge of the science of treasures, is well trained in the craft
of jewelry,
 and is supported by the power of vast merit will obtain
whatever jewels he desires, and he will completely satisfy himself, support
his father and mother, care for his sons and daughters, and also distribute
his wealth among other beings who are old, sick, poor, suffering misfortune,
or in need of food and clothes, [F.294.a] bringing others various kinds of
happiness from wealth. However, those beings who have no knowledge of
treasures or the source of jewels and who have not created merit do not have
the pure vision of the knowledge of jewels. Even though they are at the very
location, they do not perceive that there is precious treasure and a source of
jewels, and without that knowledge they do not obtain jewels, nor do they
make use of the jewels.
134
135
1. 51
In the same way, the bodhisattvas had the pure vision of wisdom
concerning the inconceivable range of the Tathāgata, and they perceived the
inconceivable range of the wisdom of the Tathāgata. They were present in
Jetavana and saw the miracles of the Buddha, perceived an ocean of the
ways of the Dharma, had applied the seal of samādhi, were engaged in
making offerings to the Tathāgata, were dedicated to possessing the
Dharma, and gathered beings through the four methods of gathering pupils.
The great śrāvakas did not see those miracles of the Tathāgata or that
gathering of the great assembly of bodhisattvas.
1. 52
By analogy, a man who is blindfolded arrives at an island of jewels. He
walks around that island of jewels, stands on it, sits on it, and lies down on
it, but he does not see that source of jewels. He does not see the trees of
jewels, the clothing of jewels, the incense of jewels, or all the jewels. He does
not know the scope, the value, or the use of those jewels. He does not
acquire the jewels. He does not understand what could be done with the
jewels. Those who are not blindfolded see and know all those jewels.
[F.294.b]
1. 53
In the same way, the bodhisattvas had reached the island of the jewels of
the Dharma and saw before them the supreme jewel of the Tathāgata, the
adornment of the entire world, present in Jetavana and demonstrating the
inconceivable miracles of a buddha. The great śrāvakas were present,
staying at the feet of the Tathāgata, but did not see manifested miracles from
the range of the Tathāgata’s samādhi. They did not see the great assembly of
the bodhisattvas who were like a source of jewels. Why was that? Because
their eyes of wisdom were blindfolded by the ignorance that is contrary to


---

omniscience. They did not have the purified eyes of wisdom of the
bodhisattvas, and they had not realized the comprehension of the lineage of
the Dharma’s domain, through which one could see the inconceivable
manifestation of miracles from the supremacy of the Tathāgata’s samādhi.136
1. 54
By analogy, there is the completely purified sight called stainless brilliance,
which does not experience any darkness. If a man who has obtained that
purified sight named stainless brilliance were to go in the completely black
darkness of a dark night among a gathering of a quintillion people who have
various
 practices and conduct and whose sight is overwhelmed by
darkness, he would move, stand, sit down,
 and act among them in various
ways, but those people will not see or know of that man’s various kinds of
activity. [F.295.a] However, when that man looks in the different directions at
the various practices and conduct that the great gathering of beings is
performing, he sees their various shapes, their various colors, with none of
those various sights unseen. In the same way, the Tathāgata, who has an
entourage of an assembly of bodhisattvas, possesses the sight that is pure
and unimpeded so that he sees and knows the entire world. He
demonstrates the manifestation of the great miracles of a buddha’s samādhi,
but the great śrāvakas do not see those great miracles manifested by the
samādhi and wisdom of the Tathāgata. Nor do they see that great assembly
of the great bodhisattvas.
137
138
1. 55
By analogy, it is like when a bhikṣu in the center of an assembly of many
beings rests in the samādhi of the pervasion of earth or rests in the samādhi
pervaded by water or the samādhi pervaded by fire, pervaded by air,
pervaded by blue, pervaded by yellow, pervaded by red, pervaded by white,
pervaded by devas, pervaded by the bodies
 of various beings, pervaded
by all sounds and voices, or pervaded by all perceptions. That assembly of
many beings does not see a mass of water, does not see the light of fire, does
not see the pervasion by the bodies of various beings, and so on up to not
seeing the pervasion by all perceptions. It only sees him practicing and
resting in the samādhis. In the same way, when the Tathāgata manifests
inconceivable miracles that are the range of a buddha’s samādhi, the great
śrāvakas do not see or know them. [F.295.b] The bodhisattvas who are
following the path of the tathāgatas see and comprehend that range of
activity of the tathāgatas.
139
1. 56
For example, as soon as a man who creates ointments smears it on his two
eyes, an entire multitude of beings cannot see his body, but he can see the
bodies of the entire multitude of beings. Whether he is walking, sitting, or
standing, he sees the entire multitude of beings. In that same way, the
Tathāgata has transcended the world, has passed beyond the range of


---

perception of all beings, and has attained the range of omniscient wisdom
but can be perceived by the vision of the wisdom of the bodhisattvas. He can
see all beings, but the great śrāvakas do not see the miracle of the Tathāgata.
1. 57
For example, a deity who accompanies a human for his entire life is always
following him. The deity sees the human, but the human does not see the
deity. In the same way, the Tathāgata has attained the range of perception of
the wisdom of omniscience, and he manifests miracles in the middle of the
great gathering of the assembly of bodhisattvas, but the great śrāvakas do
not see and do not know of the Tathāgata’s great manifestation of miracles
or the miracle of the assembled circle of bodhisattvas.
1. 58
Consider, for example, a bhikṣu who has reached the perfection of power
over his entire mind
 and rests in a meditation in which all perception and
sensation has ceased. Through his being without perception
 or sensation,
his six senses do not experience anything. He has not attained nirvāṇa, and
worldly events are continuing and present, but through the power and
might of being in that meditation, he does not perceive them and does not
see them. In the same way, [F.296.a] the great śrāvakas were present in
Jetavana, and they had all the six sensory faculties, but they did not see, did
not perceive, and did not know of the manifestation of miracles and
supremacy from the samādhi of the Tathāgata. Why is that? The range of
activity of the Buddha is profound, vast, immeasurable, difficult to see, and
difficult to understand. The Buddha’s range of activity is inconceivable and
is inaccessible to the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas. Therefore, the great
śrāvakas were assembled in Jetavana and were present at the feet of the
Bhagavat, but they did not see the Buddha’s miracles or the great gathering
of bodhisattvas. They also did not see or perceive the accumulation in
Jetavana of the qualities and adornments of countless, innumerable pure
world realms, because they were not worthy of it.
140
141
1. 59
At that time, the bodhisattva Vairocana praṇidhāna nābhi raśmi prabha
recited these verses:
1. 60
“See the inconceivable enlightenment,
The buddhahood of the supreme being!
The Jina has manifested the miracles
Of a buddha in this Jetadhvaja. {1}
1. 61
“There appears the self-arising,
Incalculable power of transformation
That the world, not knowing the way
Of the Dharma, is ignorant of. {2}
1. 62
“There are the profound,
Immeasurable, inconceivable


---

Miracles of the Dharma kings
That the world does not fathom. {3} [F.296.b]
1. 63
“The buddhas have infinite splendor142
And are adorned by characteristics.
The Dharmas that the buddhas produce
Are without characteristics. {4}
1. 64
“In the grove that is named Jeta
The Jina demonstrates miracles
That are without center or edge
And difficult to describe in words. {5}
1. 65
“See the assembly of great beings,
Of bodhisattvas, who have assembled
From countless millions of realms
Wishing to look upon the Jina.
 {6}
143
1. 66
“The entire world is unable
To know or think of that
Fulfillment of prayers
And that unimpeded conduct. {7}
1. 67
“The pratyeka buddhas
And the śrāvakas do not know
Anything about their conduct
Or the range of
 their minds. {8}
144
1. 68
“Those with great wisdom, the bodhisattvas,
Are invincible and undefeatable,145
Banners of heroism, unadulterated,
And they have reached the level of wisdom. {9}
1. 69
“They have great renown
And have attained immeasurable samādhis.
They demonstrate miracles that pervade
The entire domain of phenomena.” {10}
1. 70
Then the bodhisattva Duryodhana vīrya vega rāja, through the blessing of the
Buddha, looked into the ten directions and recited these verses:
1. 71
“See those who are born from the sugatas,
They who bring happiness to the world,
Who have the essence of merit, great wisdom,
And who have realized the conduct of a bodhisattva. {11}


---

1. 72
“They are learned, with infinite knowledge.
Their minds are in a perfect state of meditation.
They have the range of a vast wisdom
That is profound and without center or limit. {12}
1. 73
“See the numerous oceans
Of they who have no dwelling, no basis,
Who are assembled from the ten directions
And seated upon lotus seats {13}146
1. 74
“In the great forest named Jeta
That is beautified by many adornments,
That is completely filled with bodhisattvas
And is the hermitage of the Sugata. {14} [F.297.a]
1. 75
“They are without basis, without acquisition,
Without elaboration, without foundation,
With unimpeded minds, stainless,
Focused on the essence of phenomena. {15}
1. 76
“They are banners of wisdom,
Great heroes who have vajra minds.
They are unshakable and teach nirvāṇa
Within unceasing qualities.
 {16}
147
1. 77
“They have gathered from numerous millions
Of realms beyond number in the ten directions
And have arrived before the Buddha
And are free from dualistic perception. {17}
1. 78
“They see these miracles
Of the self-arisen Lion of the Śākyas,
And it is through his blessing
That these bodhisattvas have gathered. {18}
1. 79
“The offspring of the jinas, they who have attained perfection,
Do not distinguish between the Buddha’s Dharmas
On the level of the essence of phenomena
But make distinctions merely in terms of terminology. {19}
1. 80
“They are established in the ultimate conclusion
Of the indivisibility of the essence of phenomena,
But they make distinctions between phenomena
Through producing unceasing words.” {20}


---

1. 81
Then the bodhisattva Samanta śrī samudgata tejorāja, through the blessing of
the Buddha, looked into the ten directions and recited these verses:
1. 82
“See the vast circle of wisdom
Of the one who is supreme among beings.
He knows when it is timely and untimely
And then teaches the Dharma to beings. {21}
1. 83
“He completely defeats all opposition
From gathered assemblies of tīrthikas.
He demonstrates miraculous acts
According to the wishes of beings. {22}
1. 84
“The Sugata does not dwell in a direction;148
The Buddha does not go to a realm.149
The great Muni is always both150
Ascertainable and unascertainable. {23} [F.297.b]
1. 85
“The sun moving through the sky
Demarcates the number of days.
Thus the Teacher, wise with knowledge,
Demarcates the three times without impediment. {24}
1. 86
“On the night of a full moon
The moon’s disk is the brightest light.
In that way, the Lord151
Full of white Dharma is seen. {25}
1. 87
“Just as the disk of the sun
Moves through the sky
Without being stopped —
Thus are the Buddha’s miracles. {26}
1. 88
“Just as space is not dependent
On the worlds in the directions,
In that way, the buddha miracles
Of the Lamp of the World are to be known. {27}
1. 89
“Just as in the world the earth
Is the support for all beings,
In that way, in the world the Dharma wheel
Of the Lamp of the World is a support. {28}

Moves swiftly through the sky,

Moves through the world realms. {29}

Are based on accumulations of water,
In that way, the buddhas of the three times
Are based on accumulations of wisdom.” {30}
1. 92
Then the bodhisattva Asaṅga śrī garbha rāja, through the blessing of the
Buddha, looked into the ten directions and recited these verses:
1. 93
“Just like high mountains and cliffs
That are made of vajras,
The Buddha, the protector of all worlds,
Is the highest in the world. {31}
1. 94
“Just as the great water of the ocean
Is immeasurable and unpolluted,

Dispels the thirst of the world. {32}

Is higher than the ocean’s water,

Is higher than the ocean of phenomena. {33}

Is the source of all jewels, [F.298.a]
The Self-Arisen One’s wisdom
Is unending instantaneous knowledge. {34}

“The Guide’s wisdom is profound,
Incalculable, and immeasurable;
Therefore, the Buddha demonstrates
Immeasurable, inconceivable miracles. {35}

“Just as a skilled magician
Manifests the qualities of illusions,
In that way, the Buddha, who has the power
Of knowledge, manifests miracles. {36}

“Just as a pure wish-fulfilling jewel
Fulfills the wishes that are made,

The pure aspirations of beings. {37}

“The entirety of the pratyeka buddhas
Free of error, who appear in the three times,
Are also without the knowledge
Of the footsteps the Protector takes. {52}

“It goes without saying that all beings,
Obscured by the darkness of ignorance
And like dogs tied to a leash,
Have no knowledge of the Guide. {53}

“The Jina cannot be known.

“The constant one has the light of the full moon,
And he is beautified
 by his features.

“One will not completely understand

Which are difficult to see, will appear

the blessing of the Buddha, looked into the ten directions and recited these
verses:

And therefore the self-arisen ones have no body.
The scope of their wisdom is inconceivable,

And bring liberation to the entire world.” {80}

Then the bodhisattva Sarvāvaraṇa vikiraṇa jñāna vikrānta rāja,

verses:

 of kalpas,

Let alone seeing a supreme one
Who eliminates all doubts. {81}

“He has gained the realization of all Dharmas.

“One will never have enough

1. 151
“The bodhisattvas
 are continually gazing
173
At the form body of the lord of humans.

“The form body of the great Muni

Chapter 2
SAMANTA BHADRA
2. 1
Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samanta bhadra looked upon the great
assembly of bodhisattvas, and in order to categorize, teach extensively,
clarify, illuminate, and give instructions on the Tathāgata’s samādhi called
the gaping lion, he taught those bodhisattvas in ten ways the Tathāgata’s
samādhi called the gaping lion through the equality of the nature of the realm
of phenomena with the element of space, the equality of the three times, the
equality of the realm of phenomena, the equality of the realms of beings, the
equality of all worlds, the equality of the continuum of karma, the equality of
the thoughts of all beings, the equality of the aspirations of beings, the
equality of the appearances of phenomena, the equality of the times for
ripening beings, and the equality of the faculties of all beings. [F.301.b]
2. 2
What were those ten ways?
1. The teaching of the entire succession of buddhas and succession of
buddha realms
 in the atoms of all the buddha realms that are included
within the entire realm of phenomena.
180
2. 3
2. The teaching of describing the qualities of a tathāgata until the end of
future kalpas in all the buddha realms to the ends of the element of space.
2. 4
3. The teaching that describes the appearance of tathāgatas in all the
buddha realms and the ocean of gateways to enlightenment that have no
middle or edge.
2. 5
4. The teaching of the saṅghas of bodhisattvas, the circles of the
assemblies of the tathāgatas, who are facing the bodhimaṇḍas
 in all the
buddha realms to the ends of the element of space.
181
2. 6
5. The teaching of emanations that are like the bodies of the buddhas of
the three times that are emanated from all the pores in one instant of mind
and pervade the realm of phenomena.


---

2. 7
6. The teaching of the ocean of buddha realms in the ocean of directions
being blessed as having the same ground and having one body pervading
them.
2. 8
7. The teaching of the power of buddha manifestations appearing on all
supporting surfaces
 in all three times.
182
2. 9
8. The teaching of the manifestations of the buddhas in the succession of
realms, as numerous as the atoms of all realms,
 throughout the three times
in an ocean of kalpas.
183
2. 10
9. The teaching of the power of an entire ocean of the prayers of the
buddhas of the three times being expressed from all pores and causing the
appearance of bodhisattvas.
2. 11
10. The teaching of the power of buddhas, lion thrones, [F.302.a]
assembled circles of bodhisattvas, the adornment of the bodhimaṇḍa, and
the turning of the different Dharma wheels being as extensive as the realm of
phenomena.
2. 12
“Oh jinaputras, the teachings on this samādhi of the gaping lion, such as
these ten teachings, are as numerous as the atoms in uncountable buddha
realms.
“Oh jinaputras, that is the field of activity of the wisdom of the
tathāgatas.”
2. 13
The bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, in order to teach an aspect of the
meaning of the Tathāgata’s samādhi of the gaping lion, through the blessing
of the Buddha looked upon the Tathāgata’s face, looked upon the ocean of
the circle of the assembly, looked upon the inconceivable field of activity of
the Buddha and the manifestations of the Tathāgata’s samādhi, which have
no center or limit, looked at his entry into inconceivable numbers of world
realms, looked at the nature of the illusory manifestations of inconceivable
wisdom, looked upon the inconceivable equality of the buddhas of the three
times, looked upon all his speech, definitions, and ways of the Dharma,
which have no center or limit, and recited these verses:
2. 14
“On each body hair there is an ocean of the realms of jinas184
As numerous as the atoms in all realms.
There,
 buddhas are seated on their buddha thrones,
185
Surrounded by assemblies of bodhisattvas. {1}
2. 15
“There appears an ocean of many realms on each body hair,
In each of which appears a guide at the foot of the supreme tree,
Seated upon a lotus seat on the bodhimaṇḍa,
Filling the vastness of the realm of phenomena. {2} [F.302.b]
2. 16
“On each single body hair reside jinas


---

As numerous as the atoms in all the realms.
They are encircled by assemblies of bodhisattvas
And all teaching good conduct. {3}
2. 17
“A jina resides in each supreme realm
With as many unending clouds of bodhisattvas,
Who filled all infinite realms, having come
From all of the ten directions without exception. {4}
2. 18
“Bodhisattvas, shining with an ocean of qualities,
As numerous as the atoms in ten million realms,
Who filled the realm of phenomena’s ten directions,
Have all appeared as the assembly of the teachers. {5}
2. 19
“Throughout all realms appear the images
Of an ocean of the kings of Dharma, the wisdom of the jinas.
All who are maintaining good conduct
Have come to be the assemblies of all the buddhas. {6}
2. 20
“Those who maintain the delightful conduct of bodhisattvas,186
Who dwell throughout all infinite realms,
Those heroes who listen to clouds of the Dharma,
Practice that conduct for ten million kalpas in each realm. {7}
2. 21
“The bodhisattvas who are practicing their conduct
Are radiant with the practice of an ocean
 of Dharma.
187
They engage in the entire ocean of prayers
And remain within the field of conduct of buddhahood. {8}
2. 22
“They who have originated from this and that Dharma of the jinas
Have the knowledge of completely good conduct.
They enter into the extensive miraculous appearance
Of oceans of the excellent qualities of the buddhas.
 {9}
188
2. 23
“The sugatas
 pervade the entirety of the realm of phenomena,
189
Continuously emanating clouds of bodies
As numerous as the atoms in all realms,
Bringing a rain of Dharma that leads to enlightenment.” {10} [B26]
2. 24
Then the Bhagavat, in order to further
 establish those bodhisattvas in this
samādhi of the gaping lion, [F.303.a] emanated from the ūrṇā hair between his
eyebrows a great ray of light called illumination of the three times focused on all
the entrances into the realm of the Dharma, and he was accompanied by an
190


---

entourage of light rays as numerous as the atoms in countless buddha
realms. They illuminated all the infinite buddha realms in all the oceans of
world realms in the ten directions.
2. 25
Then those bodhisattvas who were assembled in Jetavana saw all the
buddha realms that were included within the realm of phenomena, which
extended to the limits of space, and the buddha realms that were in the
atoms of all buddha realms that were as numerous
 as the atoms in all
buddha realms. In these buddha realms, which had different names and
colors,
 different levels of purification, different kinds of grounds,
 and
different kinds of appearances, there were those who had come to a
bodhimaṇḍa, were seated upon a bodhisattva’s lion throne, were being
offered to by the lords of the world, and were encircled by a supreme
assembly of bodhisattvas and were attaining the highest, complete
enlightenment of buddhahood.
191
192
193
2. 26
They saw in countless buddha realms some who were turning the wheel
of the Dharma with an extent of speech that filled the vastness of the realm
of phenomena. They saw some who were in the abodes of the devas; some
who were in the abodes of the nāgas; some who were in the abodes of the
yakṣas; some who were in the abodes of the asuras; some who were in the
abodes of the garuḍas; some who were in the abodes of the kinnaras; some
who were in the abodes of the mahoragas; some who were in the abodes of
lords of humans; some who were in the villages, towns, market towns,
districts, countries, and capitals in the world of humans; [F.303.b] with
various miraculous powers, various conducts, various bodies; demonstrating
various entrances to samādhi; with the various clairvoyances of samādhi;
appearing in various families and castes; manifesting various colors; having
various kinds of asuras; emanating various networks of light rays; having
various extents of voice, various humans that are being spoken to, and
various audiences for their teaching; and teaching the Dharma to the
gathered assemblies with various words, expressions,
 and definitions.
194
2. 27
As many bodhisattvas as there were
 saw in each of those gathered
assemblies
 a tathāgata’s profound miracles from a buddha’s samādhi.
195
196
2. 28
They saw the arising of the images of the miracles of the samādhis of
tathāgatas in as many world realms as there are throughout the realm of
phenomena and as far as the limits of space, that are present in the ten
directions, that are all around in the infinite directions, that are in the entire
ocean of directions, that are in the directions
 of various gateways into the
Dharma, that are conceived to be in the various directions, that are
assembled in the various directions, that are divided among the various
directions, that belong to the various directions, that are included within the
ocean of the various directions, which means in the eastern direction, in the
197


---

southern direction, in the western direction, in the northern direction, in the
northeastern direction, in the southeastern direction, in the southwestern
direction, in the northwestern direction, in the upward direction and the
downward direction, in the directions of groups of realms, in the directions
of groups
 of beings, in the directions of the conceived categories
 of
beings, in the directions of the furthest past, in the ten directions of the
present, in the directions that are focused on a very fine hair tip located
within the entire expanse of space, in the directions of the succession of
atoms in all realms,
 in the directions that are included within directions, in
the directions where the creation of various kinds of karma is accomplished,
[F.304.a] in the directions where space, which has no middle or edge, is
perceived as being in a single hair tip,
 in the minds of beings where the
three times are united in the state of equality and all beings are within a state
of equality, where there is no differentiation between the perceptions of all
beings, and where there is the equality of all sounds. They saw within the
groups
 of beings the approach of the forms of the tathāgatas before the
assemblies that directly perceive them. They saw the sameness of wisdom
within all kalpas. They saw in all the realms how equally everywhere there
was the perception of the appearance before them of the forms of the
tathāgatas in accordance with the aspirations of all beings. They saw their
teaching of all the Dharmas of the buddhas so that there was a continuous
guiding of all beings. They saw the miraculous activities of the tathāgatas.

2. 29
The Bhagavat Vairocana, through the four methods of gathering pupils
and through their corresponding previous practice of good actions, had
adopted all of them as pupils. They were ripened through teaching,
hearing,
 remembering, and reverence.
203
2. 30
They had in the past developed the aspiration to attain the highest
supreme enlightenment. When they had come before this and that tathāgata,
they had been adopted as their pupils because of their roots of merit.
2. 31
In that way, through having the corresponding roots of merit and because
they were adopted as pupils through the methods of ripening them for
omniscience, they saw and perceived the miracles of the samādhi of the
Bhagavat Vairocana, which are vast, extending to the limits of space. Some
perceived the Dharma body. [F.304.b] Some perceived the form body. Some
perceived his past bodhisattva accomplishment. Some perceived his
completion of the perfections. Some perceived the display of his pure field of
conduct. Some perceived the miracles of the bodhisattva level. Some
perceived the miracles of enlightenment. Some perceived miracles that were
not different from the samādhi practiced by a buddha. Some perceived the
strengths and fearlessnesses of the tathāgatas. Some perceived the ocean of
the realization of a buddha, and so on, perceiving an ocean of a buddha’s


---

miracles as numerous as the incalculable number of atoms in ten buddha
realms.
 They perceived an ocean of buddha miracles through various
aspirations, various paths, various gateways, various entries, various
ingresses, various ways, various observances, various directions, various
vessels, various regions, various worlds, various attainments, various
accumulations, various miracles, and various methods.
204
2. 32
The bodhisattvas perceived the ocean of miracles of the Bhagavat

thrones, and the entirety of Jetavana, and it spread throughout the entire
realm of phenomena. It was like this: in each instant of the mind there issued
forth vast clouds of networks of light rays that brought satisfaction to all
beings and pervaded the ten directions; there issued forth clouds of bells

The bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, seeing in the ten directions all those
manifestations of miracles through the miraculous power of the Buddha,
recited these verses:
2. 40
“Observe the appearance of the vast, infinite,
Miraculous power of the Buddha in Jetavana.
There have issued forth from all sensory objects

Clouds of bodies that have pervaded all directions. {11}
2. 41
“The vast, completely pure, infinite forms
Of the various displays of the Sugata’s offspring
Are perceived as images appearing
From the thrones and from sensory objects. {12}
2. 42
“A variety of displays, clouds of jewel light rays,
From the tips of the body hairs of the sons of the sugatas
Are emanated, spreading within all the realms
And resounding with the words of the buddhas. {13}
2. 43
“Bodies that resemble the forms of Brahmakāyika devas
With pure bodies and peaceful conduct
Issue forth from the blossoms on the trees,254
Describing the aspects of dhyāna as they go. {14}
2. 44
“From the Sugata’s pores issue forth,
Without impediment, innumerable, countless emanations
Who are bodhisattvas that resemble Samanta bhadra,
Their bodies adorned by the characteristics and features. {15} [F.311.b]
2. 45
“The great ocean of the emanated qualities
Of the sugatas’ sons who have appeared in the three times,
Who are clouds of displays of an ocean of qualities,
Proclaim those who are seated in Jetavana.
 {16}
255
2. 46
“A vast ocean of the variety, without exception,
Of the karma of beings in all directions
Is proclaimed, issuing forth from within
The forms of the trees in Jetavana. {17}
2. 47
“The miracles in all the realms, without exception,
Of all the jinas who appear in the three times,
Appear as each and every sensory object
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms.
 {18}
256
2. 48
“Clouds of oceans of buddhas in the realms in the directions
Disseminate from each of their pore hairs,
In each instant, a variety of the abodes of buddhas,
Within which reside multitudes of clouds of buddhas. {19}
2. 49
“They pervade every direction, wherever there are beings,
And through skillful methods ripen those beings.
From their light there issue forth vast clouds

Of oceans of perfumes, light rays,
 and flowers. {20}
257
2. 50
“The precious divine palaces as immeasurable as space
Are beautified with every adornment without exception.
Those realms and their bodhimaṇḍas
Pervade every direction. {21}
2. 51
“The sugatas’ sons who appear in the three times
Purify the ocean of realms
Through the practice of completely good conduct,258
And their various displays, as limitless as beings, {22}
2. 52
“Fill all directions and the three times.
They have been purified in a great ocean of kalpas,
And they all appear like reflections
In the expanse of the sky above Jetavana.” {23}
2. 53
Those bodhisattvas were continuously illumined by the samādhi of the
Buddha. Each of those bodhisattvas had entered gateways of great
compassion as numerous as the atoms in innumerable buddha realms and
[F.312.a] brought even more benefit for beings. Resting in meditation in that
way there issued from each of their body hairs light rays as numerous as the
atoms in innumerable buddha realms, and from the tips of each of those light
rays there issued clouds of bodhisattvas’ emanations, emanated bodies that
resembled the bodies of the Indras of all worlds, bodies that looked upon all
beings and ripened all beings. Having issued forth, they pervaded the realm
of phenomena in all directions. They inspired all beings, ripened them, and
guided them.
2. 54
They inspired beings with the gateways that taught being reborn in
paradises after death; with the gateways that taught rebirth in all world
realms; with the gateways that taught the domain of bodhisattva conduct;
with the gateways that taught dreams, which were as numerous as the
atoms in innumerable buddha realms; with the gateways that arose from
aspirations of all bodhisattvas; with the gateways that shook the world

gateways that taught the perfection of diligence through the great miracles
of the bodhisattvas; with the gateways that described the dhyānas,
liberations, and samādhis of the bodhisattvas and the radiance of the domain
that is the path of the wisdom of the buddhas; with the gateways that taught
the sacrificing of countless bodies for the sake of seeking all the Dharmas of


---

the buddhas [F.312.b] and for the sake of each word and letter of the Dharma;
with the gateways of going into the presence of all the tathāgatas and
asking questions concerning all the Dharmas; with the gateways of being
focused on the radiance of an ocean of the ways of attaining going into the
presence of beings when the time is right and, in accordance with their
aspirations, ripening them for omniscience; with the gateways that teach the
victory banner of the power of the invincibility of the merit and wisdom of
bodhisattvas in the face of māras and adversaries; with the gateways that
teach the level
 of the wisdom that has knowledge and understanding of
all crafts; with the gateways that teach the level
 of knowledge and
understanding that is superior to that of all beings; with the gateways that
teach the level
 of the wisdom that has the knowledge and understanding
of the different aspirations of all beings; with the gateways that teach the
level
 of the wisdom that has the knowledge and understanding of the
capabilities, entrances, engagements, and various kleśas and predispositions
of all beings;
 and with the gateways that teach the level of the wisdom
that has the knowledge and understanding of the variety of karma and
practices of all beings.
 With other such gateways as numerous as the
atoms in innumerable buddha realms that contained methods for ripening
and guiding beings, those bodhisattvas went to the abodes of all beings and
appeared there. Some went to the abodes of devas and appeared there. Some
went to the abodes of nāgas and appeared there. Some went to the abodes of
yakṣas and appeared there. Some went to the abodes of gandharvas and

In order to ripen and guide with undivided great compassion, with
undivided aspiration, with undivided wisdom, with an undivided attraction
of beings, and in accordance with the aspirations of beings, those beings
who are guided by seeing them, guided by hearing them, guided by
remembering them, guided by the scope of their voices, guided by the sound
of the river of their names, guided by their halos, or guided by their
emanating a net of light rays —those bodhisattvas in Jetavana filled with an
array of various emanations the entire extent of world realms and the entire
extent of the realms of beings without moving from the feet of the Tathāgata.

2. 56
Some made their own dwellings, kūṭāgāras, thrones, and retinues appear
throughout the ten directions without moving from the feet of the Tathāgata.
Some sent forth clouds of emanations, while some appeared to go alone,
with no companion, in order to ripen beings, without moving from the circle
of the Tathāgata’s entourage. Some appeared in the form of śramaṇas, some
in the form of Brahmās, some in the form of those adorned all over with all
emblems,
 some in the form of physicians, some in the form of merchants,
some in the form of disciples, [F.313.b] some in the form of dancers, some in
the form of devotees to deities, and some in the form of those skilled in all
crafts, all of them appearing in villages, towns, market towns, regions, and
capitals. They appeared at the times that were the appropriate times,
assuming different appropriate bodies, with different colors and body
shapes, different voices, different languages, different kinds of conduct, and
different kinds of residence. They practiced the bodhisattva conduct in
which all beings are known to be illusions, which illuminated the entire
realm of crafts, which was a bright lamp that revealed the knowledge of all
beings, which was adorned with the blessing of all truths,
 which had the
light that illuminated all Dharmas,
 and which purified beings in the yānas
in all directions, and they practiced the bodhisattva conduct that illuminated
the entire domain of the Dharma. In order to ripen and guide beings, they
appeared in villages, towns, market towns, regions, and capitals.

Dharma;

down to him; deva lords who had been saddened by saṃsāra and gazed
with admiration; and lords of Brahmakāyika devas who bowed down with
great respect.
3. 2
Mañjuśrī, together with them, displaying the prowess of a bodhisattva,
respectfully made praises and offerings. Then he came out of his abode and
circumambulated the Bhagavat many hundreds of times, keeping him to his
right, and made many offerings. He then left the presence of the Bhagavat
and departed to the land of the southern region. [B27]
3. 3
Through the blessing of the Buddha, Brother Śāriputra saw Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta, who, with that display of bodhisattva miracles, departed from
Jetavana and went to the southern region. He thought, “I will go with
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta to that land.”
3. 4
Leading his following of sixty bhikṣus, he left where he was sitting,
approached the Bhagavat, bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s feet, and asked
for the Bhagavat’s permission. When the Bhagavat had given it, Śāriputra
circumambulated him three times, left the presence of the Bhagavat, and
went to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta had gone, together with his following
of sixty bhikṣus who had all newly and not long before entered
homelessness. They were the bhikṣus Sāgara buddhi, Mahāsudata, Puṇya-
prabha, 
Mahāvatsa, 
Vibhudatta, 
Viśuddhacārin, 
Devaśrī, 
Indramati,
Brahmottama, Praśānta mati, and others. [F.315.a]
3. 5
They had all served jinas in the past, planted
 the roots of merit, had
profound aspiration, had the purified eyes of faith, practiced with a vast
mentality, had the power to see the buddhas in the directions, had realized
the nature and character of the Dharma, had the intention to benefit others,
aspired to the qualities of the Tathāgata, and had been guided by the
Dharma teaching of Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta.
275
Leading those followers, Śāriputra went to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta
had gone.
3. 6
When Brother Śāriputra was on the way, he looked at all those bhikṣus
and said to the bhikṣu Sāgara buddhi, “Sāgara buddhi, regard the bodhisattva
Mañjuśrī upon a path that has a checkerboard pattern
 and displays of his
path as he walks along it.
276
3. 7
“His pure body is inconceivable to devas and humans. It is beautified by
the signs and features of a great being. It has a pure halo of light. It emits a
display of a network of light rays that brings joy to countless beings. It
brings to an end the sufferings of countless beings. It is accompanied by a
perfect entourage, and it is in possession of past roots of merit.
3. 8
“The displays of the prowess of his path are directed toward the domain
of every direction; the displays of his perfection of merit issue forth to the
right and left as great treasures.


---

3. 9
“These displays emerge from within all the trees as the result of his roots
of merit from serving past buddhas. All the lords of the world bow down to
him and send down a rain of clouds of offerings. All the tathāgatas in the ten
directions emanate
 multitudes of disks composed of nets of light rays that
[F.315.b] resound with all the Dharma of the buddhas and descend
 onto
the crown of his head.”
277
278
3. 10
Beginning with the above, Brother Śāriputra described, explained,
announced, narrated, related, elucidated, and brought illumination to the
bhikṣus concerning Mañjuśrī’s measureless displays of the qualities of
following the path.
3. 11
The more that Sthavira Śāriputra described Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta’s
qualities, the more the minds of the bhikṣus became purified and became
clearer, the strength of their joy increased, delight arose, the continuum of
their minds became adept, their faculties became clearer, their happiness
increased, they cast off unhappiness, they became free of the mind’s faults,
they repelled all obscurations, they became intent on seeing the Buddha,
their minds turned to the Buddha’s Dharma, their bodhisattva faculties were
purified, the power of their bodhisattva faith developed, great compassion
arose, they gained the prowess of the domain of the perfections, they fully
developed great compassion, and they perceived the ocean of buddhas in
the ten directions.
3. 12
Having attained the power of aspiration to omniscience, they spoke these
words: “Upādhyāya, we pray that we too may be able to go into the presence
of that supreme being.”
3. 13
Then Brother Śāriputra, together with the bhikṣus, went to where
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was and said these words: “Mañjuśrī, these bhikṣus
wish to see you.”
3. 14
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, [F.316.a] together with the entire circle of his
followers, turned
 and looked upon the bhikṣus with the majestic gaze of
an elephant.
279
3. 15
The bhikṣus bowed their heads to the feet of Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, and
then with their palms together in reverence they said, “Holy being, through
the roots of merit from seeing you and paying homage to you, and also our
other roots of merit that you know we have, that our upādhyāya knows we
have, and that the Bhagavat Tathāgata Śākyamuni sees we have, may we
become like you. May we obtain bodies that are the same as yours, voices the
same as yours, and features the same as yours, and may we attain
miraculous powers the same as yours.”
3. 16
When the bhikṣus had said this, Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta said to the
bhikṣus, “Bhikṣus, the noble man or noble woman with the ten unflagging
motivations who enters the Mahāyāna will ascend to the level of a tathāgata,


---

and therefore, it goes without saying,
 to the level of a bodhisattva. What
are those ten? They are (1) the unflagging motivation to see, pay homage to,
offer to, and serve all the tathāgatas; (2) the unflagging motivation to never
abandon accumulating all roots of merit; (3) the unflagging motivation to
seek all Dharmas; (4) the unflagging motivation to practice all the
bodhisattva perfections; (5) the unflagging motivation to accomplish all the
bodhisattva samādhis; (6) the unflagging motivation to enter all successive
times; [F.316.b] (7) the unflagging motivation to purify the extensive oceans
of buddha realms in the ten directions; (8) the unflagging motivation to ripen
and guide all realms of beings; (9) the unflagging motivation to accomplish
the conduct of a bodhisattva in all realms and kalpas; and (10) the
unflagging motivation to accomplish one power of the tathāgatas by
ripening all beings in the way that one would ripen one being through the
practice of perfections as numerous as the atoms in all buddha realms.
280
3. 17
“Bhikṣus, the noble man or noble woman with faith who has these ten
unflagging motivations will accomplish all roots of merit, will turn away
from all existences in saṃsāra, will transcend all the worldly existences, will
transcend all the levels of śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, will become a
member of the family of all the tathāgatas, will accomplish the aspirations of
all bodhisattvas, will purify the practice of the qualities of all the tathāgatas,
will purify all bodhisattva conduct, will have the strength of all tathāgatas,
will subdue all māras and adversaries, will ascend to the level of
bodhisattvas, and will approach the level of the tathāgatas.” [F.317.a]
3. 18
When the bhikṣus heard this way of the Dharma, they attained the
samādhi the unimpeded vision that sees all the buddhas. Through its power they
saw all the tathāgatas and the circles of their assemblies that were present in
infinite, endless world realms in the ten directions. They also saw every
being that had been reborn into an existence in those world realms. They
saw every being in those world realms.
 They saw the various divisions of
those world realms. They knew the number of atoms in those worlds. They
saw the residences and adornments made of jewels
 that those beings
enjoyed. They heard the ocean of the aspects of speech of those tathāgatas.
They knew those Dharma teachings through their words, letters, definitions,
languages,
 names, and symbols.
 They viewed the minds, faculties, and
aspirations of those beings. They knew ten lifetimes back into the past and
ten lifetimes into the future. They comprehended the explanations of ten
turnings of Dharma wheels by those tathāgatas. They comprehended ten
attainments of manifestations of miraculous powers. They comprehended
the accomplishment of ten ways given in the teachings. They comprehended
ten explanations of the words of the teachings. They comprehended ten
accomplishments of the analytic knowledge of those tathāgatas.
281
282
283

3. 19
As soon as they attained that samādhi, [F.317.b] they perfected ten
thousand aspects of the aspiration to enlightenment, they attained ten
thousand samādhis, they purified ten thousand aspects of the perfections,
they attained a great radiance, they illuminated the domain of great wisdom,
and they attained ten bodhisattva clairvoyances.
3. 20
They who had thus attained the small young seedlings of clairvoyance
and had gained the resolute aspiration to enlightenment were then inspired
to and established in completely good bodhisattva conduct
 by Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta.
285
3. 21
They who were thus established in completely good bodhisattva conduct
entered an ocean of great aspirations and fulfilled them. Through fulfilling
an ocean of great aspirations with a pure motivation they attained purity of
the body. Through purity of the body they attained lightness of body.
Through that purity of body and lightness of body they vastly increased
their entrances to clairvoyances. They attained everlasting clairvoyances.
Through that attainment of clairvoyance, while constantly remaining at the
feet of Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta and in order to accomplish all the Dharmas of
the buddhas, they created clouds of the activities
 of the bodies of all the
tathāgatas in the ten directions.
286
3. 22
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, having established those bhikṣus in the
aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment, traveled to the southern
region and came to the great city called Dhanyākara. Having reached there,
he and his entourage went the east of Dhanyākara, [F.318.a] where there was
a great forest called Vicitra sāla dhvaja vyūha.
 It was a sacred place where
buddhas of the past had dwelled. It had been consecrated by the tathāgatas
for the ripening of beings. Its name was renowned throughout endless
realms. It was a place where the Bhagavat, when he was practicing
bodhisattva conduct in the past, performed many difficult actions of
generosity. It was a place where devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras,
garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans constantly
engaged in making offerings.
287
3. 23
There Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta taught the sūtra called The Radiance of the
Way of the Essence of Phenomena, from which arose a septillion
 sūtras. During
that teaching, many hundred thousand quintillions of nāgas came from the
great ocean. When they had heard that way of the Dharma, they became
disgusted with their existences as nāgas and aspired to have the qualities of
a tathāgata. They abandoned their nāga existences and gained rebirth as
devas or humans. Ten thousand nāgas attained irreversibility from the
highest, complete enlightenment. During the time he taught that Dharma,
endlessly numerous realms of beings were guided through the three yānas.
288


---

3. 24
The people in Dhanyākara heard that Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta had come to
Dhanyākara and was dwelling in the sacred Vicitra sāla dhvaja vyūha.
3. 25
The leading
 upāsaka Mahāprajña and upāsakas, upāsikās, sons, and
daughters, [F.318.b] each accompanied by an entourage that numbered five
hundred, came out from Dhanyākara city and went to where Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta was.
289
3. 26
The upāsaka Mahāprajña, with other upāsakas such as Sudatta, Vasudatta,
Puṇya prabha, 
Yaśodeva, 
Somaśriti, 
Somanandi, 
Sumati, 
Mahāmati,
Rāhulabhadra, Bhadra śrī, and so on, each with an entourage of five hundred
upāsakas, came to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was, bowed their heads to
his feet, circumambulated Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta three times, and sat to one
side.
3. 27
The upāsikā named Mahāprajñā, with other upāsikās such as Suprabhā,
Sugātrā, Subhadrā, Bhadra śrī, Candra prabhāsā, Ketuprabhā, Śrībhadrā, and
Sulocanā and so on, each with an entourage of five hundred upāsikās, came
to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was, bowed their heads to his feet,
circumambulated Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta three times, and sat to one side.
3. 28
The head merchant’s son
 Sudhana, with other sons of head merchants
such as Suvrata, Suśīla, Svācāra, Suvikrāmin, Sucinti, Sumati, Subuddhi,
Sunetra, Subāhu, Suprabha, and so on, each with an entourage of five
hundred sons of head merchants, came to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta
was, [F.319.a] bowed their heads to his feet, circumambulated Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta three times, and sat to one side.
290
3. 29
Subhadrā, the daughter of the layman Mahāprajña, with other daughters
such as Bhadrā, Abhirāmavartā, Dṛḍhamatī, Śrībhadrā, Brahmadattā,
Śrīprabhā, Suprabhā, and so on, each with an entourage of five hundred
daughters, came to where Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was, bowed their heads to
his feet, circumambulated Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta three times, and sat to one
side.
3. 30
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, knowing that the men, women, boys, and
girls from Dhanyākara had gathered and assembled, overwhelmed them
with the magnificence of his teaching in accordance with their wishes,
comforted them with the magnificence of his great love, accomplished the
teaching of the Dharma through the magnificence of his great compassion,
and investigated their minds and aspirations through the magnificence of
his wisdom. Delighting in teaching the Dharma with his great discernment,
he observed Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
3. 31
He said, “Why is Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, called Sudhana? The
instant that Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, entered his mother’s womb,
all around his home seven precious sprouts
 emerged. Beneath those
precious sprouts there were seven treasures of precious substances. Those
291


---

precious sprouts made of those seven precious substances rose up through
the ground from those treasures, which were gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red
pearls, emeralds, and white coral.
3. 32
“After ten months, when his limbs and body parts were completely
formed, [F.319.b] he was born. At that time, those seven great treasures
became visible, rising up above the ground to the height and breadth of
seven cubits, bright and beautiful. Inside the house appeared five hundred
pots made of various kinds of precious substances. There were pots filled
with ghee, pots filled with sesame oil, pots filled with honey, and pots filled
with butter. There were individual pots filled with whatever was necessary.
There were diamond pots filled with every kind of perfume, pots of aromatic
wood filled with various kinds of cloth, crystal pots filled with various kinds
of enjoyable food delicious with perfect flavors, jewel pots filled with various
kinds of precious substances, gold pots filled with silver powder, silver pots
filled with gold dust, pots of silver and gold filled with beryl jewels, quartz
pots filled with white coral, white-coral pots filled with quartz jewels,
emerald pots filled with red pearls, red-pearl pots filled with emeralds, cat’s-
eye-jewel pots filled with moonstone jewels, moonstone-jewel pots filled
with cat’s-eye jewels, and so on. Five hundred such precious pots appeared.
3. 33
“As soon as that Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was born, there fell a
rain of wealth, grain, money, gold, and all kinds of jewels in all the
storerooms and granaries in the house.
3. 34
“The brahmin prognosticators, his parents, and his relatives said, ‘As soon
as he was born there appeared this perfection of much wealth,’ and they
gave him the name Sudhana, meaning Excellent Wealth. [F.320.a]
3. 35
“This Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, has served past jinas, has
planted roots of merit, possesses a vast aspiration, and is motivated to follow
kalyāṇamitras. His physical, vocal, and mental actions are irreproachable. He
is dedicated to purifying the bodhisattva path. He is focused on omniscience.
He is a worthy vessel for the Dharma of the buddhas. He has a pure
manner
 of aspiration. He has perfected an unimpeded aspiration for
enlightenment.”
292
3. 36
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta looked upon Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, welcomed him, and taught him the Dharma. He taught the Dharma
through teaching on the Dharma of all the buddhas, on uniting and attaining
the Dharma of all the buddhas, on the infinity of all the buddhas,
 on the
successive appearance of all the buddhas, on the pure circles of the followers
of all the buddhas, on the display
 of the Dharma wheels and
emanations
 of all the buddhas, on the pure characteristics and features of
the bodies of all the buddhas, on the accomplishment of the Dharma body of
293
294
295


---

all the buddhas, on the display of the speech of all the buddhas, on the pure
display of the auras of all the buddhas, and on the equality of all the
buddhas.
3. 37
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, [F.320.b] through speaking about the Dharma,
taught, motivated, encouraged, and inspired Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, and that great assembly of beings, and made them develop the
aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment and remember their past
roots of merit.
3. 38
He blessed and made happy
 the beings from the city of Dhanyākara by
teaching them the Dharma according to their wishes, and he departed.
296
3. 39
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having heard from Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta the nature of the greatness and
 qualities of the buddhas,
aspired to the highest, complete enlightenment. He diligently followed
behind Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, reciting these verses of praise to him:
297
3. 40
“Oh wise one! Through your power
I am set on enlightenment for the benefit
 of beings.
298
You who have an infinite range of activity,299
Hear from the certainty that I have. {1}
3. 41
“The great city of the three realms of existence
Is encircled by a moat of the water of delight,
Has the raised walls of pride and conceit,
And has the gateways into all
 the states of beings. {2}
300
3. 42
“It is covered by the darkness
 of ignorance and unknowing;
301
It is burned by the flames of desire and anger
And is continuously ruled by the lord of māras:
That is where ignorant fools make their home. {3}
3. 43
“Confined in the fetters and chains of craving,
Rendered powerless by the defects of deception and deceit,
Their eyes blinded by doubt and uncertainty,
They are on the path that leads in the wrong direction. {4}
3. 44
“Bound tightly by the ropes of envy and greed,
They go to the unfortunate states of pretas, animals, and hells.
Tormented by aging, death, illness, and rebirth,
Bewildered they go around on the wheel of existences. {5}
3. 45
“You shine the light rays of wisdom [F.321.a]
From the disk of your pure compassion,
Which come forth
 to dry up the ocean of kleśas.
302
You who are a sun, shine upon me! {6}


---

3. 46
“The full disk of your meditation of love,
The moonlight of your merit brings happiness,
Shining on the dwellings of all beings:
You who are like a full moon, shine upon me! {7}
3. 47
“You possess the treasure of good karma’s power
And fly freely through the sky of the essence of phenomena.303
You bear the precious wheel of the Dharma.
You who are a king, give me your command! {8}
3. 48
“You have the courageous resolution
 for the path to enlightenment.
304
You have accumulated vast merit and wisdom,
And you set forth for the benefit of all beings.
Caravan leader, give me your protection! {9}
3. 49
“You wear the armor of strong, unwavering patience;
With the sword
 of wisdom and the long arm of compassion,
305
You confront the army of māras in battle.
You who are a hero, bring me to safety! {10}
3. 50
“You dwell on the summit of the Dharma Meru,
Encircled
 by the apsarases of supreme samādhi,
306
Subjugating the asura Rāhu of the kleśas.
You who are Śakra, look upon me! {11}
3. 51
“In the residence of the three realms where the foolish live,
Your knowledge clears away kleśa and karma.
In the obscurity of the wheel of existences and the level of causes
You are a lamp; reveal to me the way to proceed! {12}
3. 52
“You turn from the path that leads to the lower existences.
You make pure the path that leads to the happy existences.
You have transcended all worldly paths.
Show me the
 gateway to liberation! {13}
307
3. 53
“You close and block
 the gateway to the false beliefs
308
That have the conceptions of permanence, self, and happiness.
You possess the sharp eyes with the power
 of the wisdom of truth.
309
Quickly open for me the gateway to liberation! {14} [F.321.b]
3. 54
“You know what are the right and the wrong paths.
Skilled
 in the practices and knowledge of the paths,
310
You have mastered the ways of all paths.
Teach to me the path to enlightenment! {15}

3. 55
“You reside upon the plain of the level of the true view,
Bring the water of the qualities of all the buddhas,
And rain down the flowers of the Buddhadharma’s qualities.
Teach to me the path to enlightenment! {16}
3. 56
“Revealer
 of the path, show me
311
The jinas of the past and the future
And the jinas who appear in the present,
The sugatas, the principal beings in all directions. {17}
3. 57
“You who are skilled
 in employing the apparatus of karma,
312
Proficient in the apparatus of the Dharma vehicle’s chariot,
And skilled
 in employing the apparatus of wisdom,
313
Teach to me the vehicle for enlightenment! {18}
3. 58
“Bring me up onto the vehicle of enlightenment
That has the circling wheels of aspiration and resolution,
Has the stable axle of patience and vajra compassion,
And is beautified by the precious shafts of faith. {19}
3. 59
“Carry
 me in the excellent, supreme vehicle

That has the wheels of all mental retentions,
Is adorned by a covering roof of love,
And is beautified by the strings of bells of discernment. {20}
3. 60
“Lead me onto the royal
 vehicle

Adorned with a bed
 of celibacy,

Crowded
 with a hundred billion women of samādhi,
317
And resounding with the sound of Dharma drums. {21}
3. 61
“Reveal to me the excellent vehicle
That has the unending treasure of the four methods of gathering pupils
And is adorned by strings of qualities, the jewels of wisdom,
Tied with the supreme thongs of self-control and a sense of shame. {22}
3. 62
“Quickly place me on the supreme vehicle
That has the excellent wheels of the light rays of generosity
And is anointed with compassion and the sandalwood of good conduct,
Its parts held together by the strong nails
 of patience. {23} [F.322.a]
318
3. 63
“Bring me onto the supreme Dharma vehicle
That never turns back from guiding beings,

3. 64
“Bring me up onto the vehicle of the Dharma

“Bring me up onto the vehicle of the Dharma,

328
3. 72
“Bring me up onto the supreme vehicle,

3. 73
“Reveal to me the sun of wisdom
That sustains beings like the sun,
An attracting disk with vast light rays,330
Radiant with supremely pure retention. {34}
3. 74
“You are wise in the nature of causes and all levels
Through having trained for a multitude of numerous kalpas.

“Within a vast ocean of wisdom
You acquired an ocean of unequaled understanding.

 of the Dharma king

332
Where you reside possessing perfect eyes,

Your head bound with the supreme turban of the Dharma.” {37}
3. 77
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta looked with the gaze of an elephant upon
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, and said to him, “Noble one, it is
excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, wish to follow a kalyāṇamitra and complete the
path of a bodhisattva, and wish to ask about bodhisattva conduct.
3. 78
“Noble one, it is like this: serving, following, and attending to a
kalyāṇamitra is the basis and the corresponding cause for the attainment of
omniscience.
“Therefore, noble one, you should not tire of serving and honoring a
kalyāṇamitra.” [F.323.a]
3. 79
Sudhana said, “Ārya, teach me in detail —how does a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? In what way does a bodhisattva practice it? How does
a bodhisattva commence with bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva
practice bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva perfect bodhisattva
conduct? How does a bodhisattva purify bodhisattva conduct? How does a
bodhisattva enter into bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva attain
bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva follow bodhisattva conduct?
How does a bodhisattva gain hold
 of bodhisattva conduct? How does a
bodhisattva increase bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva perfect
the domain of completely good conduct?”
333
3. 80
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta recited these verses to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son:


---

3. 81
“Your coming into my presence
Is like an ocean of good merit.
It is excellent that you seek supreme enlightenment
With a mind that has vast loving compassion. {38}
3. 82
“You have aspired to the unequaled conduct
In order to liberate all beings.
You will become a protector of all beings —
That is the way of bodhisattva conduct. {39}
3. 83
“Those bodhisattvas who are completely resolute,
Who have untiring minds in saṃsāra,
Attain the conduct that is completely good,
That is invincible and unimpeded. {40}
3. 84
“In order to benefit beings, you aspire
To the conduct that is completely good,
Which has the radiance
 of merit, the splendor
 of merit, [F.323.b]
334
335
An ocean of merit, and the emblems of virtue and purity.
 {41}
336
3. 85
“In the worlds in the ten directions, you will see the buddhas
Who are beyond measure, without center or end.
You will possess their clouds of Dharma
Through the power and might of your memory. {42}
3. 86
“In that way, you will see the jinas
In all the buddha realms in the ten directions.
And within
 bodhisattva conduct
337
You will fulfill
 an ocean of their aspirations. {43}
338
3. 87
“Those who enter into an ocean of this way
And are established on the level of buddhahood
Train under the lords of the world,
And thereby they all become omniscient. {44}
3. 88
“You will practice the completely good conduct
Throughout the vastness of realms
For as many kalpas as numerous as atoms
And attain the peace of enlightenment. {45}
3. 89
“You should practice for an ocean of kalpas
Throughout all the realms, which are without end,
And you should fulfill your aspiration
For the completely good conduct. {46}

3. 90
“Observe a hundred billion beings
Who are delighted on hearing your prayer:
They aspire to supreme enlightenment
Through completely good wisdom.” {47}
3. 91
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, having recited those verses, said to Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have
in that way developed the aspiration to enlightenment [F.324.a] and have the
intention to seek for bodhisattva conduct!
3. 92
“Noble one, in that way, the beings who develop the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment are very rare. Even more rare are the
beings who, having developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, then seek for bodhisattva conduct.
3. 93
“Therefore, noble one, bodhisattvas should gain certain knowledge from
true kalyāṇamitras. They should be tireless in their search for kalyāṇamitras.
They should never have enough of looking at the kalyāṇamitras. They
should successfully master the teachings of the kalyāṇamitras. They should
not become angered by the kalyāṇamitras’ conduct of skillful methods.
3. 94
“Noble one, in this southern region there is a land named Rāmāvarānta, in
which there is a mountain called Sugrīva, where there lives a bhikṣu by the
name of Meghaśrī. Go to him and ask him, ‘How do bodhisattvas train in
bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas practice it? How do bodhisattvas
commence with bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas practice
bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas perfect bodhisattva conduct?
How do they purify it? How do they enter it? How do they attain it? How do
they follow it? How do they maintain
 it? How do they increase it? How do
bodhisattvas perfect the domain of completely good conduct?’
339
“Then that kalyāṇamitra will teach you the domain of completely good
conduct.”
3. 95
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, filled with joy, delighted, elated,
pleased, and happy, [F.324.b] bowed his head to the feet of Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta. He circumambulated Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta many hundreds
of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back at him
many hundreds of thousands of times, with his mind enraptured by that
kalyāṇamitra, unable to endure not seeing that kalyāṇamitra, with his face
covered in tears and weeping, he departed from Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta.

MEGHAŚRĪ
4. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, eventually arrived at the land
called Rāmāvarānta. Having arrived there, he traveled through the land of
Rāmāvarānta. Enjoying the delightful pleasures that arose from his past
roots of merit and through the power of vast karma, he came to Sugrīva
Mountain. He climbed Sugrīva Mountain and, seeking the bhikṣu Meghaśrī,
he went to its eastern side. In the same way, he went to its southern,
western, 
northern, 
northeastern, 
southeastern, 
southwestern, 
and
northwestern sides, looking up and down for the bhikṣu Meghaśrī.
4. 2
After seven days had passed, he saw the bhikṣu Meghaśrī walking on a
plateau
 on the summit of another mountain.
340
4. 3
He went to where the bhikṣu Meghaśrī was and bowed his head to the
bhikṣu Meghaśrī’s feet. He circumambulated the bhikṣu Meghaśrī, keeping
him to his right. He sat before him and with palms pressed together said,
“Ārya, I wish to know this: When bodhisattvas have developed the
aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment, how do bodhisattvas
train in bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas practice it? How do
bodhisattvas commence in bodhisattva conduct? [F.325.a] How do
bodhisattvas practice bodhisattva conduct? How do bodhisattvas perfect
bodhisattva conduct? How do they purify it? How do they enter it? How do
they attain it? How do they follow it? How do they maintain
 it? How do
they increase it? How do bodhisattvas perfect the domain of completely
good conduct?
341
4. 4
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas set out for the
highest, complete enlightenment!”
4. 5
The bhikṣu Meghaśrī said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble
one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment and are asking about the bodhisattva

conduct.
4. 6
“Noble one, it is like this: these are difficult, extremely difficult —seeking
the bodhisattva conduct, seeking the bodhisattva’s scope of activity, seeking
the bodhisattva’s pure setting-forth, seeking the bodhisattva’s pure path,
seeking the bodhisattva’s pure, vast conduct, seeking the bodhisattva’s pure
attainment of the higher cognitions, manifesting the bodhisattva’s
liberations, manifesting the bodhisattva’s continuum
 of compassion for
the world,
 the bodhisattva’s compliance with the aspirations of beings,
[F.325.b] the bodhisattva’s revelation of the gateways to saṃsāra and
nirvāṇa, and seeking the bodhisattva’s activities that are unstained by
composite defects, noncomposite defects, and fear.
342
343
4. 7
“Noble one, through the power and might of my aspiration, through
having the pure eyes of wisdom and the pure eyes of faith, and by looking
straight ahead with the illumination of the light of wisdom, perceiving
everything before me, the entire unobstructed field of vision, with a sight
that is free of all obscuration, with astute observation, with a completely pure
field of vision, and with a pure body, and bowing down toward the extent of
every direction with a skillful bowing-down of the body, with the power of
retaining the clouds of Dharma of all the buddhas, and with the might of the
power of retention, I see the tathāgatas in the realms in every direction
before me.
4. 8
“In that way, I see one tathāgata in the eastern direction; I see two
buddhas, ten buddhas, a hundred buddhas, a thousand buddhas, a hundred
thousand buddhas, ten million buddhas, a billion buddhas, ten thousand
million buddhas, a trillion buddhas, a quintillion buddhas, and so on up to
limitless, immeasurable, countless, inconceivable, unequaled, infinite,
endless, incalculable, and more indescribable than indescribable numbers of
buddhas.
4. 9
“I see tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in Jambudvīpa, tathāgatas as
numerous as the atoms in the world realm of four continents, in the world
realm of a thousand four-continent worlds, in the world realm of a million
four-continent worlds, and in the world realm of a billion four-continent
worlds. [F.326.a]

“I see buddhas as numerous as the atoms in ten buddha realms. I see
buddhas as numerous as the atoms in a hundred buddha realms. I see
buddhas as numerous as the atoms in a thousand buddha realms. I see
buddhas as numerous as the atoms in a hundred thousand buddha realms. I

4. 11
“Just as I see in the east, in the south, in the west, in the north, in the
northeast, in the southeast, in the southwest, in the northwest, below, and
above, I see one tathāgata and so on up to tathāgatas as numerous as the
atoms in more indescribable than indescribable numbers of buddha realms.
4. 12
“In each direction I see tathāgatas of various colors, of various shapes,
with various miraculous powers, with various majestic miracles, with various
assemblies of followers, shining with networks of many light rays in many
colors, in infinite colors, in an array of different pure buddha realms and
palaces, with different kinds of pure lifespans, addressing
 beings in
accordance with their aspirations, [F.326.b] manifesting different kinds of
miracles through the pure attainment of buddhahood, and resounding with
the majestic lion’s roar of the buddhas.
344
4. 13
“In that way, noble one, I have attained mindfulness of the buddhas
through beholding the aggregation of the knowledge of all objects of
perception from all sides.
4. 14
“But how could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the pure
domain of the infinite
 wisdom of the bodhisattvas who have attained the
gateway of mindfulness of the buddhas called the completely radiant domain

buddhas called peace through perceiving in each instant the passing into
nirvāṇa of all tathāgatas in all world realms.

4. 35
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a district called Sāgara-
mukha. There dwells a bhikṣu by the name of Sāgara megha. Go to him and
ask him, ‘How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a
bodhisattva practice it?’
4. 36
“Noble one, that kalyāṇamitra will explain it to you.
 He will reveal to
you the cause of the accumulation of merit. He will make you understand the
level
 of vast accumulation. He will describe the vast power and might of
roots of merit. [F.328.a] He will make known to you the vast cause for the
accumulation of the aspiration to enlightenment. He will provide the basis
for the cause of the great radiance of the Mahāyāna. He will enable in you
the vast power of the accumulation of the perfections. He will enable you to
purify your entry into the vast ocean of conduct. He will enable you to purify
a vast domain of aspirations. He will enable you to develop vast displays
that emerge from everywhere. He will augment the vast power of great
compassion.”

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Meghaśrī, circumambulated the bhikṣu Meghaśrī a hundred

thousand times, departed from the bhikṣu Meghaśrī. [B28]

SĀGARA MEGHA
5. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplated the instruction of
that kalyāṇamitra. He remembered the radiance of his wisdom.
 He
analyzed that bodhisattva’s liberation. He reflected on
 the bodhisattva’s
way of samādhi. He looked at the way of an ocean of bodhisattvas. He
aspired toward the domain of buddhahood. He delighted in the direction of
the vision of the buddhas. He contemplated the ocean of buddhas. He
remembered the succession of buddhas. He comprehended that which is
understood in the way of the buddhas.
 He looked into the sky of the
buddhas.
352
353
354
5. 2
Eventually he arrived in the area called Sāgara mukha [F.328.b] and went to
where the bhikṣu Sāgara megha was. He bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Sāgara megha, circumambulated him many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping him to his right, sat before him, and with palms together said,
“Ārya, I am set on the highest, complete enlightenment. I seek to enter the
ocean of the highest wisdom. However, I do not know how bodhisattvas
turn away from worldly existences and attain
 the family of the tathāgatas;
how they cross the ocean of existence and enter the ocean of omniscience;
how they transcend the level of foolish, ordinary beings and attain the family
of the tathāgatas; how they turn away from the flow
 of saṃsāra and enter
the flow of bodhisattva conduct; how they turn back from the wheel of the
continuum of saṃsāra’s ocean and enter
 the wheel of bodhisattva conduct
and aspiration; how they defeat all the domains of the māras and manifest
the arising
 of all the domains of the buddhas; how they dry up the ocean
of existences and expand the ocean of great compassion; how they shut the
gateway to all unfortunate existences, lower existences, and downfalls and
open the gateway to the higher existences and nirvāṇa; how they destroy
355
356
357
358


---

the gateway to the city of the three realms and open the gateway to the
palace of omniscience; how they reject craving for all things and develop the
aspiration to gather all beings.”
5. 3
After he had said that, the bhikṣu Sāgara megha said to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, [F.329.a] “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.
“Noble one, the beings who have not planted roots of merit do not
develop the aspiration for enlightenment.359
5. 4
“The aspiration for enlightenment is developed by those beings who have
attained the complete illumination, by the roots of merit, of all gateways,
who are illuminated by the light of the wisdom of the samādhi of the path
that has the essence of methods, who have accumulated a vast accumulation
of an ocean of merit, who have a continuity of all good actions, who never
tire of relying on all the kalyāṇamitras, who have no concern for their own
bodies or lives, who are free from all fixation on things, whose minds are as
even as completely level ground, who possess a nature of compassion and
kindness, who are focused
 on all those dwelling in the states of existence,
and who long for the scope of activity of the tathāgatas.
360
5. 5
“In other words, they have developed a motivation of great compassion so
as to protect all beings. They have developed a motivation of great love so as
to treat all beings equally. They have developed the motivation to bring
happiness so as to bring to an end the mass of suffering of all beings. They
have developed the motivation to bring benefit so as to turn beings away
from all bad qualities. They have developed the motivation of sympathy so
as to protect from all fear. They have developed the motivation of
nonattachment so as to eliminate all obscurations. They have developed a
vast motivation so as to pervade the entire realm of phenomena. They have
developed an infinite motivation so as to extend throughout and be present
everywhere in the realm of space. They have developed a stainless
motivation so as to perceive the vision of all the tathāgatas. [F.329.b] They
have developed a pure motivation in order for their wisdom to extend
throughout the three times without exception. They have developed a
motivation for wisdom in order to dispel wisdom’s obscurations
 and enter
into an ocean of omniscient wisdom.
361
5. 6
“Noble one, for twelve years I have dwelled in this area called Sāgara-
mukha. I focused on the great ocean, facing it, and I contemplated the ocean
in this way: ‘It is vast and immeasurable; it is stainless and clear; it is deep
and unfathomable; it becomes steadily deeper and stays perfectly the same;
it is a source of a variety of many jewels; it is a limitless mass of water; it has


---

many different colors and is inconceivable; it has infinite spirits; it is the
dwelling place of a multitude of various creatures; it receives the rain from
great clouds; and it is neither filled nor diminished.’
5. 7
“Noble one, I thought, ‘Is there anything in this world realm that is greater
than this ocean? Is there something that is vaster, more measureless,
deeper,
 or more marvelous?’ While I was engaged in attention to this
through contemplation, there appeared a great lotus from under the great
ocean. It had a stem of unsurpassable precious sapphire jewels that was as
hard as diamond. It was adorned with great precious beryl jewels. It had vast
leaves of stainless Jambu River gold. It displayed a yellow sandalwood
pericarp
 and stamens of emerald jewels. It was as vast and large as the
ocean. A gathering of a million
 asura lords held the stem. It was covered
from above by a network of a million various jewels. [F.330.a] A million nāga
lords sent down a rain of incense. A million garuḍa lords hung from their
beaks streamers of silk and strings of jewels. A million kinnara lords looked
on with a wish to benefit. A million mahoraga lords encircled the lotus and
bowed down to it. A million rākṣasa lords bowed down and made offerings
to it. A million gandharva lords played music and sang various melodious
songs in praise and as an offering. A million deva lords sent down rain from
clouds of divine flowers, perfume, garlands, incense, ointments, powders,
clothing, parasols, banners, and divine flags. A million Brahmakāyika lords
reverently bowed their heads, paid homage, and made offerings. A million
Śuddhāvāsa devas placed their palms together and paid homage. A million
cakravartins, lords of humans, welcomed it with an offering of the seven
jewels, and a million ocean devas rose up and paid homage to it.
362
363
364
5. 8
“A million precious asteria jewels displaying light rays adorned it. A
million perfectly arranged precious jewels of pure merit
 beautified it. A
million radiant
 precious jewels were its stainless center. It blazed with a
million glorious precious jewels. It had the infinite shining of a million
variegated treasures of precious jewels. It was beautified by a perfectly
arranged display of a million precious Jambudvīpa
 jewels. [F.330.b] It had
an unsurpassable display of a million precious diamond
 jewels. It had a
plenitude of illustrious blazing precious sunstone jewels. It had an
arrangement of a million radiant precious jewels of various colors. It had the
unceasingly brightly shining display of a million precious wish-fulfilling
kings of jewels.

366
367
368
5. 9
“That great lotus had arisen from a tathāgata’s transcendent roots of merit
and remained through the aspiration of bodhisattvas. It could be perceived
in all directions. It had come forth as an illusory phenomenon. It had been
created from pure, stainless actions. It was the display of the unalloyed true
nature. It was produced like a phenomenon in a dream. It was sealed as


---

being a noncomposite phenomenon. It possessed the nature of being free of
attachment. It pervaded the domains of the directions throughout the vast
realm of phenomena. It accorded with the majestic radiance
 of the domain
of buddhahood. It would be impossible to fully comprehend its display of
form, qualities, shape, and colors even in hundreds of thousands of
asaṃkhyeya kalpas.
369
5. 10
“I saw the clear image of the body of a tathāgata sitting cross-legged on
that great lotus and filling it. I saw that tathāgata’s body extending from here
up to the summit of existence. I saw the inconceivable display of that
tathāgata’s seat. I saw the inconceivable circle of his followers, the
inconceivable extent of his halo, his inconceivable perfect primary signs of a
great being, his inconceivable various secondary features of a great being,
his inconceivable majesty and power, [F.331.a] his inconceivable miracles of
buddhahood, the inconceivable color of the tathāgata’s body, the
inconceivable invisible crown of his head,
 and his inconceivable vast
tongue.
370
5. 11
“I heard the inconceivable display of that buddha’s speech and the
inconceivable range of his voice. I comprehended his inconceivable limitless
strength, his inconceivable display of fearlessness, and his inconceivable
accomplishment of the power of discernment. I remembered his
inconceivable past accomplishment of bodhisattva conduct. I saw the
inconceivable miracle of his complete enlightenment. I heard the
inconceivable resounding of the thunder of Dharma and the inconceivable
array of the perceived communication of the complete teaching. I saw the
inconceivable, immeasurable right and left parts of his body and the
inconceivable accomplishment of a body that benefits beings.
5. 12
“That tathāgata extended his right hand and stroked my head and taught
me a Dharma teaching called All-Seeing Eyes, which is the field of all the
tathāgatas, reveals the conduct of bodhisattvas, illuminates the different
bases of the realm of phenomena,
 illuminates the compiled
 field of all
Dharmas, is the pure vision of the forms of the range of all realms, scatters
the entire range of adversaries, defeats the entire range of the discord of the
māras, [F.331.b] brings satisfaction to all realms of beings, illuminates the
darkness in the minds of all beings, communicates
 in accord with the
thoughts of all beings, and illuminates the turning wheel of the faculties of
all beings.

“I acquired, possess, follow, and contemplate this Dharma teaching called
All-Seeing Eyes.
5. 13
“Having thus acquired it, if one were to use a volume of ink equal to the
great ocean and a heap of pens the size of Sumeru, the king of mountains, to
write it out, one would not be able reach the end of a single chapter, a single

gateway, a single Dharma way, or a single category of words from that
Dharma teaching, nor could one diminish what is to be written, complete it,
finish it, or reach the end.
5. 14
“Noble one, in that way I have possessed this Dharma teaching called All-
Seeing Eyes for an entire twelve years. Having thus acquired it, in a single day
I can understand countless chapters through the illumination of the light of
the power of retention called remembering what is heard. I can comprehend
countless chapters through the illumination of the light of the power of
retention called the gateway to peace. I can fathom countless chapters through
the illumination of the light of the power of retention called endless revolving. I
can consider and investigate countless chapters through the illumination of
the light of the power of retention called examining and analyzing the levels. I

into this Dharma teaching called All-Seeing Eyes that illuminates the conduct
of the tathāgatas and bodhisattvas. For all of them I clarify, delineate,
elucidate, describe, teach,
 categorize, expand, reveal, expound, and
illuminate this Dharma teaching called All-Seeing Eyes.

“As in the east, it is the same for the beings who arrive to the south, the
west, the north, the northeast, the southeast, the southwest, the northwest,
above, and below.
5. 17
“Noble one, in this way I know but one Dharma teaching. How could I
know the conduct or describe the qualities of bodhisattvas? They have
entered the ocean of bodhisattva conduct in order to gain pure aspiration;
they have entered the ocean of all aspirations in order to remain
continuously throughout all kalpas; they have entered the ocean of all
beings in order to follow a conduct that accords with their wishes; [F.332.b]
they have entered the ocean of the minds of all beings in order to


---

communicate wisdom; they have entered the ocean of all good qualities
 in
order to develop the unimpeded radiance of the wisdom of the ten strengths;
they have entered the ocean of the faculties of all beings in order not to miss
the time for ripening and guiding them; they have entered the ocean of
realms in order to fulfill the aspiration to purify all realms; they have entered
the ocean of buddhas in order to serve and make offerings to the tathāgatas;
they have entered the ocean of Dharma in order to communicate
 wisdom;
they have entered the ocean of good qualities in order to reach attainment;
and they have entered the ocean of the languages of beings in order to turn
the wheel of the Dharma in all languages.

“Depart, noble one. Sixty yojanas from here on the road south, there is a
place named Sāgara tīra on the road to Laṅka. There dwells a bhikṣu by the
name of Supratiṣṭhita. Go to him and ask him, ‘How does a bodhisattva train
in bodhisattva conduct?’ ”
5. 19
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Sāgara megha, circumambulated the bhikṣu Sāgara megha many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back
again and again, departed from the bhikṣu Sāgara megha.

Chapter 6
SUPRATIṢṬHITA
6. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembering the instructions of
the kalyāṇamitra and the Dharma teaching called All-Seeing Eyes,
contemplating the miracles of that tathāgata, keeping in his mind the clouds
of the words and terms of that Dharma, [F.333.a] comprehending that ocean
of Dharma gateways, observing the precepts of that Dharma, entering
those ways of turning toward
 the Dharma, absorbed into the sky of that
Dharma, purifying the range of that Dharma, and meditating on the precious
continent
 of that Dharma, eventually arrived at Sāgara tīra in the Laṅka
region.
 Wishing to see the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita, he looked for him in the
eastern direction. In the same way, wishing to see the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita,
he looked for him everywhere: in the southern direction, in the western
direction, in the northern direction, in the northeastern direction, in the
southeastern direction, in the southwestern direction, in the northwestern
direction, above, and below.
377
378
379
380
6. 2
Then he saw the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita walking back and forth in the sky
accompanied by countless hundreds of thousands of devas.
6. 3
He saw deva lords in the sky making offerings to the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita
with clouds of scattered divine flower petals, the sound of countless clouds
of divine music, and countless adorning streamers and banners.
6. 4
He saw that nāga lords in the sky had created high clouds, made of the
spreading incense smoke of black agarwood, from which came
inconceivable claps of thunder.
6. 5
He heard kinnara lords offering their divine beautiful voices in songs of
praise and the sounds of a concert with all musical instruments being
played.
6. 6
He saw mahoraga lords in the sky joyfully and with faith bringing forth an
inconceivable cloud of fine clothing in beautiful colors,
 [F.333.b] with the
appearance of delighting in the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita.
381


---

6. 7
He saw asura lords in the sky conjuring an inconceivable cloud of
precious jewels shining with an inconceivable display of qualities.
6. 8
He saw a gathered multitude of garuḍa lords in human form, color,
 and
shape, encircled by the daughters of the garuḍa lords, delighting
 in
nonviolence
 and with their palms together in homage.
382
383
384
6. 9
He saw an inconceivable hundred thousand yakṣa lords, arranged with
their retinues in the sky, who had very ugly bodies and the power of love
toward the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita.
6. 10
He saw an inconceivable hundred thousand rākṣasa lords with their
retinues in the sky who circled around the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita, guarding
him.
6. 11
He saw an inconceivable hundred thousand Brahmakāyika lords with
their retinues in the sky with their palms together in homage, engaged in
singing his praises with beautiful, melodious voices.
6. 12
He saw an inconceivable hundred thousand Śuddhāvāsa devas in their
aerial palaces in the sky making offerings to the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita.
6. 13
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, on seeing the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita
walking in the sky, was filled with joy, delighted, elated, pleased, and happy.
He placed his palms together in homage and said, “Ārya, I have developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know
this —how should a bodhisattva seek for the Buddhadharma? [F.334.a] How
should a bodhisattva obtain the Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva
compile the Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva serve
 the
Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva protect
 the Buddhadharma?
How should a bodhisattva follow the Buddhadharma? How should a
bodhisattva accumulate
 the Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva
pervade
 the Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva purify the
Buddhadharma? How should a bodhisattva train in the Buddhadharma?
How should a bodhisattva understand the Buddhadharma?
385
386
387
388
389
6. 14
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas should practice
the Buddhadharma so that while practicing they will not lack the sight of the
Buddha in order to not become separated from the truth; will not lack the
vision of the bodhisattvas in order to have the same way
 as the roots of
merit of all bodhisattvas; will not lack the Buddhadharma in order to realize
wisdom; will not lack the bodhisattva aspiration in order to attain all the
goals of the bodhisattvas; will not lack bodhisattva conduct in order to never
become weary of remaining throughout all kalpas; will not lack the
pervading of all buddha realms in order to purify all world realms; [F.334.b]
will not lack seeing the miracles of buddhas in order to perceive all the
miraculous manifestations of all the tathāgatas; will not lack a composite
390


---

presence so that through bodhisattva conduct that is like a magical creation
they will experience as their own bodies the āyatanas that are born and pass
away within all existences; will not lack hearing the Dharma in order to
obtain the clouds of Dharma of all the tathāgatas; and will not lack the light
of wisdom in order to gain and use the knowledge of the three times.”391
6. 15
When he had said this, the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita said to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment and that
you ask questions about the Buddha’s Dharma, the Dharma of omniscience,
the self-arisen Dharma.
6. 16
“Noble one, I have the attainment of the unimpeded gateway, the
liberation of a bodhisattva. I have acquired, followed, categorized, analyzed,
examined, and elucidated this unimpeded gateway, this liberation of a
bodhisattva, and I have attained the light of wisdom called the unimpeded
apex. Having attained that, I have no impediment in perceiving the minds
and conduct of all beings; I have no impediment in knowing the births and
deaths of all beings; I have no impediment in entering the gateway of
remembering past lives; I have no impediment in dwelling with all beings in
future kalpas; [F.335.a] I have no impediment in perceiving all the beings of
the present time; I have no impediment in knowing the relative languages of
all beings; I have no impediment in cutting through the doubts of all beings;
I have no impediment in comprehending the different faculties of all beings;
I have no impediment in acting at the right time to ripen and guide all
beings; I have no impediment in identifying days, nights, seconds, hours,
and periods of time; I have no impediment in entering into the ocean of the
three times;
 and I have no impediment in incorporeally
 pervading the
buddha realms in the ten directions, because I am present without substance
and have attained noncomposite miraculous powers.
392
393
394
6. 17
“Noble one, because I am present without substance and have the power
of noncomposite miraculous powers, I can walk back and forth, stand,
 sit,
lie down, and perform various activities in the sky. I can become invisible. I
can reappear. I can become smoke. I can become a fire. [F.335.b] I can
transform from one into many. I can transform from many into one. I can be
both visible and invisible. I can pass without impediment through walls and
without impediment through city ramparts, as if through space.
 I travel
cross-legged through the air, as a bird does. I can plunge into the earth and
reappear the way a bird does in water. I can walk on water without sinking
like a bird on the ground. I can produce smoke and flames the way a great
fire does. I can make the ground shake. I can wipe clean with my hands this
sun and this moon that have such great miraculous power, great mightiness,
and great brilliance. My body can dominate everywhere up to and including
395
396

the world of Brahmā. I can cover the world with a mist formed from clouds of
incense smoke and then make it shine. I can cover the world with a network
of clouds of light rays from all jewels. I can send forth a cloud of emanations
that resemble all beings.
6. 18
“I can emanate clouds of networks of lights of infinite colors that go to all
directions and realms. In that way, they go to the east, to the south, to the
west, to the north, to the northeast, to the southeast, to the southwest, to the
northwest, downward, and upward. In one instant of mind, they go beyond
one world realm in the east.
6. 19
“They go beyond two world realms and ten world realms. They go beyond
a hundred world realms. They go beyond a thousand world realms, a
hundred thousand world realms, ten million world realms, a billion world
realms, a trillion world realms, a quintillion world realms, an incalculable
number of world realms, a measureless number of world realms, [F.336.a]
innumerable world realms, an inconceivable number of world realms, an
unequaled number of world realms, an unfathomable number of world
realms, an infinite number of world realms, an endless number of world
realms, limitless world realms, and an inexpressible number of world realms.
6. 20
“All the buddha bhagavats that are present, living, and remaining in those
world realms, in that ocean of world realms, in that vast extent of world
realms, in the world realms in the directions, in the world realms that are
coming to an end, in the world realms that are assembled, in the world
realms that are created, in those world realms that are named, in the
gateways of those world realms, in the kalpas of those world realms, in the
entrances into those world realms, and at the bodhimaṇḍas of those world
realms, those buddha bhagavats who are teaching the Dharma in the circle
of their assembled followers in those world realms —each of the tathāgatas
among those tathāgatas has a variety of bodies that are as numerous as the
atoms in the infinite buddha realms. I approach each of those bodies while
sending down a rain from clouds of offering as numerous as the atoms in the
infinite buddha realms. Having approached them, I make a continuous
offering of all flowers, all incense, all garlands, all powders, all ointments, all
food, all banners, all flags, all canopies, all networks of beads, and all
ornaments.397
6. 21
“I know and remember whatever all those buddha bhagavats [F.336.b] say,
teach, utter, explain, describe, elucidate, instruct, proclaim, and disclose.
6. 22
“I remember all the pure buddha realms of those buddha bhagavats. As it
is in the east, so it is in the south, the west, the north, the northeast, the
southeast, the southwest, the northwest, above and below, beyond one

world realm, beyond two world realms and ten world realms, beyond a
hundred world realms, and so on, up to beyond as many world realms as
there are atoms in even more innumerable than innumerable buddha realms.
6. 23
“I see all the buddha bhagavats that are present, living, and remaining in
those world realms, in that ocean of world realms, in those pure world
realms, who are teaching the Dharma in the circle of their followers. I make
offerings to those tathāgatas with all flowers, and so on, up to all
ornaments.
 I know and remember whatever all those buddha bhagavats
say, and so on, and what they disclose. I remember all the pure buddha
realms that there are of those buddha bhagavats.
398
6. 24
“Whatever being sees me, who associates with me, will definitely attain
the highest, complete enlightenment. [F.337.a] Whether they are small or
huge, good or bad, happy or unhappy beings, however many of them see
me, I will bless all of their bodies and I will not let the time to ripen and
guide them pass. However many beings come before me, I will establish all
of them in this bodhisattva liberation that goes everywhere and has fruitful
prowess.
6. 25
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation that goes everywhere,
which is dedicated to making offerings and serving the tathāgatas and
which is an unimpeded gateway favorable for ripening all beings.
6. 26
“How could I know or describe the qualities of the bodhisattvas who have
the conduct of great compassion, who have the conduct of practicing the
Mahāyāna, who have the conduct that is never apart from the path of the
bodhisattvas, who have unimpeded conduct, who have the conduct of the
essence of bodhisattva motivation that is never lost, who have the conduct
that never forsakes the aspiration to enlightenment, who have the conduct
that is focused on the Buddhadharma, who have the conduct that is never
apart from attention to omniscience, who have the conduct that is as vast as
space, who have the conduct that is not based on the world, who have the
conduct that is never lost, who have the conduct that never deteriorates,
who have the conduct that is never impaired, who have the conduct that is
never destroyed, who have the conduct that is never adulterated, who have
the conduct that is never polluted, who have the conduct that is without
regret, who have pure conduct, and who have bodhisattva conduct that is
stainless? [F.337.b]
6. 27
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land of Draviḍa, there is
a town called Vajrapura. There dwells a Dravidian by the name of Megha. Go
to him and ask him, ‘How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How does a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”


---

6. 28
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita, circumambulated the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita to his right a
hundred thousand times, and, looking back a hundred thousand times,
departed from the bhikṣu Supratiṣṭhita.

Chapter 7
MEGHA
7. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was filled with the power and might of
faith in the Dharma. He was focused on the idea of following the Buddha; he
was sincerely dedicated to the lineage of the Three Jewels; his mind
illuminated the worlds of the three times;
 he was focused on following the
great aspiration; he was continuously dedicated
 to saving all the realms of
beings; his mind did not dwell on composite pleasures;
 he was devoted to
contemplating the nature of all phenomena; he never deviated from the
aspiration to purify all world realms; he dwelled without attachment in the
circles of the assemblies of all the buddhas; he remembered the light of the
Dharma;
 he remembered his kalyāṇamitras;
 and he proclaimed the
lineage of freedom from desire.
399
400
401
402
403
404
7. 2
Eventually he arrived at Vajrapura in the Draviḍa region. He searched and
searched for the Dravidian Megha until he saw him in one of the courtyards
in the town. He was seated on a lion throne in order to teach the Dharma,
and he was teaching the Dharma teaching called the display of the rotating
wheel of syllables to about ten thousand beings. [F.338.a]
7. 3
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
Dravidian Megha, circumambulated the Dravidian Megha to his right many
hundreds of thousands of times, sat before him, and with palms together
said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment. However, I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct; how they should practice it; how bodhisattvas do not
lose the aspiration to enlightenment; how they keep their motivation firm
within all the states of existence so that they do not lose heart;
 how they
purify their resolve so that they do not become oppressed; how they develop
the power of great compassion so that they do not lose heart; how they gain
the power of retention so that all gateways are purified; how they develop
the light of wisdom, the light that frees all phenomena from darkness, so that
405


---

the darkness that obscures omniscience will be dispersed; how they gain the
power of discernment so that they perfect the domain of voice through being
skilled in meaning, Dharma, definitions, and eloquence; how they gain the
power of memory so that they will possess without differentiation all the
Buddha’s Dharma wheels; how they purify states of rebirth
 so that they
will realize and follow the light in all rebirths and phenomena in all
directions; and how the power of bodhisattvas’ samādhi is brought forth so
as to have the highest certainty and analysis of all the meanings of the
Dharma.”
406
7. 4
Then the Dravidian Megha, [F.338.b] in order to show respect to the
bodhisattva, rose from his throne, stepped down, and with his entire body
prostrated before Sudhana, the head merchant’s son. He scattered a heap of
golden flowers toward Sudhana, the head merchant’s son. He scattered
many priceless precious jewels and supreme sandalwood powder. He
draped him in many hundreds of thousands of cloths that had been dyed in
various colors. He scattered many beautiful and delightful perfumed flowers
of many different colors. He also made offerings with other kinds of
offerings, showing him respect, honor, and veneration.
7. 5
He said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent,
excellent, that you have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment and that you have an unceasing dedication to the lineage of
all the buddhas, you are dedicated to correctly imparting knowledge of the
lineage of freedom from desire, you practice the purification of the classes of
realms, you are prepared for ripening and guiding all classes of beings, you
are dedicated to correctly examining all the traditions of the Dharma, you
maintain a state of not contravening all the classes of karma, you are
dedicated to perfecting the classes of bodhisattva conduct, you correctly
engage in a continuity of all classes of prayers, you engage in
comprehending through wisdom all the classes of three times, and you are
dedicated to making firm the classes of motivations. [F.339.a]
7. 6
“That is the blessing of all the many tathāgatas, that is the intention of all
the buddhas, that is the attainment of equality of all the bodhisattvas, that is
what all the āryas rejoice in, that is what delights all the Brahmakāyika lords,
that is what is offered to by all the deva lords, that is what is protected by all
the yakṣa lords, that is what is honored by all the rākṣasa lords, that is what
is welcomed by all the nāga lords, that is what is praised by all the kinnara
lords, and that is what is praised by all the lords of the world.
7. 7
“It is what prevents the entire realm of beings from being reborn in the
three lower existences and turns them away from all paths to unfortunate
and lower existences. It turns them away from the paths that lead to poverty.
It brings the attainment of the good fortune of devas and humans.


---

7. 8
“Through it there will be no separation from seeing the kalyāṇamitra, no
separation from the vast ocean of the Buddhadharma; it purifies the
aspiration for enlightenment, it accomplishes the cause
 of the aspiration
for enlightenment, it obtains the illumination of the bodhisattva path, it
brings the realization of bodhisattva wisdom, and it brings the relief of being
on the level of a bodhisattva.
407
7. 9
“Noble one, this is what I think: the bodhisattvas accomplish what is
difficult, they are the manifestation of a sight that is difficult to obtain, and
they are a comfort to the world; [F.339.b] the bodhisattvas are like fathers and
mothers to all beings; the bodhisattvas are like adornments for this world
and its paradises; the bodhisattvas save beings from the torments of
suffering; the bodhisattvas remain in order to protect all beings; the
bodhisattvas are a refuge
 from the misfortune of various kinds of danger;
the bodhisattvas are like the disk of air
 because it prevents beings from
falling into the lower existences; the bodhisattvas are like the earth because
they increase the roots of merit of all beings; the bodhisattvas are like the
ocean because they contain an inexhaustible treasure of precious merit; the
bodhisattvas are like the sun because they shine with the light of wisdom;
the bodhisattvas are like Sumeru because of the great height of their roots of
merit; the bodhisattvas are like the moon because they rise as the moon of
the wisdom of the essence of enlightenment; the bodhisattvas are like
warriors because they defeat the armies of the māras; the bodhisattvas are
like heroes because they reach the self-arisen city of the Dharma; the
bodhisattvas are like Agni because they dry up the wetness of the self-
love
 of all beings; the bodhisattvas are like clouds because they send
down rain from the vast cloud of the Dharma; the bodhisattvas are like rain
because they increase the sprouts of the faculties, faith, and so on of beings;
the bodhisattvas are like mariners because they reveal the point of
embarkation for crossing the ocean of the Dharma; [F.340.a] the bodhisattvas
are like a bridge because they enable all beings to cross over the ocean of
saṃsāra; and the bodhisattvas are like fords because they enable beings to
cross over.”
408
409
410
7. 10
In that way, Megha the Dravidian, while sitting before Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, praised the bodhisattvas with those words and
congratulated Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
7. 11
As he was proclaiming those words that brought delight to bodhisattvas, a
mass of light rays was emitted from his mouth in this fashion: that mass of
light rays spread throughout the billion worlds. Those beings who saw it
and were illuminated by that great radiance —devas and devas with great
miraculous power, nāgas and nāgas with great miraculous power, yakṣas
and yakṣas with great miraculous power, gandharvas and gandharvas with


---

great miraculous power, asuras and asuras with great miraculous power,
garuḍas and garuḍas with great miraculous power, kinnaras and kinnaras
with great miraculous power, mahoragas and mahoragas with great
miraculous power, humans and humans with great miraculous power,
nonhumans and nonhumans with great miraculous power, Brahmakāyikas
and Brahmakāyikas with great miraculous power —came into the presence of
Megha the Dravidian.
7. 12
Their thoughts were thus blessed by Megha the Dravidian, and they
placed their palms together in homage. Their bodies and minds were
refreshed, they felt vast joy, they showed great veneration, they had cast
down the banner of pride,
 they were free of deceit, and their senses were
serene. Megha the Dravidian taught them extensively the Dharma teaching
called The Display of the Rotating Wheel of Syllables. [F.340.b] He made it known
to them, introduced them to it, led them into it, and caused them to
understand it.
 Having heard it, they all gained irreversible progress
toward the highest, complete enlightenment.
411
412
7. 13
Then Megha the Dravidian sat again upon the Dharma throne and said to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, I have attained Sarasvatī’s
power of retention. Through its power I know the divine languages of the
devas in these world realms of the billion-world universe. In the same way, I
know the languages of the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans and the Brahmakāyika
language of the Brahmakāyika devas.
7. 14
“I know the various divine languages of the devas, and similarly I know
the various languages of the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, 
mahoragas, 
humans, 
and 
nonhumans 
and 
the 
various
Brahmakāyika languages of the Brahmakāyika devas.
7. 15
“I know the different divine languages of the devas, and similarly I know
the different languages of the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans and the different
Brahmakāyika languages of the Brahmakāyika devas.
7. 16
“I also know the different signs, languages, and names of the beings who
have been reborn as animals. I also know the different languages and names
of the beings who have been reborn in the hells. I also know the different
languages and names of the beings in the realm of Yama.
 [F.341.a] I also
know the languages and names of the āryas. I also know the languages and
names of those who are not āryas. I also know the words, signs, and
definitions of bodhisattvas that arise in accordance with the wishes of
beings.
413

7. 17
“In each instant of mind, I perceive and comprehend the aspects of the
voices and the oceans of speech of all the tathāgatas in the three times, and
the words, the sound of conversations, and the languages that are used by
all beings.
7. 18
“Just as I perceive and know the ocean of terms, definitions, languages,
and names of beings in this world realm of a billion worlds, in the same way,
I perceive and know the ocean of terms, definitions, languages, and names
of beings in a quintillion world realms, a measureless number of world
realms, innumerable world realms, an inconceivable number of world realms,
an unequaled number of world realms, an infinite number of world realms,
limitless world realms, and an inexpressible number of world realms in the
eastern direction, and it is the same for the south, the west, the north, the
northeast, the southeast, the southwest, the northwest, below, and above.
7. 19
“In that way, I know the deva language of the devas, and so on, up to
knowing the Brahmakāyika language of the Brahmakāyika devas.
7. 20
“Noble one, I know the light of Sarasvatī’s power of retention that the
bodhisattvas have, but how could I know the conduct or describe the
qualities of the entry by the bodhisattvas into an ocean of different terms,
[F.341.b] their entry into an ocean of terms and languages of various beings,
their entry into an ocean of taught names of various beings, their entry into
an ocean of an array of descriptions by various beings, their entry into an
ocean of conducts, their entry into an ocean of the conjunctions of all words,
their entry into an ocean of the literal meaning of words, their entry into an
ocean of single terms for perceptions that include all perceptions in the three
times, their entry into an ocean of teaching through assembling a single
word,
 their entry into an ocean of teaching through assembling two
words,
 their entry into an ocean of teaching through dividing words, their
entry into an ocean of teaching that brings guidance through categorizing
the words
 for all phenomena, their entry into an ocean of the languages of
all beings, their entry in the entire pure display of the field of speech, and
what arises in the categories of the apex of the wheel of words?
414
415
416
7. 21
“Now depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land of Vanavāsī,
there dwells a head merchant by the name of Muktaka. Go to him and ask
him, ‘How should bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct? How should
they set forth? How should their minds rest in meditation?’ ”
7. 22
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
Megha the Dravidian, and showing respect for his Dharma, showing that
Megha was the source for the signs of the arising of his faith, and seeing the
omniscience that has come from the kalyāṇamitra, [F.342.a] weeping, with


---

his face covered in tears, he circumambulated Megha the Dravidian a
hundred thousand times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back a

MUKTAKA
8. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, then contemplated that power of
retention of the bodhisattvas called the light that is the display of Sarasvatī,
remembered that particular entry by the bodhisattvas into an ocean of
languages, remembered that particular entry by the bodhisattvas into the
way of subtlety,
 remembered that particular purity of the bodhisattvas
through 
purification 
of 
the 
mind, 
accomplished 
that 
particular
accomplishment by the bodhisattvas of creating the predispositions for roots
of merit, purified that particular bodhisattva gateway for ripening, refined
that particular bodhisattva wisdom that attracts beings, made firmer that
particular pure strength of bodhisattva motivation, stabilized that particular
strength of the superior motivation of the bodhisattvas, purified that lineage
of bodhisattva aspiration, developed
 that particular goodness that is in the
minds of the bodhisattvas, and entered into that particular commitment of
the bodhisattvas.
417
418
8. 2
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, displayed a continuity of strong
commitment, a mind of aspiration, and indefatigability. He had the
heroism
 of irreversible courage. He had the commitment of an irreversible
mind. He possessed the strength of unassailable faith. His motivation had
the indestructibility of the mighty vajra. [F.342.b] He had acquired with
reverence the instructions of all kalyāṇamitras. He had an unimpaired scope
of wisdom. He faced the completely pure gateways. He possessed the
unimpeded field of pure wisdom. He had the illumination of all-seeing
wisdom. He had attained the radiance of the retentive power of all levels.
His mind faced the separate bases of the realm of phenomena. He perceived
the nature of the pure display that is completely without any basis. He was
devoted to the unattached, unequaled,
 nondual field of activity. He had
the pure gateway of wisdom that surpasses all concepts. He had the
discrimination
 of all
 the separate directions and families.
 He had not

annulled the separate bases and directions of the world. He had not
annulled the separate bases and directions of the Dharma. He was dedicated
to the perception of the vision of the different directions and families
 of
the buddhas. He had the wisdom that comprehended the different directions
and bases of time. He had the understanding endowed with the radiance of
the wheel of the Dharma. The light of the complete radiance of wisdom and
samādhi illuminated his mind. He had the mind and body
 that had
reached the complete levels and ranges. He was continuously illuminated by
the radiance
 of the wisdom of the tathāgatas. He had given rise to the
power of faith in omniscience. He was never lacking in the power of faith in
the Buddhadharma. He possessed the blessing of the tathāgatas. He had
been illuminated by the light of the approach of his own mind to the
buddhas. He was endowed with the aspiration for his own body pervading
the network of all world realms. He was dedicated to accomplishing the
inclusion of the entire realm of phenomena within his own body.
424
425
426
8. 3
After twelve years [F.343.a] he eventually arrived at Vanavāsī. He
searched for the head merchant Muktaka and saw him. When he saw him, he
bowed down his entire body onto the ground in homage and sat before him.
8. 4
With palms together he said, “Ārya, today I have succeeded; I have
succeeded well. Why is that? Because I have met the kalyāṇamitra.
 It is
rare to have the opportunity to see the kalyāṇamitras. It is rare to have the
opportunity to find their appearance. It is rare to have the opportunity to
arrive where they are. It is rare to have the opportunity to go to where they
are, it is rare to have the opportunity to serve them, it is rare to have the
opportunity to approach
 them, it is rare to have the opportunity to dwell
with them, it is rare to have the opportunity to train with them, and it is rare
to have the opportunity to follow the kalyāṇamitras.
427
428
8. 5
“Today I have succeeded in being with the kalyāṇamitra.
 Ārya, I have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment in order to
serve all the buddhas; to venerate all the buddhas; to see all the buddhas; to
perceive all the buddhas; to comprehend the equality of all the buddhas; to
comprehend the prayers of all the buddhas; to fulfill the prayers of all the
buddhas; to have the light of the wisdom accomplished by all the buddhas;
to accomplish all buddhas within my own body; to accomplish the
knowledge of all the buddhas in my own conduct; to have the direct
perception of the miracles of all the buddhas; to purify the strengths and
fearlessnesses of all the buddhas; to never have enough of hearing the
Dharma that is taught by all the buddhas; [F.343.b] to hear and adopt the
Dharma that is taught by all the buddhas; to truly hold the Dharma that is
taught by all the buddhas; to become the same as all the bodhisattvas;
 to
be included among the bodhisattvas; to purify the conduct of all
429
430


---

bodhisattvas; to fulfill the perfections of all bodhisattvas; to purify the
accomplishment of the aspirations of all bodhisattvas; to attain the treasure
of the buddha blessings of all the bodhisattvas; to obtain the unceasing light
of wisdom that is all the bodhisattvas’ store of treasure of the Dharma; to
realize all the bodhisattvas’ store of treasure of samādhi;
 to accomplish the
immeasurable treasure of all the bodhisattvas; to realize all the bodhisattvas’
store of treasure of great compassion, which is the definitive guiding of
beings; to perceive all the bodhisattvas’ store of treasure of miracles; and to
gain the power in my own mind that is all the bodhisattvas’ store of power;
and for the array of all the aspects of all the bodhisattvas’ store of treasure of
purity.
431
8. 6
“Ārya, I have come here with such a motivation, [F.344.a] with such an
intention, with such joy,
 with such delight, with such thoughts, with such
an aspiration to accomplish certainty, with such an aspiration to conduct,
with such an aspiration to comprehend the way, with such a dedication to
purity, with such an intention for analysis,
 with such an oriented mind,
with such a dedication to goodness, and with senses focused in that way.
432
433
8. 7
“Ārya, I have heard
 that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas, that you teach the way, elucidate the way to understand, teach
the path, bring across the ford, open the gateway of the Dharma, cut through
doubts, dispel uncertainty, extract the splinter of prevarication, remove
hesitancy, illuminate the darkness of the mind, eliminate the stains of the
mind, clarify the continuity of the mind, remove the deception of the mind,
alleviate the distress of the mind, turn the mind away from saṃsāra, lead
away from bad actions, dissuade from going to the hells, bring freedom from
existence, liberate from attachment, banish all clinging, create the aspiration
for omniscience, enable entry into the city of the Dharma, bring to great
compassion, unite with great love, conjoin with bodhisattva conduct, cause
to enter the meditation of the gateway of samādhi, establish in the gateway
of realization, [F.344.b] establish in the comprehension of nature, spread the
possession of the strengths, and realize the equality of all beings.
434
8. 8
“Therefore, now that I have heard that, teach me, Ārya, how bodhisattvas
should learn
 bodhisattva conduct, how they train in it, how they are
dedicated to it, and how they quickly
 purify the domain of bodhisattva
conduct.”
435
436
8. 9
Then, at that time, the head merchant Muktaka the bodhisattva entered
the gateway of samādhi, the foremost gateway to the infinite circling of the
power of retention, called the assembly of all buddha realms, through the power
of past roots of merit, through the blessing of the tathāgatas, and through
the concentration that brings the light of wisdom of Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta.


---

8. 10
Immediately, the form of the head merchant Muktaka, who had entered
that samādhi, became a pure body. Because of the purity of his body, there
appeared within his body the presence of buddha bhagavats as numerous as
the atoms in the buddha realms in the ten directions, together with their
pure buddha realms, the assemblies of their pupils, their pure halos, their
past practice of conduct, their buddha miracles, their accumulation of
prayers, their pure display of conduct and setting forth, their demonstration
of the attainment of buddhahood, their teaching the wheel of the Dharma,
their ripening of beings, and their final conclusion of the Dharma.
8. 11
They were distinct from each other, [F.345.a] were not obscuring each
other,
 were perfectly separate from each other, were differentiated from
each other, remaining in different ways,
 and were perceived exactly as
they were. Their various arrays of buddha realms, the various adorning
assemblies of bodhisattva pupils, and the appearances of various buddha
miracles were seen.
437
438
8. 12
They were establishing the various yānas and reciting the various
gateways of prayers. They were seen in some worlds being born in a palace
in Tuṣita. They were seen to accomplish all the deeds of a buddha: in some
worlds they were descending from the palace in Tuṣita; in some they were
entering their mothers’ wombs and manifesting various miracles; in some
they were being born; in some they demonstrated playing as children; in
some they were in the middle of their harems; in some they were setting
forth in renunciation; in some they were arriving at the bodhimaṇḍa; in some
they were defeating the armies of Māra with vast miraculous manifestations;
in some they were encircled by devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas, and
Brahmā and Indra
 were supplicating them to turn the wheel of the
Dharma; in some they were turning the wheel of the Dharma; in some they
were present in the abodes of all beings; and in some they were passing into
nirvāṇa. In some world realms there could be seen the distribution of the
relics of the tathāgatas that had passed into nirvāṇa, and in some buddha
realms devas and humans could be seen covering the caityas of the
tathāgatas with adornments.
439
8. 13
Those buddha bhagavats were teaching among the various classes of
beings, the various worlds of beings, [F.345.b] the various modes of beings,
the various births of beings, the various aggregations of beings, the various
successive roots of merit of beings, the various successive modes of beings,
the various successive thoughts of beings, the various successive
aspirations of beings, the various successive sensory faculties of beings, the
various successive times of beings, the various particular karmas of beings,
the various dissimilar karmas of beings, the various worlds of beings, the


---

various modes and conducts of beings, the various aspirations and conducts
in the ocean of beings, the various, different pure faculties, and the various
kleśas, predispositions, and propensities in the vast extent of beings.
8. 14
They did so through the demonstration of various kinds of buddha
miracles, through the accomplishment of the various word definitions in
various worlds, through various aspects of voice and language in various
worlds, through relating the ways of various sūtras, through the processes
of the various kinds of gateways to the power of retention, through the
production of various kinds of discernment, through the processes of an
ocean of various names for the truth, through various majestic lion’s roars of
the buddhas, through the demonstration of miracles that teach the roots of
merit to beings, through miracles that teach the various gateways of
memory, through the lion’s roar of various prophecies to bodhisattvas, and
through the power that arises from the various Dharma wheels of the
tathāgatas.
8. 15
The buddha bhagavats taught through the aspects of the voice of a
tathāgata and in accordance with all languages in the various assemblies of
pupils —which are limitless, infinitely different, and dependent on one
another —in the various vast, pure assemblies of pupils, [F.346.a] in the
gatherings of small assemblies of pupils, among those that are the length of
one yojana, the length of ten yojanas, the length of a hundred yojanas, and
so on, up to assemblies of pupils that are as many yojanas as there are atoms
in even more countless than countless buddha realms.
8. 16
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, heard, adopted, kept, and
contemplated all those Dharmas that were taught. He also saw those buddha
miracles. He saw the power of the majesty of that bodhisattva samādhi.
8. 17
Then the head merchant Muktaka mindfully and with awareness arose
from his samādhi and said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one,
I have obtained and hold the liberation of the tathāgatas called the unimpeded
display.
8. 18
“Noble one, when in that way I strove for and attained
 the liberation of
the tathāgatas called the unimpeded display, to my eyes appeared the tathāgata
arhat samyak saṃbuddha named Tāreśvararāja in the eastern world realm
called Jāmbū nada prabhāsa vatī. He was accompanied by an assembly that
was all bodhisattvas, such as the bodhisattva Vairocana garbha.
440
8. 19
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Samanta gandha vitāna in the southern world realm called Sarva bala vegavatī.
[F.346.b] He was accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas,
such as the bodhisattva Cintārāja.


---

8. 20
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Meru pradīpa rāja in the western world realm called Sarva gandha prabhāsa-
vatī. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas, such as
the bodhisattva Asaṅga citta.
8. 21
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Vajra pramardana in the northern world realm called Kāṣāyadhvajā. He was
accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas, such as the
bodhisattva Vajra pada vikrāmin.
8. 22
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Anilambha cakṣurvairocana
 in the northeastern world realm called Sarva-
ratna rucirā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas,
such as the bodhisattva Anilambha sunirmita.
441
8. 23
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Gandhapradīpa in the southeastern world realm called Gandhārciḥ prabhā-
svarā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas, such
as the bodhisattva Sarva dharma dhātu tala bheda ketu rāja.
 [F.347.a]
442
8. 24
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Samanta mukha jñāna virocana ghoṣa in the southwestern world realm called
Sūrya kesara nirbhāsā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all
bodhisattvas, such as the bodhisattva Samanta kusumārciḥ pralamba cūḍa.
8. 25
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Apramāṇa guṇa sāgara prabha in the northwestern world realm called
Gandhālaṃkāra rucira śubha garbhā. He was accompanied by an assembly
that was all bodhisattvas, such as the bodhisattva Asaṅga kāya raśmi-
tejomati.443
8. 26
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Dharma dhātu vidyotita raśmi in the world realm below called Ratna-
siṃhāvabhāsa jvalanā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all
bodhisattvas, 
such 
as 
the 
bodhisattva 
Dharma dhātvarcirvairocana-
saṃbhava mati.
8. 27
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Apratihata guṇa kīrti vimokṣa prabha rāja in the world realm above called
Akṣaṇa rucira vairocanā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all
bodhisattvas, such as the bodhisattva Asaṅga bala vīrya mati. [F.347.b]
8. 28
“Noble one, in that way, in addition to these ten
 tathāgatas, I see in the
ten directions tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddhas as numerous as the
atoms in the buddha realms in the ten directions, but those tathāgatas have
not come here and I have not gone there.
444
8. 29
“When I wish to, I see the Tathāgata Amitābha in the buddha realm
Sukhāvatī, I see the Tathāgata Vajrābha in the buddha realm Candana vatī, I
see the Tathāgata Ratnābha in the buddha realm Gandhavatī, I see the


---

Tathāgata Ratnapadmābha in the buddha realm Padmavatī, I see the
Tathāgata Śantābha in the buddha realm Kanaka vatī, I see the Tathāgata
Akṣobhya in the buddha realm Abhiratī, I see the Tathāgata Siṃha in the
buddha realm Supratiṣṭhā, I see the Tathāgata Candra buddhi in the buddha
realm Ādarśa maṇḍala nibhāsā, and I see the Tathāgata Vairocana in the
buddha realm Ratna śrī haṃsa citrā.445
8. 30
“Noble one, in that way, I see whatever tathāgata I wish to, in whatever
direction, in whatever world realm. I see whatever tathāgata I wish to, in
whatever time, in whatever location,
 in whatever past conduct. I see
whatever tathāgata I wish to, wherever he is accomplishing miracles
[F.348.a] or wherever he is guiding beings. And those tathāgatas have not
come here, nor have I gone there.
446
8. 31
“Noble one, in that way, I know that the tathāgatas have not come from
anywhere. I know my own body has not gone anywhere. I know that
perceiving the tathāgatas is like a dream, and I know that perceiving the
activity of my own mind is like having a dream. I know that the perception of
the tathāgatas is like a reflection, and I know that my own mind’s perception
is like a bowl of clear water. I know that the perception of the tathāgatas is
like that of forms created by a magical illusion, and I know that my own
mind’s perception is like a magical illusion. I know that the speech of the
tathāgatas is like echoes that sound in the mountains, and I know that my
own mind’s perception is like an echo.
8. 32
“It is thus that I understand, thus that I know that the entire
Buddhadharma of the bodhisattvas arises from the blessing of one’s own
mind. All the pure buddha realms are the blessing of one’s own mind. The
bodhisattva conduct also is the blessing of one’s own mind. The ripening
and guidance of all beings is the blessing of one’s own mind. The fulfillment
of the aspirations of the bodhisattvas is the blessing of one’s own mind.
Arriving at the city of omniscience is the blessing of one’s own mind.
[F.348.b] Delighting in inconceivable liberations is the blessing of one’s own
mind. At attainment, the enlightenment of buddhahood is the blessing of
one’s own mind. The miraculous manifestation of the powerful majesty of
uniting the entire realm of phenomena is the blessing of one’s own mind.
The wisdom that unites all kalpas into a brief time is the blessing of one’s
own mind.
8. 33
“Noble one, this is what I think: one’s own mind should be supported by
all roots of merit, one’s own mind should be moistened by the clouds of the
Dharma, one’s own mind should be purified of obscuring phenomena,
one’s own mind should be made firm by diligence, one’s own mind should
be made tranquil by patience, one’s own mind should be cultivated by the
comprehension of knowledge, one’s own mind should be refined by
447


---

wisdom, one’s own mind should have accomplishment in power, one’s own
mind should be made vast in the equality of the buddhas, and one’s own
mind should be illuminated by the ten strengths of the tathāgatas.
8. 34
“Noble one, I know, have adopted, and keep this liberation called the
unimpeded display of the tathāgatas, but how could I know or describe the
qualities of dwelling without impediment in the field of activity of the
unimpeded minds of the bodhisattvas; the attainment of the samādhi of the
direct perception of all the buddhas in the present; the attainment of the
samādhi gateway to the enlightenment that has reached the apex that is
without passing into nirvāṇa; [F.349.a] the attainment of the sameness of the
three times; the knowledge of the way of the field of activity of the samādhi
of the completely undivided basis; the bodies distributed throughout all
buddha realms; the presence in the indivisible ranges of the buddhas; the
field of activity that is oriented toward all directions; the view of the domain
of undivided wisdom; and the conduct that is free of the dualistic
conceptions of self and world, even though in their bodies there appears the
destruction and creation of all world realms?
8. 35
“Now depart, noble one. On this road to the south, at the tip of
Jambudvīpa, there is Milaspharaṇa. There dwells a bhikṣu by the name of
Sāgara dhvaja. Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva proceed?’ ”
8. 36
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
head merchant Muktaka, circumambulated the head merchant Muktaka a
hundred thousand times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again
and again, beautifully describing, examining, and aspiring to the countless
qualities of the head merchant Muktaka, thinking of Muktaka, [F.349.b] he
was weeping and wailing as he departed from head merchant Muktaka; he
was thinking of kalyāṇamitras with affection, trusting in them, longing to
honor the kalyāṇamitras, maintaining obedience to the instructions of
kalyāṇamitras, 
and 
seeing 
omniscience 
as 
dependent 
upon 
the
kalyāṇamitras; his thoughts focused on the kalyāṇamitras, his conduct
faithful to the kalyāṇamitras, and being in the power of the minds of the
kalyāṇamitras, by avoiding anything that would be harmful to the
kalyāṇamitras he regarded them as his mother and, by developing all the
qualities of roots of merit, regarded them as his father.

Chapter 9
SĀGARA DHVAJA
9. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplated the teaching of the head
merchant Muktaka and dedicated himself to the instructions of the head
merchant Muktaka. He followed the inconceivable bodhisattva liberations.
He called to mind the inconceivable radiance of bodhisattva wisdom. He
practiced entering and comprehending the inconceivable realm of the
Dharma. He comprehended the inconceivable bodhisattva methods of
gathering pupils. He reflected on the inconceivable miracles of the
tathāgatas. He aspired to the inconceivable aggregation of buddha realms.
He contemplated the display of the blessings of the buddhas. He examined
the inconceivable majestic power of the display of samādhis and liberations.
He was dedicated to entering inconceivable separate, unobscured world
realms. He developed the aspiration for inconceivable, enduring bodhisattva
activity. And he adopted the inconceivable continuum of bodhisattva activity
and prayer.
9. 2
Eventually he reached Milaspharaṇa at the tip of Jambudvīpa. [F.350.a] He
searched and searched for the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja.
9. 3
Sudhana saw him sitting at the end of a meditation walkway. He was
resting in samādhi with no inhalation or exhalation of breath, unmoving,
inactive, sitting with his body upright, and manifesting mindfulness. With
the inconceivable miraculous powers of samādhi, he miraculously
manifested an inconceivable, immeasurable, infinite body to the right, left,
and above, so that the crown of his head was beyond sight.
 His body had
many colors, manifesting countless different colors in each instant of the
mind.
448
9. 4
Sudhana saw that as Sāgara dhvaja rested in that way in a profound,
peaceful, motionless,
 objectless meditation, from all the pores of his
body,
 which had become tall through joy,
 countless miraculous
manifestations of bodhisattva liberation appeared.
449
450
451


---

9. 5
In every single instant of mind, those miraculous manifestations from the
gateway of liberation spread throughout the realm of phenomena, in order
that those infinite miraculous manifestations would ripen all beings, make
offerings to all the tathāgatas, purify all buddha realms, eliminate the mass of
suffering of all beings, close all the paths to the lower existences, open the
paths to happiness for all beings, end the affliction of the kleśas for all
beings, disperse the obscuration of ignorance in all beings, and establish all
beings in omniscience.
9. 6
Sudhana saw assemblies of head merchants, as numerous as the atoms in
countless buddha realms, being emanated from the soles of Sāgara dhvaja’s
feet. [F.350.b] They attended and waited on him in various ways, and,
appearing to be all the head merchants from all world realms, forming an
exceptional field of activity, their bodies were adorned by a variety of
ornaments with various kinds of topknots, crest jewels, and crowns, and
they were accompanied by the images of entourages of their children.
9. 7
Sudhana also saw attending brahmins and householders, each with
different kinds of food and drink with combinations of various flavors,
 all
adornments, all clothes, all flowers, all garlands, all perfumes, all ointments,
all desirable things, all jewels, all seats, all vessels of various kinds, and all
kinds of utensils. They were emanated out into the ten directions, where
they were gathering poor people and relieving beings of their suffering,
purifying the thoughts of beings, satisfying the minds of beings, and
ripening beings for enlightenment.
452
9. 8
Sudhana saw Sāgara dhvaja’s knees emanating and filling the ten direction
with the forms of wise kṣatriyas, the forms of wise brahmins, the forms of
those who were wise in worldly matters, the forms of those wise in various
arts and crafts, the forms of those wise concerning human existence, the
forms of those wise with the knowledge of carrying out both worldly and
nonworldly practices, and the forms of those wise in honorable worldly
conduct, taking on various forms, displaying the presence of many forms,
speaking with pleasant words, making unhappy beings happy, [F.351.a]
caring for poor beings devoid of the wealth of the Dharma, making beings
who are suffering happy, elevating beings who have fallen down, bringing
relief to those who are shipwrecked, saving beings who are in fear,
sounding out the words of all roots of merit, emitting the words of turning
away from bad actions, bringing beings to the adoption of good qualities,
establishing beings in beneficial conduct, engendering the power of joy,
emitting pleasant words that are a method of gathering pupils, and showing
consistency of words and actions
 to the world.
453

9. 9
Sudhana saw, issuing forth from Sāgara dhvaja’s navel, a multitude of ṛṣis
manifesting as the bodies of all beings, wearing robes of antelope skins
and bark, holding staffs and burl bowls,
 with various forms, features, and
appearances,
 and having a peaceful deportment.
454
455
456
9. 10
From up in the sky they were proclaiming the qualities of a buddha,
speaking the word Dharma, uttering the word Buddha, teaching the
bodhisattva Saṅgha, describing the path of celibacy, establishing beings in
restraining the senses, expounding
 the meaning of the absence of
intrinsic nature, establishing the world in the meaning of wisdom, guiding in
the ways of worldly treatises, teaching the way of the path that gives rise to
omniscience, and establishing beings in the succession of practices.
[F.351.b]
457
458
9. 11
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw, issuing forth from the sides of
Sāgara dhvaja’s upper body, nāga maidens as numerous as all the worlds in
existence, and in each instant of mind pervading the entire realm of
phenomena. They were appearing as inconceivably numerous bodies,
manifesting an inconceivable number of nāga miracles, establishing in the
sky an inconceivable adornment of clouds of scented water, adorning the
sky with the inconceivable adornment of clouds of flowers, arraying the
entire sky with the inconceivable adornment of clouds of garlands, and
covering the entire realm of phenomena with the inconceivable adornment
of clouds of precious parasols; with the inconceivable adornment of clouds
of precious banners; with the inconceivable adornment of clouds of precious
streamers; with the inconceivable adornment of the rain from clouds of
various pendant ornaments; with the inconceivable adornment of the rain
from clouds of excellent precious jewels; with the inconceivable adornment
of the rain from clouds of various precious necklaces and flowers; with the
inconceivable adornment of the rain from clouds of the Dharma of buddhas
and bodhisattvas seated cross-legged on precious thrones; with the
inconceivable adornment of the rain from clouds of the sound of the Dharma
songs of a multitude of apsarases wearing a variety of divine, precious
jewelry; with the inconceivable adornment
 of the scattering rain from
clouds of precious lotuses adorned with strings of pearls with tall anthers
and pollen of all kings of jewels; with the inconceivable adornment of the
rain from clouds of precious crowns adorned with all precious jewels and
clouds of endless light rays; [F.352.a] with the inconceivable adornment of
the rain from clouds of the bodies of devas adorned by flowers, garlands,
parasols, banners, and streamers; and with the inconceivable adornment of
the rain and thunder from clouds of the bodies of multitudes of apsarases
scattering golden flowers from between their hands conjoined in homage
and praising all the qualities and excellences of the tathāgatas.

9. 12
Vast clouds and mists of the best incense stationed
 in the sky, together

Sāgara dhvaja for an entire day and night. [F.362.a] He sat before the bhikṣu
Sāgara dhvaja for two days, for seven days, for half a month, for a whole
month, for two months, for six months, and for another six days and nights.

When six months and six days had passed, the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja arose
from his samādhi. Then Sudhana said to him, “Ārya, this wonderful samādhi
that is so profound; that is so vast; that has such an immeasurable scope; that
has such an inconceivable manifestation; that has such an unequaled
radiance; that has such innumerable displays; that has such an inviolable
range; that has such an unalloyed scope; that has such a universal
illumination; that has such an accomplishment of benefit for limitless beings;

that brings such a cessation of the measureless sufferings of all beings; that
is present in order to end the sufferings of poverty; that is present in order to
save beings from existences of rebirth as animals, in order to close all the
gateways that lead to unfortunate existences, in order to lead onto the path
to higher existences, in order to bring the joy and happiness of devas and
humans, in order to bring the experience of joy within the scope of
meditation, in order to increase joy in composite conduct, and in order to
show the gateway to escape from the three realms that is present in order to
illuminate the causes for the creation of the aspiration to enlightenment, to
increase the causes for generating the accumulations of merit and wisdom,
[F.362.b] to increase the vast power of great compassion, to develop the
strength of great prayers, to attain the illumination of the path of the
bodhisattvas, to establish the yāna of the perfections, to accomplish entry
into the exceptional Mahāyāna, to know and illuminate the completely good
conduct, to know and attain the illumination of the bodhisattva bhūmi, to
accomplish the prayers, conduct, and pure-emergence displays of all the
bodhisattvas; and that becomes present in order to ascend without
impediment to the level of omniscience —Ārya, what is the name of this
samādhi?”
9. 46
The bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja answered, “Noble one, it is the perfection of
wisdom called the complete vision of the attainment of equanimity. The radiance of
that samādhi is called the pure display of every gateway.
9. 47
“Noble one, if you meditate on the pure display of every gateway samādhi that
arises from attaining the radiance of the perfection of wisdom called the
complete vision of the attainment of equanimity, then you will accomplish ten
times countless hundreds of thousands of samādhis such as the pure display of
every gateway.”
9. 48
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, what is the range of this samādhi?”
The bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja answered, “Noble one, if you rest in this
samādhi, you will have no impediment in perceiving world realms; you will
have no impediment in entering those world realms; you will have no
impediment in overpowering those world realms; you will have no
impediment in adorning those world realms; you will have no impediment in
cleansing those world realms; [F.363.a] you will have no impediment in
purifying those world realms; you will have no impediment in perceiving
and looking at the buddhas; you will have no impediment in examining the
greatness of the buddhas; you will have no impediment in knowing the
miracles of the buddhas; you will have no impediment in comprehending
and understanding the strengths of the buddhas; you will have no
impediment in comprehending the ocean of the qualities of the buddhas;
you will have no impediment in obtaining the rain of the Dharma clouds of

the buddhas; you will have no impediment in knowing and understanding
distinctly the Dharma wheels of the buddhas; you will have no impediment
in comprehending and understanding the ocean of the circles of followers of
the buddhas; you will have no impediment in comprehending and following
the ten directions; you will have no impediment in examining the Dharma
taught by the buddhas; you will have no impediment in examining the
directions of the buddhas; you will have no impediment in never
abandoning the direction of great compassion; you will have no impediment
in filling the directions with great love; you will have no impediment in
never tiring of the direction of gazing at the buddhas; you will have no
impediment in comprehending and understanding all of the ocean of the
buddhas; you will have no impediment in knowing and understanding all of
the ocean of beings; you will have no impediment in knowing and
understanding all of the ocean of the faculties of beings; and you will have
no impediment in knowing all the different faculties of beings.
9. 49
“Noble one, I know only this conduct of the perfection of wisdom. How
could I know or describe the qualities of, teach the conduct of, describe the
scope of, praise the strength of the great prayers of, illuminate the gateway
for the emergence of, describe the true accomplishment of, teach the path of,
follow the continuum of samādhi of, know the scope of the mind of, or be
able to comprehend the equanimity of the wisdom of the entry by the
bodhisattvas in the ocean of the conduct of the perfection of wisdom? So too
of the pure understanding of the scope of the realm of phenomena, [F.363.b]
of having the wisdom that follows knowing all phenomena, of pervading the
immeasurable field of perception with a vast understanding, of having the
power of the radiance of great mental retention, of the purity of the radiance
of the field of samādhi, of the emergence of the mighty power of miraculous
clairvoyance, of entering an ocean of unceasing discernment, of the sweet
voice of the essence of the bodhisattva bhūmi, or of becoming a refuge for all
beings.
9. 50
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a land called
Samudravetāḍī, in which there is a park named Samanta vyūha to the east of
the city Mahāprabhasa. There dwells an upāsikā by the name of Āśā, who is
the wife of Suprabhasa, a lord over humans. Go to her and ask her, ‘How
should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
9. 51
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was overjoyed, pleased, happy,
and content, having received the essence from the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja,
having been nourished by the Dharma, having been brought into the field of
samādhi, having attained the illumination of the light of wisdom, [F.364.a]
having attained the illumination of the radiance of samādhi, having realized

a pure aspiration, his mind
 having followed the radiance of the way of the
Dharma, possessing the radiance from the pure gateways, and having the
wisdom that has arisen from the light of all directions.

9. 52
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja, circumambulated the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja a hundred
thousand times, keeping him to his right, bowed down and paid homage to
the bhikṣu Sāgara dhvaja, and, looking back again and again, paying homage
to him, bowing down to him, venerating him,
 respecting him,
 keeping
him in mind, thinking of him, meditating on him, meditating deeply on him,
speaking highly of him, calling out in wonderment over him, focusing on his
qualities, praising him,
 being his follower, remembering him,
 relying on
him, never forsaking him, mentally approaching him and being connected
with him, being unified in prayer, longing to see him, remembering the
qualities of his voice, preserving the memory of him, keeping his name in his
mind, remembering his color and his form, contemplating the scope of his
wisdom, comprehending the range of his samādhi, joining him in the scope
of his prayers, practicing the range of his conduct, and receiving the
radiance of his wisdom, he departed from the presence of the bhikṣu Sāgara-

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, delighted by the qualities of the
kalyāṇamitra, [F.364.b] sent forth by the kalyāṇamitra, empowered by the
sight of the kalyāṇamitra, practicing the instructions of the kalyāṇamitra,
remembering the words of the kalyāṇamitra,
 and contemplating the
kalyāṇamitra with affection, saw kalyāṇamitras as the source of the
Buddhadharma, saw kalyāṇamitras as the teachers of the Buddhadharma,
saw kalyāṇamitras as masters
 in the Dharma of omniscience, and saw the
kalyāṇamitras as eyes that look into the sky of buddhahood.

Eventually he came to the Samanta vyūha Park in Samudravetāḍī. He saw
the Samanta vyūha Park, which was encircled by precious walls and rows
of precious trees that were perfectly adorned and by rows
 of beautiful,
delicate flowers, made of all precious materials, that released clouds of
pollen that were spread across the ground.
 It was adorned by trees made
of all precious materials. It was filled with a variety of blossoming flowers of
precious trees. The beautiful aroma from rows
 of various incense trees
spread in every direction. Strings of all kinds of jewels were hanging from
the various trees like a rainfall of strings of jewels showering down. The
trees made of all the kings of jewels were bestrewed, bedecked, and
beautified by a variety of precious jewels. All the wish-fulfilling flower trees
were beautified and covered by being draped with clothing of various colors.
When all the musical trees were moved by the breeze there came the
beautiful sound of music from instruments superior to those of the devas.
The ground was perfectly level, and upon it was the display of all the
various kinds of adorned trees [F.365.a] that were hung and beautified with
various kinds of ornaments.

All around there were a million ponds with yellow sandalwood mud,

10. 5
In the center of Samanta vyūha Park there was a great aerial palace
[F.365.b] called Vicitra dhvaja. It had a floor made of jewels from within the
ocean; it was adorned by beryl
 jewel pillars, with a high spire of Jambu
River gold and with floorboards that were a display of precious jewels that
illuminated the world; and it was draped in countless nets of shining

jewels that spread everywhere, and the kings of stain-eliminating jewels that
establish the propensities for sharp faculties.

In this celestial mansion called Vicitra dhvaja, countless, innumerable

The celestial mansion Vicitra dhvaja had many pinnacles made of

A million great canopies covered the Samanta vyūha Park from above.
There were canopies of cloth, canopies of creepers, canopies of flowers,

10. 12
The upāsikā Āśā was seated there on a great throne of the essence of gold,
wearing a crown of a net of pearls, the essences of the sea; wearing on her
arms gold armlets and bracelets transcending those of the devas; her arms
adorned by precious jewels shining with glorious light rays; wearing
precious, stainless, dark blue pendant earrings; her head beautifully adorned

by a net of precious jewels; wearing precious lion-face jewels on the upper
part of her ears; wearing a necklace of precious king of wish-fulfilling jewels
at her throat; her body covered in a brightly shining net of all jewels.
10. 13
A quintillion beings were bowing down to her in homage. In front of this
upāsikā, there came from the eastern direction [F.367.a] countless,
innumerable beings: Mahābrahmās, court priests of Brahmās, and
Brahmakāyika 
devas, 
Vaśavartins 
and 
Para nirmita vaśa vartin

10. 15
All those who suffered from various illnesses, were mired in various
kleśas, were attached to various wrong views, or were obscured by karmic
obscurations, as soon as they saw Upāsikā Āśā, [F.367.b] were healed of their
illnesses, became freed from the kleśas that stained their minds,
 departed
from their erroneous views, had all their mountains of obscurations
destroyed, and entered the pure field of freedom from obscurations, and
within that pure field they purified all their roots of merit, caused all the
seedlings of their faculties to grow, became dedicated to the ocean of the
way of omniscient wisdom, entered the entire ocean of the gateways to the
power of retention, faced the entire ocean of the gateways of samādhis,
developed all the gateways of prayer, gave rise to all the gateways of
conduct, purified all the gateways of the accomplishment of qualities, gave
rise to the ways of all the clairvoyances of a vast mind, and could go
anywhere with unimpeded bodies.
544
10. 16
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, entered the Samanta vyūha Park,
looked around at everything, and saw the upāsikā Āśā seated on a
magnificent throne. He approached the upāsikā Āśā and, having reached
her, bowed his head to the feet of the upāsikā Āśā. He circumambulated her,
keeping her to his right, many hundreds of thousands of times and then
said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it. [F.368.a] Āryā,


---

I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray
that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct
and how they should practice it!”
10. 17
The upāsikā Āśā said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the banner of bliss without sorrow. Noble one, through its power
it is beneficial to see me, it is beneficial to hear me, it is beneficial to honor
me, it is beneficial to be in one place with me, and it is beneficial to remember
me.
10. 18
“Noble one, when beings who have not developed the roots of merit, have
not become pupils of a kalyāṇamitra, and have no intention to attain
complete buddhahood look at me, I do not appear within their field of vision.
10. 19
“Noble one, merely through seeing me, beings become irreversible on the
path to the highest, complete enlightenment.
10. 20
“Moreover, noble one, tathāgatas come from the east into my presence,
and they sit on precious thrones and teach the Dharma. And just as they
come from the east, they come in that way from the ten directions.
10. 21
“Therefore, noble one, I am never without the sight of the tathāgatas, I am
never without the teaching of the Dharma, and I am never without the
company of bodhisattvas.
10. 22
“Noble one, eighty-four hundred thousand quintillion beings who have
the same level of conduct as me are present in this Samanta vyūha Park. They
are all irreversibly progressing to the highest, complete enlightenment.
[F.368.b]
10. 23
“Noble one, all the other beings who are present here will also progress
irreversibly to the highest, complete enlightenment and will be included
within the irreversible saṅgha and have the same level of conduct as
myself.”
10. 24
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, how long have you had the aspiration to attain the
highest, complete enlightenment?”
The upāsikā Āśā answered, “Noble one, I remember my past lives. There
was the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named Dīpaṅkara. I took the
vows of celibacy in the presence of that tathāgata. I made offerings to that
tathāgata. I obtained the teaching of the Dharma from that tathāgata. Before
him there was a tathāgata named Vimala. I entered homelessness within his
teaching, and I also obtained his wheel of the Dharma. Before him there was
a tathāgata named Ketu, and I propitiated him. Before him there was a
tathāgata named Meruśrī. Before him there was a tathāgata named Padma-
garbha. Before him there was a tathāgata named Vairocana. Before him there
was a tathāgata named Samanta cakṣu. Before him there was a tathāgata
named Brahmaśuddha. Before him there was a tathāgata named Vajranābhi.
Before him there was a tathāgata named Varuṇadeva.

10. 25
“Noble one, in that way I think of and remember the continuous sequence
of one life after another, one kalpa after another, and the successions of one
buddha after another, [F.369.a] remembering tathāgatas as numerous as the
grains of sand in thirty-six Ganges Rivers, whom I served, propitiated, made
offerings to, honored, and heard the Dharma from and within whose
teaching I practiced the conduct of celibacy.
10. 26
“Noble one, the tathāgatas know how many tathāgatas beyond that I have
honored.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because they fill the realm
of phenomena through developing the aspiration for enlightenment for the
first time.
10. 27
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through great
compassion they enter into all worlds.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through great
prayers they are based upon every level in the ten directions of the realm of
phenomena.
10. 28
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through their
great love they are spread among all beings.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through their
bodhisattva conduct they include all kalpas in all realms.
10. 29
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of samādhi they are irreversible on the bodhisattva path.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of retention they realize the way of retention that supports all beings.
10. 30
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of the radiance of knowledge they realize and possess the way of the
knowledge of the three times. [F.369.b]
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of clairvoyance they accomplish wheels of nets of light in accordance
with the thoughts and aspirations of beings in all realms.
10. 31
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
power of discernment they can satisfy all beings by uttering just one word.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas are immeasurable because through the
purity of their bodies they pervade all the buddha realms with their bodies.”
10. 32
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, at which twilight will you attain the highest,
complete enlightenment of buddhahood?”
Āśā answered, “Noble one, it is like this: bodhisattvas do not develop the
aspiration for enlightenment with the intention of guiding and ripening
one
 being, or a hundred
 beings, or a thousand
 beings, or a hundred
thousand
 beings, or ten million
 beings, or a thousand million beings,

“Go to him and ask him. [F.375.b] Noble one, he will teach you the

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
upāsikā Āśā and circumambulated the upāsikā Āśā, keeping her to his right,
a hundred thousand times. Looking back again and again, bowing, his face
covered with tears, thinking of the rarity of the highest enlightenment,
thinking of the rarity of being able to honor a kalyāṇamitra, thinking of the
rarity of meeting a superior being, thinking of the rarity
 of attaining the
faculties of a bodhisattva, thinking of the rarity of attaining the pure
motivation of a bodhisattva, thinking of the rarity of meeting suitable

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, thinking of following the
bodhisattva instructions, thinking of following the pure conduct of
bodhisattvas, thinking of increasing the strength of the merit of
bodhisattvas, thinking of the illumination of the power of seeing the
buddhas, thinking of developing the power to attain the treasure of the
Dharma, [F.376.a] thinking of increasing the power of accomplishing the
great prayers, thinking of facing every direction in the realm of the Dharma,
thinking of the illumination of the nature of the Dharma, thinking of the
dispersal of all obscurations, thinking of looking at the realm of Dharma free
of darkness, thinking of the motivation
 that is stainless and unbreakable
like Nārāyaṇa’s
 precious vajra, and thinking of invincibility and
unassailability in the face of all the māra armies, eventually arrived in the
land of Nālayu.

11. 2
He searched and searched for the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa. At that time,
the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa was dwelling in an ashram in a delightful forest
of countless different kinds of trees and creepers. In that forest there was a
canopy of the leaves of various trees, there were always flowers blossoming
on trees of various kinds, and there were fruit trees always laden with fruit.
Platforms of precious fruit had formed at the feet of trees that were made of
the 
various 
kinds 
of 
precious 
materials. 
There 
were 
beautifully
proportioned
 tall sandalwood trees. The forest was made pleasant by the
aroma that constantly came from beautiful agarwood trees. It was beautified
by scents in all four directions. It was adorned by perfectly proportioned
bignonia trees.
 There were beautifully formed banyan trees. Ripened fruits
were constantly falling from jambul trees. It was beautified by fresh red
lotuses, blue lotuses, and night lotuses.

Sudhana saw the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa and circumambulated the ṛṣi
Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa a hundred thousand times, keeping him to his right.

11. 4
The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa was seated under a canopy of interlaced
sandalwood branches. [F.376.b] His hair was bound into a topknot of matted
locks, he wore clothing made of skins and grass, with a skirt of bark, and he
was seated on a cushion of grass.
Sudhana approached the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa.
11. 5
When he had approached him, seeing that omniscience arises from the
gateway of the kalyāṇamitra, the genuine kalyāṇamitra that one wishes to
find, because the kalyāṇamitra teaches the true path; seeing that
omniscience is dependent on the instructions of the kalyāṇamitra because
they lead one to the level of omniscience; seeing that omniscience is
dependent on the friendship of the kalyāṇamitra because they lead one to
the island of the jewels of the wisdom of the ten strengths; seeing that
omniscience is the illumination from the lamp of the kalyāṇamitra because
they create the light of the wisdom of the ten strengths; seeing that the
kalyāṇamitra is the road to omniscience because they lead one to the city of
unimpaired omniscience, seeing that omniscience is the lamp of the
kalyāṇamitra because they reveal that which is equal and unequal; seeing
that the kalyāṇamitra is the bridge
 of omniscience because they eliminate
all the fear of falling into crevasses; seeing that the kalyāṇamitra is the
parasol of omniscience because they cool through the power of great
benevolence; seeing that the kalyāṇamitra is the power of omniscience
because they create great compassion; and seeing that reliance on the
kalyāṇamitra is the clear vision of omniscience because they illuminate the
way of the nature of phenomena, [F.377.a] Sudhana threw his body onto the
ground before him, prostrating to him. He then rose, circumambulated the ṛṣi
Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to
his right, and then sat down before him. With his hands together in homage
in a pleasing way with pleasing words, he said, “Ārya, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment. How does a bodhisattva
train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva practice it?
708
11. 6
“Ārya, I have heard that you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas.
Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct
and in what way they practice it!”
11. 7
The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa looked at the ten thousand brahmin
youths who were there and said, “Young men, this noble one has developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment. He has invited all
beings to become free of fear. This noble one is prepared to bring happiness
and benefit to all beings. He is facing an ocean of wisdom. He longs to drink
the rain of the clouds of Dharma of all the tathāgatas. He longs to enter the
ocean of all the ways of the Dharma. He longs to be in the great light of
709

wisdom. He longs for the great rain of the Dharma to fall. He longs for the
moon of great wisdom to rise over the world and extinguish all the torment
of the kleśas. He longs to increase the roots of merit of all beings.”
11. 8
Then the ten thousand brahmin youths scattered beautiful flowers with
lovely aromas and in various colors over Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
[F.377.b] strewed them over him, covered him with them, paid homage to
him, bowed down to him, circumambulated him, keeping him to their right,
and then said these words to him: “This one will become a protector of all
beings; he will end all the sufferings in the hells, he will block all the
pathways to rebirth as animals, he will turn beings away from the path that
leads to the world of Yama, he will close the doors to the unfortunate
existences, he will dry up the ocean of existences, he will cut through the
bondage of existences, he will repel the mass of suffering, he will dispel the
darkness of ignorance, he will establish a Cakravāla mountain range of merit
around the world, he will reveal the source of the jewels of wisdom, he will
cause the sun of wisdom to rise, he will purify the eyes of Dharma, and he
will reveal that which is equal and unequal in all the worlds.”
11. 9
Then the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa said to those youths, “Young men,
when someone has developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment and practices bodhisattva conduct, they create happiness for
all beings and will eventually attain omniscience. Young men, this noble one
has developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, and
therefore he will bring to completeness all the qualities of buddhahood.
[F.378.a]
11. 10
Then the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the banner of
being invincible to others.”
11. 11
Sudhana asked, “What is the scope of this bodhisattva liberation called the
banner of being invincible to others?”
The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa extended his right hand and with it stroked
and held the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
11. 12
As soon as the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa held the head of Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, with his right hand, Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, saw in the ten directions buddha realms as numerous as the atoms in a
million buddha realms; he perceived himself to be sitting at the feet of
buddhas as numerous as the atoms in a million buddha realms; he saw the
countless pure displays of forms within those buddha realms; he saw the
ocean of the multicolored display of the circles of followers of those
tathāgatas; he saw in the midst of those oceans of the circles of followers the
bodies of the tathāgatas, which were adorned with the shining signs and
features of a great being; he listened to their Dharma teachings without

missing a single word or term; he obtained those Dharma wheels of the
tathāgatas, each distinct from the other; he received the rain of Dharma that
fell according to the various aspirations of beings; and he comprehended an
ocean of the past prayers of those tathāgatas, which were purified by the
power of various aspirations; [F.378.b] he also comprehended those pure
oceans of various prayers, which were oceans that had been accumulated by
the buddhas; he also saw the perception of the colors of the bodies of the
buddhas that satisfied beings in accordance with their wishes; he also saw
the network of light rays from the buddhas as various passionless, pure
displays of halos; and he also perceived the strengths of those buddhas that
possessed the unobscured radiance of wisdom.
11. 13
In that way, he was illuminated by the light of wisdom from the
bodhisattva liberation called the banner of being invincible to others; he attained
the illumination of the samādhi called the essence of the sun; he possessed the
samādhi called the liberation of unceasing wisdom; he obtained the sight of the
gateway of retention called the network in all directions; he attained the
samādhi called the range of the summit of well-ordered knowledge;
 he had the
range of dwelling in the perfection of wisdom, which is the path
 with the
complete array of foundations; he gained the light of the samādhi called the
buddhas’ domain of the essence of space; his mind was illuminated by the samādhi
called the rim of the Dharma wheel of all the buddhas; and he attained the light of
the samādhi called the domain of the unceasing precious knowledge of the three
times.

He perceived sitting at the feet of some tathāgatas for one day and night,

feet of some for one month, at the feet of some for one year, at the feet of
some for a hundred years, at the feet of some for a thousand years, at the feet

many kalpas as there are atoms in Jambudvīpa, and so on up to at the feet of
some tathāgatas for as many kalpas as there are atoms in an

Then the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa released Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, and Sudhana perceived again that he was sitting at the feet of the ṛṣi
Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa.
11. 16
The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa asked him, “Noble one, do you remember?”
Sudhana replied, “Ārya, I remember the blessing of the kalyāṇamitra.”

The ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa said, “Noble one, I know only this
bodhisattva liberation called the banner of being invincible to others. How could I
know or describe the qualities, indicate the different prayers, know the
formation of realms, comprehend the scope of the wisdom, follow the range
of the samādhis, comprehend the miracles and emanations that follow the
arising of the might and display of the powerful liberations, grasp the
characteristics of the different bodies, describe the pure domain of the
voices, or teach the radiance of the wisdom of the bodhisattvas who have
attained the samādhis that have the clairvoyant knowledge that is superior
to all beings, who have power over the wheel of time,
 who are skilled in
the accomplishment of the knowledge of the signs of buddhahood,
 who
perceive the display of the rising of the sun of the tathāgatas, [F.379.b] who
have accumulated the knowledge of the single characteristic of the range of
the three times,
 who have bodies that are distributed through all world
realms, who have bodies
 of wisdom that illuminate the entire realm of
phenomena, who appear in accordance with the wishes of all beings, who
practice an appropriate conduct in a way that is in accordance with the
aspirations of beings, who shine in a way that delights, and who have the
pure domain of stainless radiant wisdom?

“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land called Īṣāṇa, there
dwells a brahmin by the name of Jayoṣmāyatana. Go to him and ask him,
‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
11. 19
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was overjoyed, pleased, happy,
and content. He bowed his head to the feet of the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa,
circumambulated the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa, keeping him to his right,
many hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking back again and again,
departed from the ṛṣi Bhīṣmottara nirghoṣa. [F.380.a] [B32]

Chapter 12
JAYOṢMĀYATANA
12. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was illuminated by the wisdom of the
bodhisattva liberation called the banner of being invincible to others. He dwelled
in the direct experience of the inconceivable range of the miraculous
manifestations of the buddhas. He perceived the direct knowledge of
inconceivable bodhisattva liberations. His mind was illuminated by the
wisdom of inconceivable bodhisattva samādhis. He had attained the
radiance of the wisdom of samādhi that is present at all times. He was
illuminated by the range of samādhi, in which all perceptions are present
and included. He had obtained the light of the wisdom that transcends all
worlds. He had the direct perception of dwelling in the entire range of the
three times.
 He was devoted to the wisdom that teaches equality without
dualistic conceptions. He had the light of wisdom that pervaded
throughout all objects of perception. He had mastered the treasury of
aspiration for pure patience toward all that is heard.
 He had attained the
definitive wisdom
 of patience for natural phenomena. His mind was never
apart from meditation on the nature of the bodhisattva conduct
 of higher
cognition. His mind was irreversibly progressing toward the power of
omniscience. He had attained the illumination of the knowledge
 of the ten
strengths. His mind was never content in its aspiration to hear the sound of
the words of the realm of Dharma. [F.380.b] His mind had gained entry into
the field of dwelling in omniscience. His mind had attained the infinite
display of bodhisattva conduct. His mind was purified
 by the infinite
domain of great
 bodhisattva prayers. He had the mind with direct
perception of the limitless knowledge without limit or center of the
unceasing network
 of world realms. He had the mind that never wearies
in ripening and guiding the infinite ocean of beings. He saw the infinite
range of bodhisattva conduct. He saw the infinite diversity of the different
world realms. He saw the small and the vast objects of perception included

within the infinite world realms. He saw the various networks of names that
are the bases for infinite world realms. He saw the various infinite, differing
relative designations and terms for infinite world realms. He saw the infinite,
differing aspirations of beings. He saw the infinite, differing categories of
beings. He saw the infinite practices for guiding and ripening beings. He
saw the various infinite perceptions
 of the directions and times of beings.
[F.381.a]
727
12. 2
Focused on the kalyāṇamitra, Sudhana eventually arrived in the land
called Īṣāṇa and went to where the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana was.
12. 3
At that time, the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana was practicing the basis for
accomplishing omniscience and practicing extreme asceticism. On all four
sides of himself he had lit fires the size of mountains. Towering above was
the precipice of a great mountain with a path of razors leading up it.728
12. 4
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana, sat down before him, and with his hands together
in homage said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment. How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva
conduct? In what way does a bodhisattva practice it? Ārya, I have heard that
you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas. Therefore, Ārya, teach me
how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
practice it!”
12. 5
The brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana said, “Noble one, go and climb up this
mountain on the path of razors and then jump down into this fire. In that
way, your bodhisattva conduct will become pure.”
12. 6
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, thought, “It is rare to avoid the eight
unfavorable existences. It is rare to become a human.
 It is rare to have pure
good fortune. It is rare to have the appearance of a buddha. [F.381.b] It is rare
to have unimpaired senses. It is rare to hear the Buddhadharma. It is rare to
meet a higher being. It is rare to have the friendship of a true kalyāṇamitra. It
is rare to gain the teaching of the true way. It is rare to have a right
livelihood. It is rare in the human world to practice the Dharma and the
ancillary Dharmas.
729
12. 7
“This person who will create an obstacle to my roots of merit, who urges
me to kill myself, is he a māra? Is he blessed by a māra? Is he a follower of
Māra? Is he pretending to be a kalyāṇamitra? Is he someone who destroys
bodhisattvas? Does he wish to prevent me from attaining omniscience? Does
he wish to lead me down a wrong path? Is he creating an obstacle to the
gateway of the Dharma through which one realizes the Buddhadharma?”
730
12. 8
When Sudhana had these thoughts, ten thousand Brahmās who were up
in the sky said to him, “Noble one, do not be unrelenting in these thoughts!
This ārya has attained the illumination of the samādhi vajra light rays. He has


---

unwavering diligence. He has set out on the greatest undertaking. He is
dedicated to drying up the moisture of craving in all beings. He is dedicated
to cutting through the nets of wrong views. He is prepared to incinerate the
forest
 of kleśas.
 [F.382.a] He is dedicated to illuminating all the desolate
areas of unfavorable knowledge.
 He has the resolute commitment to turn
all beings away from the terror of the chasm
 of aging and death. He is
dedicated to dispelling the darkness in the three times. He radiates the light
rays of the entire Dharma.
731
732
733
734
12. 9
“Noble one, while this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five
heats,
 through the power of his commitment to asceticism
 and self-
discipline, Brahmās who were accomplished and powerful, who arrogantly
thought of themselves as preeminent in all worlds, and who were attached
to a variety of incorrect views ceased to take pleasure in their state and no
longer enjoyed the taste of their dhyāna, and they came into the presence of
this ārya. When they had arrived, through the overpowering might
 of this
ārya’s miracles and his fierce discipline and asceticism, they were all turned
away from their wrong views, and he taught them the Dharma so that they
would abandon all their pride and arrogance. He taught them the Dharma so
that they would have great love and great compassion that spread over all
beings, so that they would have an unwavering wish for enlightenment, so
that they would develop a vast aspiration for enlightenment, so that they
would be dedicated to seeing all the buddhas, so that they would have the
complete attainment of the domain of the speech of the buddhas, and so that
there would be everywhere without obscuration or impediment the sound of
the voices of the buddhas.” [F.382.b]
735
736
737
12. 10
Ten thousand māras were also in the sky above, scattering divine precious
jewels. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya was enduring the ascetic
practice of the five heats, from this mass of light rays came a great radiance
that outshone all our residences, bodies, adornments, and possessions.
Therefore, we too ceased to take pleasure in our residences, and with our
entourages we came into the presence of this ārya. When we had come
before him, this ārya taught us the Dharma so that our minds were healed,
we developed the aspiration for enlightenment, and we became irreversible
on the way to the highest, complete enlightenment.”
12. 11
Ten thousand Vaśavartin deva kings were also in the sky above,
scattering divine flowers. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya was
enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we also ceased to take delight
in our residences, and therefore each of us, without entourages, came into
the presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us the
Dharma so that we gained control over our own minds. He taught us the
Dharma so that we would have power over all kleśas, so that we would have


---

the power to be reborn wherever we wish, so that we would have the power
to purify the obscuration of karma, so that we would have power over all
meditative states, so that we would have power over requisites, [F.383.a] and
so that we would have the power to live as long as we wish.”
12. 12
Ten thousand Sunirmita deva kings were also in the sky above, singing
out a melodious roar of divine songs. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya
was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats there came from those
masses of flames a corresponding light that purified, illuminated, and
brightened our aerial palaces. It also illuminated and brightened our
adornments and our apsarases. Then we ceased to take delight in our
entourage of young devas and apsarases. We ceased to delight in the bliss of
desire, and our bodies and minds were left unsatisfied. We came into the
presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us the
Dharma so that our minds would be purified. He taught us the Dharma so
that our minds would be brightened, so that our minds would be very
pure,
 so that our minds would be tractable, so that our minds would be
joyful, so that we would have the pure attainment of the knowledge of the
ten strengths, so as to increase the great power of the Dharma, so as to purify
our bodies, so as to attain an immeasurable buddha body, so as to purify our
speech, and so as to attain the voice of a buddha.”
738
12. 13
Ten thousand Saṃtuṣita deva kings were also in the sky with
 an
entourage of deva youths and apsarases, [F.383.b] all of whom were paying
homage and making an offering of sending down rain from clouds of
various scented powders. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya was
enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we ceased to take delight in
our residences. As we had ceased to take delight in them, we came into the
presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us the
Dharma so that we would not be dependent on any sensory object. He
taught us the Dharma so that our minds would have contentment, so that we
would create the roots of merit, so that we would attain the development of
the aspiration for enlightenment, and so that we would be able to fulfill the
entire Buddhadharma.”
739
12. 14
Ten thousand Suyāma deva kings were also in the sky with an entourage
of deva youths and apsarases, all of whom were sending down a rain of
divine coral tree flowers. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya was
enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we ceased to take delight in
listening to divine songs. As we had ceased to take delight in them, we came
into the presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us
the Dharma so that we would turn away from all delight in desires and so
that we would attain all of the Buddhadharma.”


---

12. 15
Ten thousand Śakras, lords of devas, each with their thirty-two secondary
lords and an entourage of deva youths and apsarases, were also in the sky.
They were dropping down rain from clouds of divine clothing, precious
adornments, and flowers. They said, “Noble one, [F.384.a] when this ārya
was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we ceased to take delight
in Śakra’s palace, park, pleasure groves, the playing of divine music,
attendants, and songs. As we had ceased to take delight in them, we came
into the presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us
the Dharma so that we would renounce all delight in desires. He said, ‘All
these have the qualities of being impermanent, unstable, and decaying.’ He
taught us the Dharma so that our arrogance and carelessness would end and
we would develop the aspiration for the highest enlightenment.
12. 16
“Moreover, noble one, just by his gaze these peaks of Meru are shaken.
We became alarmed on being shaken, and as the omniscient mind cannot be
disturbed, we made the prayer to attain omniscient wisdom.”
12. 17
Ten thousand nāgas such as the nāga kings Airāvata, Nanda, and
Upananda were also in the sky above. They were sending down rain from
clouds of divine yellow sandalwood, the pleasant sound of a chorus of nāga
maidens, and rain that was a flow of divine scented water. They said, “Noble
one, when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, from
this great fire shone a great light that illuminated all the dwellings of nāgas
and eliminated the rains of sand and fear of the garuḍas. [F.384.b] It also
pacified anger, refreshed our bodies,
 and made our minds serene.
 Then
when we had serene minds, this ārya taught us the Dharma so that we
would repudiate the evil ways of nāgas, renounce all karma that brings
obscuration, confess transgressions, develop the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, and be established in omniscience.”
740
741
12. 18
Ten thousand yakṣa lords were also in the sky above. They made various
kinds of offerings to the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana and Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, and then they said, “Noble one, when this ārya was
enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we and all our retinues
developed a loving mind toward humans. All yakṣas, rākṣasas, and
kumbhāṇḍas also developed loving minds. They came before us with loving
minds and without violence. We too were overpowered by the power of love,
and each of us ceased to delight in our own residences. In that way, we each
went with our retinues to the presence of the ārya. When we arrived, a light
came from this ārya’s body, illuminated all our bodies, and filled us with
bliss. In that way, both our bodies and minds became blissful. Then he
taught us the Dharma so that the multitude of yakṣas, rākṣasas,
kumbhāṇḍas, 
and 
kaṭapūtanas 
would 
develop 
the 
aspiration 
to
enlightenment.”


---

12. 19
Ten thousand gandharva lords [F.385.a] were also in the sky above, and
they said, “Noble one, while we were each dwelling in our own abodes, and
when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, from this
fire came a light that illuminated our abodes. When that light struck us we
experienced inconceivable bliss. We went to be in the presence of this ārya,
and when we arrived in his presence, he taught us the Dharma so that we
would progress irreversibly toward the highest, complete enlightenment.”
12. 20
Ten thousand asura lords rose up from the ocean, high into the sky, where
they knelt on their right knees, and with hands together in homage they
paid homage, saying, “Noble one, when this ārya was enduring the ascetic
practice of the five heats, our asura world, a great circle of earth with its
oceans and mountains, shook. All our arrogance and pride was
overwhelmed by his self-discipline and asceticism. We went to be in the
presence of this ārya, and when we arrived in his presence, he taught us the
Dharma so that we would abandon all deception, enter the patience of the
profound Dharma, be established in the unshakable true nature of
phenomena, and attain the knowledge of the ten strengths.”
12. 21
Ten thousand garuḍa lords [F.385.b] such as the garuḍa lord
Mahāvegadhārin manifested in the form of handsome brahmin
 youths
and said, “Noble one, when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of
the five heats, a great light came from these great masses of fire and
illuminated and shook our abodes. We were frightened, terrified, and
dismayed, and so we went to be in the presence of this ārya. This ārya taught
us the Dharma so that we would practice great love, so that we were
established in great compassion, so that we would apply ourselves to
plunging into the ocean of saṃsāra, so that we would apply ourselves to
saving beings who are sinking in the swamp of desire, so that we would
apply ourselves to the pure gateway of the higher motivation for
enlightenment,
 so that we would apply ourselves to sharp
 wisdom and
methods, and so that we would apply ourselves to guiding beings in
whatever way will ripen them.”
742
743
744
12. 22
Ten thousand kinnara lords were also in the sky. They said, “Noble one,
when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, the sound
of the word Buddha, the word Dharma, the words irreversible bodhisattva Saṅgha,
and the words the prayer to reach enlightenment came from the rows of palm
trees, the music of the garlands of strings of networks of little bells on our
trees,
 the musical instruments, the precious jewelry, the enjoyed
possessions in the homes, and the blowing of the breezes
 in our domain.
There came the words that said that in this and that particular world a
bodhisattva named such and such is praying to attain enlightenment;
[F.386.a] in this and that particular world a bodhisattva named such and such
745
746


---

is accomplishing a difficult renunciation; in this and that particular world a
bodhisattva named such and such is purifying the domain of omniscient
wisdom; in this and that particular world a bodhisattva named such and
such is going to the bodhimaṇḍa; in this and that particular world a
bodhisattva named such and such has defeated Māra, and his army is
attaining the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood; in this and
that particular world a tathāgata named such and such is turning the wheel
of the Dharma; in this and that particular world a tathāgata named such and
such, having accomplished all the deeds of a buddha without remainder, is
passing away into the state of nirvāṇa without any remaining skandhas.
12. 23
“Noble one, it is possible that there could be an end to the number of
atoms from all the plants, wood, branches, leaves, and petals in Jambudvīpa,
but there is no end to the number of the names of tathāgatas, of the
bodhisattva prayers, and of the different engagements in bodhisattva
conduct that come from, resound from, and are heard from the rows of palm
trees and so on up to
 the musical instruments, the precious jewelry, the
enjoyed possessions in the homes, [F.386.b] and the blowing of the breezes
in our domain.
747
12. 24
“In that way, we experienced bliss through the intense joy of hearing the
sound of a river
 of the words Buddha, Dharma,
 and Saṅgha, the prayers
and conduct engaged in by bodhisattvas, and their names.
748
749
12. 25
“We each went to be in the presence of the ārya. When we arrived in his
presence, this ārya taught us the Dharma so that we would become
irreversible in our progress to the highest, complete enlightenment.”
12. 26
Countless thousands of desire-realm devas with beautiful bodies
 were
also in the sky, making offerings with mentally emanated offerings. They
said, “Noble one, when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five
heats, a light came from these great masses of fire. That light illuminated
beings as far down as the Avīci hell and extinguished the sufferings of all
the beings in the hells. That light brought the image of this ārya to our eyes,
and therefore we yearned for this ārya and experienced the bliss of the realm
of desire devas.
 In that way, we were grateful to him, never ceased
wanting to see him, and renounced delighting in desires. We went to be in
the presence of this ārya. This ārya taught us the Dharma so that we would
pray for the enlightenment of limitless beings.” [F.387.a]
750
751
12. 27
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, on hearing this way of the
Dharma, was overjoyed, pleased, happy, and content. He recognized the
brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana to be a true kalyāṇamitra. He bowed his head to the
feet of the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana and said, “Ārya, I confess my
transgression of having disobeyed a kalyāṇamitra’s instruction.”


---

12. 28
Then the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana recited this verse to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son:
12. 29
“The bodhisattva who successfully follows the instructions
And who is mindful not to disobey the guru’s words752
Will successfully accomplish all goals and successfully
Attain the wisdom of buddhahood, enlightened under the Bodhi tree.”
12. 30
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, climbed the path of razors up the
mountain precipice and jumped down into the great mass of fire. When he
jumped, he attained the bodhisattva samādhi called completely stable. When he
landed in the fire, he attained the bodhisattva samādhi called perceiving the
bliss of peace.
12. 31
Sudhana said, “I am astonished, Ārya! The touch of the fire was blissful,
and the mountain path of razors was also blissful to the touch.”
12. 32
The brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana said, “Noble one, I have attained the
bodhisattva liberation called the unceasing domain. [F.387.b] However, noble
one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the unceasing domain. How
could I know or describe the qualities of the bodhisattvas who are like
masses of fire, who pray to eliminate all the kleśas and wrong views of all
beings, who have an ensign
 that is never in retreat, who have invincible
minds, who have minds that never despair, who have minds that are never
despondent, who are like Nārāyaṇa possessing the vajra essence, who reach
the conclusion of their great undertakings, who have no despondency, who
never slacken, who are like whirlwinds, who are dedicated to the benefit of
all beings, who have irreversible diligence, and who wear the armor of
irreversibility?
753
12. 33
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a city called Siṃha-
vijṛmbhita. There dwells Maitrayaṇī, the daughter of King Siṃhaketu, with
her entourage of five hundred maidens. Go to her and ask her, ‘How does a
bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva practice
it?’ ”
12. 34
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana, circumambulated the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana,
keeping him to his right, many hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking
back again and again, departed from the presence of the brahmin
Jayoṣmāyatana.

MAITRAYAṆĪ
13. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, with inconceivable respect
 for
kalyāṇamitras, with a pure, vast
 aspiration, intent on the Mahāyāna,
aspiring 
to 
the 
wisdom 
of 
buddhahood, 
[F.388.a] 
following 
the
Buddhadharma, longing to follow the kalyāṇamitras, practicing veneration
of the Dharma,
 intent on unimpeded wisdom, with conviction in the
highest goal, being within the range of the apogee of wisdom,
comprehending the three times in a fraction of an instant, intent on the
nondual apogee of space, having attained certainty in the apogee of
nonduality, dwelling in the nonconceptual apogee of the realm of the
Dharma, having entered the comprehension of the way that is the apogee of
being free of obscurations, dedicated to the harmony that is the apogee of
action,
 realizing that the apogee of the tathāgatas is without an apogee,
dwelling in the nonconceptuality that is the apogee of the buddhas,
 and
dedicated to the wisdom that disperses the network of conceptualizations of
all beings, had a mind free from all attachment to realms, free from
attachment to all the circles of followers of the buddhas, and practiced,
without dwelling in any location, the purification of all buddha realms; he
had the recognition that there is no self and no beings within all beings,
comprehended that all sounds are like echoes,
 and was dedicated to the
realization that all forms are the same as reflections of forms.

13. 2
Sudhana eventually arrived at the city of Siṃha vijṛmbhita. He searched for
and sought the maiden Maitrayaṇī and heard that Maitrayaṇī, the daughter
of King Siṃhaketu, with her entourage of five hundred maidens, was in a
palace called Vairocana garbha. [F.388.b] She was teaching the Dharma while
seated on a throne that had uragasāra sandalwood legs, was draped in a
network of threads of gold, and had a cushion made of divine material.


---

13. 3
Sudhana entered the city of Siṃha vijṛmbhita and went to the residence of
King Siṃhaketu. He sat at the king’s outer gate hoping to see the maiden
Maitrayaṇī.
13. 4
Sudhana saw many hundreds of people, many thousands of people, many
hundreds of thousands of people there.
13. 5
He asked them, “Where have you come from? Where are you going?”
They replied, “We have come to hear the Dharma from the maiden
Maitrayaṇī.”
Sudhana thought, “It seems as if everyone is allowed to go in,” and he
went inside.
13. 6
When he had gone inside and looked around, he saw that the Vairocana-
garbha palace had the inconceivable display of a floor that was made of
crystal, pillars made of beryl, and walls made of diamonds; it was adorned
with hundreds of thousands of pinnacles made of solid gold, was furnished
with round mirrors made of the essence of a thousand precious materials,
and was adorned with countless precious jewels; it was arrayed with
precious jewels that delighted beings and was strewn with countless nets of
jewels;
 and there was the melodious sound from hundreds of thousands
of jingling golden bells.
760
13. 7
He saw the maiden Maitrayaṇī, who had deep black eyes,
 deep black
hair, and golden skin.
761
13. 8
Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of the maiden Maitrayaṇī,
circumambulated her, keeping her to his right, many hundreds of thousands
of times, [F.389.a] and with his hands together in homage sat down before
her.
13. 9
Sudhana said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
13. 10
“Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
13. 11
Maitrayaṇī said, “Noble one, look at the display of my residence!”
Sudhana looked all around and saw in each wall, each pillar, each round
mirror, each form, each shape, each precious jewel, each golden bell, each
precious tree, each pore, and each string of jewels the images of the
tathāgatas in all the realm of phenomena first developing their aspiration for
enlightenment, their conduct and the scope of their prayers, the display of
their setting forth, their manifestation of the attainment of buddhahood, their
turning the wheel of the Dharma, and their demonstration of passing into
nirvāṇa. What he saw from one object of perception he saw from all the
objects of perception. For example, there appeared in a lake filled with water


---

that was unpolluted and clear [F.389.b] the reflection of the sky, the sun, the
moon, and the constellations of stars. In the same way, in every object of
perception within the Vairocana garbha palace appeared the reflections of all
the tathāgatas present in the entire realm of phenomena as the result of the
maiden Maitrayaṇī’s previous roots of merit.
13. 12
When Sudhana had seen and remembered the features of this display of
the vision of the buddhas, with his hands together in homage he looked at
Maitrayaṇī’s face.
13. 13
She said to him, “Noble one, I have attained the teaching
 of the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the complete display. I sought this teaching
of the gateway to the perfection of wisdom called the complete display from as
many tathāgatas as there are grains of sand in three hundred and sixty
million Ganges Rivers. Those tathāgatas, through making me enter various
gateways, made me realize the teaching of the gateway to the perfection of
wisdom called the complete display. What was taught by any one of them was
not taught by another of them.”
762
13. 14
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is the scope of this teaching of the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the complete display?”
Maitrayaṇī answered, “Noble one, having been made to face, reflect on,
follow, practice, contemplate, approach,
 grasp, display, attain, adorn, and
analyze this teaching of the gateway to the perfection of wisdom called the
complete display, [F.390.a] there arose the power of retention called the complete
gateways. Countless millions of Dharma gateways are present, are included,
are manifest, are collected, and are arranged
 within the range of that
power of retention.

“However, noble one, I know only this teaching of the gateway to the

“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a land called
Trinayana. There dwells a bhikṣu by the name of Sudarśana. Go to him and
ask him, ‘How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a

13. 18
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
maiden Maitrayaṇī, circumambulated the maiden Maitrayaṇī, keeping her to
his right, many hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking back again and

SUDARŚANA
14. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplated the profound conduct of
wisdom of the bodhisattvas, contemplated reaching the profound basis of
the realm of phenomena, contemplated all
 profound subtle wisdom,
contemplated 
the 
profound 
aspect 
of 
worldly 
conceptualization,
contemplated the profound ground
 that is without creation, contemplated
the profound ground of the stream of the mind, contemplated the profound
ground of dependent origination, contemplated the profound true
 ground
of nature, contemplated the profound true ground of the terminology
 of
beings, contemplated the profound ground of the adorning array of the
realm of phenomena, contemplated the profound ground of dependence on
the processes of the body, and contemplated the profound ground of the
various transformations of the body.

776
14. 2
Eventually he arrived at the land of Trinayana. He searched for the bhikṣu
Sudarśana throughout the land, throughout the towns, throughout the cities,
throughout the marketplaces, throughout the villages, [F.392.b] throughout
the cattle pens, throughout the ashrams of ṛṣis, throughout the regions and
districts, throughout the banks of rivers, throughout mountain caves, and
throughout great forests until he saw the bhikṣu Sudarśana inside a thick
forest.
14. 3
The bhikṣu Sudarśana was a young adult, handsome, good looking, and
attractive. His deep black hair curled to the right. His head was like a
parasol. There was an uṣṇīṣa on the crown of his head. His forehead was
broad. His eyes were wide and deep black. His eyelashes were like the
eyelashes of a cow. His nose was lovely, high, and prominent.
 His lips
were the beautiful color of vermilion and perfectly proportioned. His teeth
were even, without gaps, very white, and a full forty in number. He had jaws
like a lion. His cheeks were full and wide. His eyebrows were long, beautiful,
and curved like a bow. He had the mark of the ūrṇā hair the color of the
777

moon. His earlobes were long and hung loosely. His face was bright and
beautiful like the full moon. His throat was round and as beautiful as a
conch. His heart area was adorned by the śrīvatsa. His upper body was like
the upper body of a lion. His flesh between the shoulder blades was
muscular. His shoulders were bulky and rounded. His arms were long. His
fingers were webbed. His hands and feet were adorned by wheels. His
hands and feet were soft, young, and thick. He had the seven prominences.
His waist was slim like a vajra’s. His body was big and straight. His thighs
were round. His penis was retracted into his body. His calves were like the
calves of a female blackbuck. His fingers were long. The heels of his feet
were wide. He had a halo a fathom in width. He was golden in color. Each of
his body hairs was curled upward to the right. [F.393.a] He had the circular
symmetry
 of a king banyan tree. He was adorned with the signs and
features of a superior being. His eyes did not blink or waver. He remained in
a state of mindfulness. He was like the Himalayas, the king of mountains,
adorned with various grasses, forests, herbs, and vines. His intellect was
vast. He had an invincible range and scope of wisdom. The display of the
field of his voice was like thunder from the clouds. His mind was free of all
vacillation, conceit, instability, or frivolity. He had an unalloyed range of
wisdom. He had attained the illumination of the vast range of the wisdom
of buddhahood. He was continuously motivated to ripen and guide all
beings. He had developed the vast
 field of great compassion.
778
779
780
14. 4
He was dedicated to possessing the way of the Dharma of all the
tathāgatas. He was dedicated to bringing the light of wisdom to all beings.
He was mindful of the way of the tathāgatas. He was on the meditation
walkway. He was walking neither too fast nor too slow, serenely and
steadily.
 He was dressed like the Śuddhāvāsa devas.
781
14. 5
He was encircled by devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, Śakra, Brahmā, the world guardians, humans, and
nonhumans.
14. 6
When Sudarśana was going to change the direction in which he was
walking, the devas of the directions turned
 the field of directions around.
The devas of walking received his footsteps on precious lotuses. The devas
who cause fire, who have unceasing disks of light, dispelled obscuring
darkness. The devas of the forest of Jambudhvaja [F.393.b] sent down a rain
of many flowers. The devas of the earth, who have the essence of stability,
revealed many sources of jewels. The devas of the sky, who have the
splendor of complete brightness, adorned the surface of the sky. The devas
of the ocean, who are the source of splendor, scattered great precious jewels.
The devas of Sumeru, who have the essence of stainlessness, placed their
hands together and paid homage. The devas of the air, who have unimpeded
782


---

power, spread breezes that scattered perfume, incense, and flowers. The
devas of the night,
 with their bodies bedecked in jewelry, bowed down in
homage. The devas of the daytime, who have the disk that always causes
beings to wake were holding banners of precious jewels that illuminated the
directions and standing in the sky in order to create light.
783
14. 7
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the bhikṣu Sudarśana and
bowed his head onto the surface of the bhikṣu Sudarśana’s feet, covered the
surface of the bhikṣu Sudarśana’s feet with kisses,
 and wiped
 them
well.
784
785
14. 8
Then Sudhana sat down before the bhikṣu Sudarśana and with his hands
placed together said, “Ārya, I am set on the highest, complete enlightenment
and am seeking bodhisattva conduct.
14. 9
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
14. 10
The bhikṣu Sudarśana said, “Noble one, having reached adulthood, I am
newly entered into the homeless life. [F.394.a]
14. 11
“Noble one, I have in this one lifetime practiced celibacy before as many
tathāgatas as there are grains of sand
 in thirty-eight Ganges Rivers. I
practiced celibacy with some for a day and night. I practiced celibacy with
some for seven days. I practiced celibacy with some for half a month. I
practiced celibacy with some for a month. I practiced celibacy with some for a
year. I practiced celibacy with some for a hundred years. I practiced celibacy
with some for a thousand years. I practiced celibacy with some for a hundred
thousand years. I practiced celibacy with some for ten million years. I
practiced celibacy with some for a quintillion years. I practiced celibacy with
some for an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of years. I practiced celibacy with
some for an intermediate kalpa. I practiced celibacy with some for half a
kalpa. I practiced celibacy with some for a kalpa. I heard the Dharma from all
those tathāgatas and received their instructions and teachings.

“I have purified an array of prayers. I have purified the field of conduct
that enters the range of realization.787
“I have completed an ocean of the perfections. I have perceived the
miraculous manifestations of complete buddhahood. I have held their
wheels of Dharma each distinct from another.
14. 13
“I have realized the equality of their strengths. I have held their teachings
for as long as their Dharma remained.
“I have accomplished, through the power of the accomplishment of the
samādhi of the field of prayer, the previous prayers of all those tathāgatas for
the purification of my own buddha realm. [F.394.b]

14. 14
“I have accomplished, through the power of entering the samādhi of
entering all conducts, the past practice of bodhisattva conduct by all those
tathāgatas for the purification of my own conduct.
“I have accomplished, through the power of setting forth on completely
good conduct, the pure perfections of all those tathāgatas.
14. 15
“Moreover, noble one, because of the gateway of the perfectly observant
wisdom, while I am walking on this meditation walkway there come toward
me the gateways of the continuums of all directions.
14. 16
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, the gateways of the
continuums of all world realms are moving further away in order to purify
the transcendence of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of world realms
through the power of accomplishing great prayers.
14. 17
“In one instant of mind, through the power of accomplishing the
bodhisattva’s completely good conduct and prayers, I directly perceive an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of gateways of the ways of conduct among
beings in order to complete the wisdoms of the ten strengths.
14. 18
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of
accomplishing the prayers to make offerings to past and future buddhas, I
directly perceive the vision of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of buddha
realms
 in order to make offerings to, serve, and honor tathāgatas as
numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of buddha realms.

 follow countless ways of the Dharma.

“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayers to fulfill the bodhisattva conduct that are like
magical illusions,
 I directly perceive the ocean of the conduct of an

conduct.
791
14. 21
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayer to concentrate all the fields of samādhi
through a single samādhi, I directly perceive the ocean of an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of samādhis in order to purify all fields of
samādhi.
14. 22
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayer to attain the power of the highest
mindfulness, I directly perceive the ocean of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta
of powers in order to manifest all the wheels of the powers and the wheels of
time.

14. 23
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayer for the end of endless beings, I directly
perceive an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of wheels of time in order to turn
the wheels of Dharma in all times.
14. 24
“Through the arising of a single aspiration, through the power of the
accomplishment of the prayer for the light of the wisdom of realization, I
directly perceive an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of oceans of all three

14. 25
“However, noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the
never-extinguished lamp of wisdom.
 How could I know or describe the
qualities of the bodhisattvas whose aspiration is like a vajra; who have been
born into the family that is the family of all the tathāgatas; who have the
power of unceasing life; who have a lamp of wisdom that is never
extinguished; who have indestructible, unbreakable bodies; who have
accomplished a physical form that is like an illusion; who have bodies that
have the limbs and smaller physical parts that accord with being phenomena
dependent on causes; who have bodies that are perceived in accordance
with the wishes of beings; who demonstrate forms, bodies, colors, shapes,
and circumferences that are like those of all beings; who have bodies that are
unharmed by burning embers, flames, poison, or weapons; whose bodies are
as hard as vajras and as invincible
 as the Cakravāla mountain range; who
make the power of all māras and adversaries ineffective; who resemble a
mountain of Jambu River gold; who have bodies that are superior to those of
all beings; who are perceived as a refuge
 by all beings; who are perceived
and heard from all sides; who are looked up to with admiration by
 all
beings; who are the source of the clouds of all the Dharma; who illuminate
every direction; who appear beautiful as a result of destroying the
mountains of obscurations; who appear as supreme heroes because they
defeat all the roots of demerit; who are a joy to see because they originate

‘How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a

14. 27
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was dedicated to the pure prowess
and practice of the bodhisattvas. His mind was illuminated by the light of the
power of the bodhisattvas. In his heart he had mastered the unconquerable
fortitude of the bodhisattvas. His mind was indefatigable because of the
excellent armor of the resolution of the bodhisattvas. He was dedicated to

the stability and vastness of the resolute aspiration of the bodhisattvas. He
had the aspiration to possess all the rain from the clouds of bodhisattva
conduct. He had the continuity of never having enough of the rain from the
clouds of Dharma of the bodhisattvas. He had the aspiration directed toward
realizing all the qualities of the bodhisattvas. He longed to send himself to
be the embodiment of the charioteers for all beings. He longed to lead beings
out beyond the great forest of saṃsāra. He never had enough of gazing
upon, listening to, and honoring kalyāṇamitras. He had developed an
immeasurable veneration for the Dharma.

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the

He eventually, with an entourage of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and

15. 3
He searched for the boy Indriyeśvara until the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and
gandharvas in the sky above called down, “Noble one, [F.2.a] the boy
Indriyeśvara, accompanied by ten thousand other children, is playing in the
sand at the conflux of the rivers.”
15. 4
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went into the city of Sumukha
toward the confluence of the rivers. When he arrived there, he saw the boy
Indriyeśvara accompanied by ten thousand children, playing in the sand.
15. 5
When he saw the boy Indriyeśvara, he approached him, bowed his head
to the boy Indriyeśvara’s feet, circumambulated the boy Indriyeśvara many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and then sat down
before the boy Indriyeśvara. He placed the palms of his hands together and
said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment. How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? In
what way does a bodhisattva practice it?”

“Ārya, I have heard that you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas.

Indriyeśvara said, “Noble one, Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has taught me

In front of Indriyeśvara there was a heap of sand that was many yojanas
high. [F.4.b] He counted how many grains of sand there were in that heap,
beginning with “the number of grains of sand in this mound” and
continuing until he said, “there are an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya parivarta of grains
of sand in this heap.” Having taught Sudhana through the teaching that
stipulated the number of grains of sand in that heap of sand, he said, “Noble
one, this method of counting of the bodhisattvas continues from one world
realm to another. With this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, one can
calculate the number of the entire extent of world realms in the eastern
direction. In the same way, with this method of counting of the bodhisattvas,
one can calculate the number of the entire extent of world realms in the

southern direction, in the western direction, in the northern direction, in the
northeastern direction, in the southeastern direction, in the southwestern
direction, in the northwestern direction, in the upward direction, and in the
downward direction.
15. 12
“Noble one, with this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, the entire
extent of the succession of the names of world realms in the ten directions
are taught; with this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, the entire
extent of the succession of the names of world realms in the ten directions is
counted.
15. 13
“Just as the entire extent of the succession of world realms in the ten
directions is taught, in the same way the succession of names of kalpas in
the ten directions is taught, the succession of the names of buddhas is
taught, the succession of the names of Dharmas is taught, the succession of
the names of beings is taught, and the succession of the names of actions is
taught, so that all these are comprehended.
15. 14
“With this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, the entirety of however
many successions of names that can be taught and that are in the ten
directions is comprehended in full. [F.5.a]

“With this method of counting of the bodhisattvas, the entirety of however

“However, noble one, in that way I know only this light of bodhisattva
wisdom that is the possession of the clairvoyance of crafts that is the
knowledge of all phenomena. How could I know the conduct of the
bodhisattvas who engage with the number of all beings, who engage with
the number of all the accumulations of Dharmas, who engage with the
number of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and who have power over the
wheel of the names of all the Dharmas? How could I describe their qualities?
How could I reveal
 the range of their activity? How could I elucidate the
scope of their knowledge? How could I praise their strengths? How could I
proclaim their resolute intentions? How could I cast light
 on their
accumulations? How could I explain their prayers? How could I teach their
conduct? How could I speak of their pure perfections? How could I make
clear their pure attainments? How could I describe the range
 of their
samādhis? How could I comprehend the light of their wisdom?

“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called Samudra-
pratiṣṭhāna, where dwells an upāsikā by the name of Prabhūtā. Go to her
and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How
should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”

When Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, heard the words of the
kalyāṇamitra, the hairs on his body rose, he felt a powerful great happiness,
and he had great joy in his mind. He had obtained this rare, wonderful jewel
of motivation. He had developed the motivation of intending to benefit many
beings. He had the power to encounter the successive appearances of the
buddhas. [F.5.b] He was dedicated to understanding the pure field of the
Dharma. He was dedicated to demonstrating setting forth to liberation in
different ways appropriate to all places.
 He knew the distinct ranges of
activity of the buddhas in the levels of the three times. He had a state of
mind that had arisen from an inexhaustible ocean of merit. He had the power
of the illumination of great wisdom. He had broken open the gate that sealed
beings within the city
 of the three realms.

Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of the boy Indriyeśvara,
circumambulated the boy Indriyeśvara many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from the boy Indriyeśvara.

PRABHŪTĀ
16. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had obtained the rain from the cloud of
the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras.
16. 2
He was like the ocean that never has too much rain from the clouds. The
light from the sun of the wisdom of the kalyāṇamitras had caused the
seedling of his powers to sprout from the ground of his ripened good karma.
16. 3
The net of light rays from the full moon of the instructions of the
kalyāṇamitras had brought ease to his mind and body.
16. 4
Like the herds of deer who wish to drink the clear, cooling water from the
Himalayas when they are tormented by the heat of the summer
 sun, he
longed to drink the water of the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras.
952
16. 5
The white lotuses of his mind had blossomed through the instructions of
the kalyāṇamitras to become a lotus pond like a pond with a bed of
blossomed lotuses over which hovers a swarm of bees.
16. 6
The jewels of the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras, like the island of
jewels that is completely filled with all kinds of jewels, continuously
illuminated the mind.
16. 7
Like the great accumulation of flowers and fruit on the great Jambu tree,
the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras have a perfect accumulation of merit
and wisdom.
16. 8
Like the great clouds in the sky born from the sublime play of the great
lords of serpents,
 [F.6.a] the accumulation of instructions heard from the
kalyāṇamitras expanded.
 The towering mass of the various stainless
Dharmas of the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras was like the variegated
summit of the Trāyastriṃśa paradise.
 Just as Śakra and his entourage of
the host of Trāyastriṃśa devas defeat the hosts of the lord of the asuras, the
entourage of the host of the stainless qualities that arise from the
instructions of the kalyāṇamitras cannot be surpassed but overwhelm others.

Eventually he arrived at the town called Samudra pratiṣṭhāna. When he
was searching for the upāsikā Prabhūtā, a great crowd of people told him,
“Noble one, the upāsikā Prabhūtā is in her house in the middle of the city.”
16. 10
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went to the home of the upāsikā
Prabhūtā, and with his palms together in homage, he stood at the door.
16. 11
He saw that the upāsikā Prabhūtā’s house was encircled by a large and
extensive precious wall. It had a gateway in each of the four directions and
was adorned with countless measureless jewels that had been created from
the ripening of merit.
16. 12
Sudhana entered the house, looked around, and saw the upāsikā Prabhūtā
seated on a precious throne. She was a very young maiden who had newly
become an adult, having just reached puberty. She was surpassingly
beautiful, attractive, and lovely to look at. Her skin was an excellent, perfect
color. Her hair hung loose. She wore no jewelry. She wore a white robe and
skirt.
16. 13
Every being who saw the upāsikā Prabhūtā, whether deva or human,
conceived of the upāsikā Prabhūtā as being their teacher. [F.6.b]
16. 14
Apart from buddhas and bodhisattvas, everyone else who came into that
house was overwhelmed by her body, the power of her mind, her majesty,
and her color.
16. 15
Also, a hundred trillion
 seats had been arranged in that house. They
were superior to any human or deva seat. They had been created through
the ripening of a bodhisattva’s karma.
956
16. 16
Sudhana did not see any store of food or drink in the house, nor did he see
any store of clothing, jewelry, or possessions apart from a single small pot
placed before her.
16. 17
Sudhana saw ten thousand maidens in front of her. They all had the skin
color of apsarases, the bodies of apsarases, the manner of apsarases, the
behavior of apsarases, the pleasures of apsarases, the courtesy of apsarases,
the divine
 clothing of apsarases, the jewelry of apsarases, and the
beautiful-sounding voices of apsarases, and their waists
 were like those of
apsarases.
957
958
16. 18
Her entourage of maidens was stationed before her, fulfilling all her
instructions, gazing upon her, honoring her, venerating her, showing her
respect, facing her, listening to her, looking upon her, gazing upon her,
bowing down to her, making obeisance to her, and paying homage to her.
16. 19
The perfume that emanated from their bodies filled the entire surrounding
town with its pleasant aroma, and when beings smelled that aroma, they all
ceased to have malice in their minds, ceased to have animosity in their
minds, ceased to have aggression in their minds, ceased to have jealousy
and greed in their minds, ceased to have deception and deceit in their minds,


---

ceased to have craving and anger in their minds, ceased to go back and forth
between low and high spirits, and had loving minds, altruistic minds, self-
controlled minds, and minds that did not wish to acquire the possessions of
others.
16. 20
All those who heard the voices of those maidens [F.7.a] became delighted,
reverent, and subdued.959
16. 21
Having seen this, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to
the feet of the upāsikā Prabhūtā, circumambulated her many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and sat before her. With his
palms together in homage, Sudhana said, “Āryā, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
should practice it. Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings
to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train
in bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
16. 22
The upāsikā Prabhūtā said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the unceasing display of the treasure of merit.
16. 23
“Noble one, from this small pot, beings
 with different wishes are
satisfied by whatever foods they enjoy, with various kinds of broths, various
flavors, various colors, and various aromas.
960
16. 24
“Noble one, in that way, with this one small pot I can satisfy a hundred
beings with the foods they enjoy. I can satisfy with the foods they enjoy a
hundred thousand beings, ten million beings, a billion beings, a trillion
beings, a quintillion beings, and an innumerably-beyond-an-innumerable
number of beings with different wishes. I strengthen them, make them
joyful, [F.7.b] please them, delight them, make them content, and make them
happy. Nevertheless, this small pot is never diminished, depleted, emptied,
used up, exhausted, spent, or finished, nor does it ever come to an end.
16. 25
“Noble one, in the same way, I can satisfy, make joyful, please, delight,
make content, and make happy, with whatever foods they enjoy and with
various kinds of broths, various flavors, various colors, and various aromas,
beings with different wishes who are as numerous as the atoms in a world
realm of four continents, as numerous as the atoms in a world realm of a
thousand four-continent worlds, as numerous as the atoms in a world realm
of a million four-continent worlds, as numerous as the atoms in a world
realm of a billion four-continent worlds, and as numerous as the atoms in
innumerably more numerous than innumerable buddha realms.
16. 26
“Nevertheless, this small pot is never diminished, depleted, emptied, used
up, exhausted, spent, or finished, nor does it ever come to an end.


---

16. 27
“Noble one, if the beings in all world realms in the ten directions, all with
different wishes and aspirations, were all to come here, they would all be
satisfied and so on up to made happy by the food they enjoy. Just as it would
be with various kinds of food, they would all be satisfied and so on up to
made happy by various kinds of drinks, by various kinds of flavors, by
various kinds of seats, by various kinds of beds, by various kinds of steeds,
by various kinds of clothing, by various kinds of flowers, [F.8.a] by various
kinds of garlands, by various kinds of perfume, by various kinds of incense,
by various kinds of ointments, by various kinds of powders, by various kinds
of jewels, by various kinds of jewelry, by various kinds of precious carriages,
by various kinds of parasols, by various kinds of banners, by various kinds
of flags, and by various kinds from among the entire range of utensils.
16. 28
“Moreover, noble one, all the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas in a single
world realm in the east, who are in their final life, attain the result of the
śrāvaka and pratyeka buddha enlightenments by eating my food. Just as it is
in one realm in the east, so it is in a hundred world realms, a thousand world
realms, a hundred thousand world realms, ten million world realms, a billion
world realms, ten billion world realms, a hundred billion world realms, a
quintillion world realms, and world realms as numerous as the atoms in the
world realm of Jambudvīpa, as the atoms in a world realm of four continents,
as the atoms in a world realm of a thousand four-continent worlds, as the
atoms in a world realm of a million four-continent worlds, and as the atoms
in a world realm of a billion four-continent worlds.
16. 29
“In the same way, all the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas in world realms
as numerous as the atoms in innumerably more numerous than innumerable
buddha realms in the east, who are in their final life, will attain the result of

“Just as it is for those who are in the east, so it is for all of those who are in
the south, in the west, in the north, [F.8.b] in the northeast, in the southeast,
in the southwest, in the northwest, below, and above.
16. 31
“Noble one, all those who are bodhisattvas in their last life in a single

defeat Māra and his armies, and attain the highest, complete enlightenment
of buddhahood.

food, be seated at the bodhimaṇḍa, defeat Māra and his armies, and attain

“Just as it is for those who are in the east, in the same way all those who
are bodhisattvas in their last life in one world realm in the south, in the west,
in the north, in the northeast, in the southeast, [F.9.a] in the southwest, in the

961
16. 35
“Noble one, do you see these ten thousand maidens?”
Sudhana replied, “Āryā, I see them.”
16. 36
The upāsikā Prabhūtā said, “Noble one, myself and these maidens [F.9.b]
and countless millions of others have the same conduct, the same prayer, the
same roots of merit, the same display of setting forth, the same pure path of
aspiration, the same pure mindfulness, the same pure mode of being,
 the
same measureless realization, the same attainment of the highest faculties,
the same pervasion of mind, the same range of the scope of conduct, the
same way of the Dharma, the same ascertainment of meaning, the same
teaching of the meaning of the Dharma, the same pure form, the same
measureless strengths, the same voicing of the words of the Dharma, the
same pure voice in all our communication,
 the same pure qualities in all
our conduct because we are praised for limitless qualities, the same purity of
karma because of having the pure ripening of faultless karma, the same all-

pervasive great love because of our protection of all beings, the same
pervasive great compassion because of our tireless ripening of all beings, the
same pure karma of body because we manifest the bodies that satisfy beings
according to their wishes, the same pure karma of speech in communicating
the meaning of the words in the realm of the Dharma, the same arrival into
the circles of the followers of all the buddhas, the same eagerness for all the
buddha realms in order to serve and make offerings to all the buddhas, the
same directly perceived knowledge in comprehending all the ways of the
Dharma, [F.10.a] and the same pure conduct in attaining all the bodhisattva
levels.
16. 37
“Noble one, these ten thousand maidens, within one single instant, travel
throughout the ten directions in order to offer food to the bodhisattvas in
their final life. They take food from this small pot and go throughout the ten
directions in order to offer it as alms to śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas in
their final life. They take food from this small pot and go throughout the ten
directions in order to satisfy all the hosts of pretas with the food.
16. 38
“Noble one, in that way I satisfy the devas with divine food from this small
pot, and I satisfy nāgas with nāga food, yakṣas with yakṣa food, gandharvas
with gandharva food, asuras with asura food, garuḍas with garuḍa food,
kinnaras with kinnara food, mahoragas with mahoraga food, humans with
human food, and nonhumans with nonhuman food.
“Noble one, stay a moment and you will see a sight.”
16. 39
As soon as the upāsikā Prabhūtā said those words, at that moment, having
been invited by the upāsikā Prabhūtā in the prayers she made in the past,
countless beings came in through the eastern door. In the same way,
countless beings, invited by the upāsikā Prabhūtā in the prayers she made in
the past, came in through the southern, the western, and the northern doors.
[F.10.b] Seated on her throne, the upāsikā Prabhūtā satisfied, made joyful,
pleased, delighted, made content, and made happy those beings who had
arrived with whatever foods they enjoyed, in various kinds of broths, with
various flavors, various colors, and various aromas.
16. 40
Just as with the food, she satisfied them and so on up to made them happy
with various kinds of drinks, various kinds of flavors, various kinds of seats,
various kinds of beds, various kinds of steeds, various kinds of clothing,
various kinds of flowers, various kinds of garlands, various kinds of
perfume, various kinds of incense, various kinds of ointments, various kinds
of powders, various kinds of jewels, various kinds of jewelry, various kinds
of precious carriages, various kinds of parasols, various kinds of banners,
various kinds of flags, and various kinds from among the entire range of
utensils.

16. 41
She satisfied and so on up to made happy devas with divine food, and she
and satisfied nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras,
mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans with their food.
Nevertheless, her small pot was never diminished, depleted, emptied,
used up, exhausted, spent, or finished, and it never came to an end.
16. 42
Then the upāsikā Prabhūtā said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “I
know only this bodhisattva liberation called the unceasing display of the treasure
of merit. How could I know or describe the qualities of the conduct of
bodhisattvas who have an inexhaustible ocean of merit, [F.11.a] who possess
inexhaustible merit, who have accumulated a vast accumulation of merit and
are therefore like space, who fulfill the prayers of all beings and are therefore
like the king of wish-fulfilling jewels, who protect the roots of merit of all
beings and are therefore like a Cakravāla mountain range of merit, who send
down a rain of jewels from their hands and are therefore like a great cloud of
merit, who open the gate to the city of the Dharma and are therefore like the
direct vision of a treasure of great merit, and who dispel the darkness of the
poverty of all beings and are therefore like a lamp of great merit?
16. 43
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called
Mahāsaṃbhava. There dwells a householder by the name of Vidvān. Go to
him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
16. 44
Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of the upāsikā Prabhūtā,
circumambulated the upāsikā Prabhūtā, keeping her to his right, many
hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking back again and again,
departed from the upāsikā Prabhūtā.

VIDVĀN
17. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had obtained the light of the liberation
called the unceasing display of the treasure of merit. He contemplated that ocean
of merit. He viewed that sky of merit. He obtained that heap of merit. He
climbed that mountain of merit. He accumulated that store
 of merit. He
immersed himself in that river of merit. [F.11.b] He descended the steps into
the bathing place of that merit. He purified that field of merit. He looked at
that treasure of merit. He thought of that way of merit. He paid attention
to that tradition
 of merit. He purified that lineage of merit.
964
965
966
17. 2
Eventually he arrived at the town called Mahāsaṃbhava and searched,
sought, and looked around
 for the householder Vidvān.
967
17. 3
He searched for the householder Vidvān while longing for kalyāṇamitras,
with his being transformed by seeing kalyāṇamitras, with an aspiration that
was the blessing of the kalyāṇamitras, with dedication to following
kalyāṇamitras, with diligence in tireless service of the kalyāṇamitras, with all
the roots of merit of relying on kalyāṇamitras, with all the accumulation of
merit through being faithful to the kalyāṇamitras, with the practice of the
skillful methods increased by the kalyāṇamitras, with skill in serving the
kalyāṇamitras without relying on anyone else, and while increasing all his
roots of merit, purifying the bodhisattva motivation, increasing the
bodhisattva faculties, ripening all roots of merit, increasing the fulfillment of
great prayers, making great compassion vast, seeing himself as coming close
to omniscience, receiving the Dharma radiance of the completely good
bodhisattva conduct from all the buddhas, and increasing the illumination of
the ten strengths of the tathāgatas.
968
17. 4
He saw the householder Vidvān at the crossroads in the center of the
town. He was upon a dais made of the seven precious materials. He was
seated upon an excellent throne made of countless jewels. [F.12.a] Its legs of
precious jewels were adorned with various diamonds and sapphires. It was


---

covered with a network of strings of gold. It contained stainless precious
jewels. Its form was decorated with five hundred jewels. Various cushions of
divine material were set upon it. Around it stood streamers, banners, and
flags made of divine cloth. It was covered by a net of strings of many jewels.
Overhead was a great bejeweled canopy, from which hung wreaths of
flowers of gold and jewels.
17. 5
A parasol of Jambu River gold was held aloft
 by its stainless handle
made of beryl. Vidvān was being fanned by precious stainless fans made of
the feathers of the king of geese,
 and censers of various incenses
perfumed the air around him.
969
970
17. 6
There was an entourage of five thousand musicians to the right and left
who played and beat on musical instruments, emitting a beautiful music that
transcended that of the devas and filled the town of Mahāsaṃbhava in order
to bring delight to beings. These ten thousand beings let fall a rain from
clouds of divine flowers. Their bodies surpassed those of devas and humans.
They had the complete bodhisattva motivation and were adorned with
jewelry that surpassed that of the devas.
17. 7
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the householder Vidvān
and, having come up to him, bowed his head to Vidvān’s feet,
circumambulated him, keeping him to his right, many hundreds of
thousands of times, and sat down before him. With his palms together in
homage, Sudhana said, “Ārya, I have set out to attain the highest, complete
enlightenment in order to end the suffering of all beings, [F.12.b] in order to
bring all beings to happiness, in order to save all beings from the ocean of
saṃsāra, in order to take all beings across to the island of the jewels of the
Dharma, in order to dry up the moisture of the cravings of all beings, in order
to create the moisture of compassion in all beings, in order to expel all
delight and craving of desire from all beings, in order to make all beings gain
a craving for the wisdom of buddhahood, in order to make all beings pass
through the jungle of saṃsāra, in order to make all beings develop a delight
and desire for the Dharma and the qualities of the buddhas, in order to make
all beings depart from the city of the three realms, and in order to lead all
beings to the city
 of omniscience.
971
17. 8
“However, I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and in what way they should practice it. Ārya, I have heard that you
give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me
how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and how having
trained in it they become supports for all beings!”
17. 9
The householder Vidvān said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
“Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration
for the highest, complete enlightenment!


---

17. 10
“Noble one, it is rare to find a being who develops the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment, who seeks the bodhisattva conduct,
[F.13.a] who never has enough of gazing upon a kalyāṇamitra, who never
tires of coming into the presence of a kalyāṇamitra, who never becomes
dispirited in serving a kalyāṇamitra, who never becomes unhappy with
seeking a kalyāṇamitra, who never turns back from seeking a kalyāṇamitra,
who never ceases to sincerely yearn for and be attracted to a kalyāṇamitra,
who never turns away from gazing upon a kalyāṇamitra, who is never
despondent in following the instructions of a kalyāṇamitra, and who never
wearies of serving and honoring a kalyāṇamitra.
17. 11
“Noble one, do you see those in my entourage?”
Sudhana replied, “Yes, Ārya, I see them.”
17. 12
Vidvān said, “Noble one, I made all of them develop the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment. I have caused them to be reborn in the
family of the tathāgatas. I have nourished them through the accumulation of
the perfections. I have made them practice all the good qualities. I have made
them develop the ten strengths of the tathāgatas. I have made them
transcend the family of the world. I have established them in the family of
the tathāgatas. I have made them turn away from the wheel of worldly
existences. I have made them enter into the turning of the wheel of the
Dharma. I have saved them from falling into lives in the three lower
existences. I have established them in the understanding of the true nature
of phenomena.
“Noble one, it is in that way that bodhisattvas become a refuge for all
beings.
17. 13
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called
 the merit
that arises from the treasury of mind. Through its power I give food to those who
wish for food; drink for those who wish for drink; [F.13.b] excellent flavors to
those who wish for excellent flavors; hard food to those who wish for hard
food; soft food to those who wish for soft food; food that is licked to those
who wish for food that is licked; food that is sucked to those who wish for

“Noble one, stay a moment and you will see a sight.”
17. 14
As soon as the householder Vidvān said those words, at that moment,
having been invited by the householder Vidvān in the prayers he had made
in the past, there came countless beings from different directions, from
different lands, from different districts, from different towns, from different
markets, from different cities, from different villages, from different hamlets,
from different houses, from different castes, from different families, from
different levels of families, from different ways of life, and from different
classifications of stations in life. These beings had various different sensory
perceptions, wishing for various kinds of food, desiring various kinds of
food, with various aspirations, desiring different aspirations and desires,
desiring pure food and drink, desiring meat, wishing to consume contrasting
kinds of different food, and remaining in various kinds of distinct sensory
perceptions and different ways of life. In other words, among humans there
were those who wished for such various kinds of food as boiled rice, sour
gruel, broths, fish, and meat.
17. 15
Whatever were the different kinds of food and drink that were wished for
by those with different ways of life among human beings, through the
power of the bodhisattva, the drumbeat of the unimpeded generosity of the
bodhisattva, and the invitation made by the past prayers of the bodhisattva,
all those human beings came there, and when they had arrived they
entreated the householder Vidvān. They looked upon him, observed him,
and addressed him.
17. 16
The householder Vidvān, knowing that the petitioners had all gathered
there, [F.14.b] thought for a moment and then looked up into the sky. From
the realm of the sky there came into the palms of his hands a great number of
various kinds of food and drink, with various kinds of flavors, various kinds
of colors, and various kinds of aromas. He gave these different kinds of food,


---

drink, and utensils to all the petitioners gathered there, who had different
aspirations and desires, in accordance with what they desired, so that they
were satiated, pleased, contented, delighted, joyful, and overwhelmed with
happiness.
17. 17
Having concluded satisfying them in that way, afterward he taught them
the Dharma. He taught the Dharma that elucidated the cause of gathering a
vast accumulation of wisdom, elucidated the cause that made it impossible
for poverty to occur, elucidated the cause of the arising of perfect great
enjoyment, elucidated the cause of the arising of the attainment of the
Dharma’s way of wisdom, elucidated the cause of the arising of gathering a
vast accumulation of merit, elucidated the cause of the arising of the
attainment of the enjoyment of the food of happiness, elucidated the cause of
the arising of the attainment of a body adorned by the signs and features of a
great being, elucidated the cause of the arising of the attainment of
invincible strength, elucidated the cause of the arising of the attainment of
the unsurpassable
 food of wisdom, and elucidated the cause of the arising
of the attainment of the inexhaustible strength of merit that defeats the
strength
 of all the māras.
976
977
17. 18
When all those who came wishing for food were satisfied through having
obtained various kinds of food from the realm of the sky, the householder
Vidvān taught them the Dharma so that they could attain perfect lifespans,
color, strength, happiness, and eloquence. [F.15.a]
17. 19
When all those who came wishing for drink were satisfied and delighted
through having obtained many kinds of delicious, nontransgressive drinks,
the householder Vidvān taught them the Dharma so that they would turn
away from thirsting for saṃsāra, from delighting in saṃsāra, and would
develop a delight in the Buddhadharma, a thirst
 for the Buddhadharma.
978
17. 20
After all those who came wishing for excellent flavors had been satisfied
by the different excellent flavors of sweetness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness,
bitterness, and astringency, the householder Vidvān taught them the
Dharma so that they would attain the supreme flavor of the physical signs of
a great being.
17. 21
When all those who had come from all directions wishing for carriages
had received the gifts of different kinds of carriages, the householder Vidvān
taught them the Dharma so that they would ride upon the Mahāyāna.
979
17. 22
When those wishing for clothes had come from all directions, the
householder Vidvān, knowing that they had all gathered there, thought for a
moment and then looked up into the sky. From the realm of the sky appeared
many kinds of pure clothes in various colors —blue, yellow, red, white,
madder, and transparent
 —that came into the palms of his hands. When
the householder Vidvān had distributed these to the petitioners, he taught
980


---

them the Dharma so that they would have the pure attainment of a
tathāgata’s unsurpassable sense of shame and conscience that is like the
color of gold.
In that way, the householder Vidvān demonstrated the inconceivable
scope of the bodhisattva liberation.
17. 23
Then he said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, [F.15.b] “I know only
the bodhisattva liberation called the merit that arises from the treasury of the mind.
How could I know the conduct, describe the qualities, or teach the
miraculous powers of the bodhisattvas who have attained the power over
requisites; who have attained jewel-producing hands; who can cover all
world realms without exception with their hands in order to accomplish
various offerings to the buddhas; who can send down rain from clouds of
jewels of various colors upon the circles of the followers of all the tathāgatas;
and similarly can send down rain from clouds of jewelry of various colors,
from clouds of crowns of various colors, from clouds of kūṭāgāras of various
colors, from clouds of clothing of various colors, from clouds of the various
melodious sounds of divine musical instruments being played and beaten
and beautiful songs, from clouds of flowers of various colors, from clouds of
perfumes of various colors, from clouds of incense, garlands, ointments,
powders, Dharma robes, parasols, banners, and flags of various colors, from
clouds of every kind of offering to all the buddhas, and from clouds of all
requisites that fall upon all the circles of followers of the tathāgatas and all
realms of beings in order to honor and make offerings to all the buddhas and
in order to ripen and guide all beings?
17. 24
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called
Siṃhapota, where dwells a head-merchant patron of the Dharma by the
name of Ratnacūḍa. Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train
in bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
17. 25
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was pleased, delighted, enraptured,
overjoyed, and filled with happiness.
 [F.16.a] He demonstrated to the
householder Vidvān the respect of a Dharma pupil. Sudhana viewed him as
someone through whose blessing one can receive all the Buddhadharma,
viewed him as someone through reliance on whom one can attain
omniscience; he demonstrated a continuous delight
 in the kalyāṇamitras;
he had the determination to obey every instruction of the kalyāṇamitras;
being under their power he followed the kalyāṇamitras; he longed to
listen
 to the teachings and words of the kalyāṇamitras; he kept in mind
the power of faith that came from the kalyāṇamitras; he sought the
instructions of the kalyāṇamitras; and he aspired to follow and please the
kalyāṇamitras.

17. 26
Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of the householder Vidvān,
circumambulated the householder Vidvān, keeping him to his right, many
hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking back again and again,
departed from the householder Vidvān.

RATNACŪḌA
18. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had conviction in that river of merit. He
viewed that field of merit. He purified that mountain
 of merit. He climbed
down that stairway to the bathing place of merit. He opened that treasury of
merit. He viewed that treasure of merit. He purified that domain of merit. He
carried away that heap of merit. He developed that strength of merit. He
increased that power of merit.
984
18. 2
Sudhana eventually arrived at the town of Siṃhapota. He searched for
Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant patron of the Dharma. He saw him in the
middle of a market.
 Sudhana bowed his head to Ratnacūḍa’s feet,
circumambulated Ratnacūḍa, keeping him to his right, many hundreds of
thousands of times, [F.16.b] and sat down before him. With his hands
together in homage, he said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas
should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
985
18. 3
“Ārya, will you not bestow on me the instruction for the bodhisattva path,
which is the path by which I will become omniscient?”
Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant patron of the Dharma, grasped the hands
of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, led him to his home and, showing
Sudhana his home, said, “Noble one, look at my home!”
18. 4
Sudhana looked at it. The house was made of pure, bright Jambu River
gold. It was vast and tall and encircled by a wall of silver. It was beautified
by arrangements of bright crystals. It was adorned by a hundred thousand
clusters of beryls. There was an array of pillars of white coral. A lion throne
made of red pearls had been erected. Lion banners made of asteria jewels
were displayed. Overhead there was a shining canopy of jewels. It was
draped in nets of gold adorned with wish-fulfilling jewels. There was an
array of countless varieties of precious jewels. It was furnished with ponds


---

made of emerald and filled with cool water. It was encircled by trees made of
precious materials. It was massive. It was vast. It had ten stories. It was very
tall. It had eight doors.
18. 5
Sudhana went inside and looked around.
On the first floor he saw food and drink being distributed.
On the second floor he saw clothing being given away. [F.17.a]
18. 6
On the third floor he saw jewelry and adornments being given away.
On the fourth floor he saw being given away the most precious, excellent
maidens on the great earth who are the pleasures enjoyed in harems.
18. 7
On the fifth floor he saw an assembly of bodhisattvas on the fifth bhūmi
who were dedicated to the pleasure of talking together
 about the Dharma,
whose thoughts were concerned with the benefit and happiness of the
world, who were accomplished in all treatises, who had the power of
retention, who had the seal
 of samādhi, who rose from samādhi, who
analyzed samādhi, and who had attained the light of wisdom.
986
987
18. 8
On the sixth floor he saw bodhisattvas who had attained the state of the
perfection of wisdom, who had profound wisdom, who had clairvoyantly
perceived the pacification of all phenomena, who came forth from all the
gateways that were the essences and gateways of the samādhis and
retentions,
 whose range of activity was free of obscuration, who practiced
nonduality, who manifested discussions of the Dharma, and who followed
the way of the perfection of wisdom, analyzed it, elucidated it, and discussed
the many gateways to the perfection of wisdom. These included the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the essence of peace, the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the categories of wisdom for all beings, the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the unwavering turning, the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the dust-free light, the gateway to the perfection of
wisdom called the essence
 of invincibility, the gateway to the perfection of
wisdom called the illumination of beings,
 [F.17.b] the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the field of the way that is followed, the gateway to
the perfection of wisdom called the essence of the ocean,
 the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the attainment of all-seeing equanimity, the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the possession of inexhaustible treasure, the
gateway to the perfection of wisdom called the ocean of the ways of the Dharma,
the gateway to the perfection of wisdom called following the ocean of beings, the
gateway to the perfection of wisdom called unimpeded eloquence, and the
gateway to the perfection of wisdom called resting in objectlessness after
focusing on the clouds of the Dharma. They discussed the perfection of wisdom
through countless millions of such gateways to the perfection of wisdom in a
countless array of separate gatherings of assemblies of bodhisattvas.

18. 9
On the seventh floor he saw an assembly of bodhisattvas who had all
attained the patience of perceiving everything as echoes, who had given rise
to infallible wisdom and method, and who had received the clouds of the
Dharma from all tathāgatas.
18. 10
On the eighth floor he saw an assembly of bodhisattvas who had all
attained clairvoyance that would never diminish, who moved within all
world realms, whose images appeared within all the gathered assemblies,
whose bodies were distributed throughout the entire realm of phenomena,
whose field of experience never departed from being at the feet of all the
tathāgatas, who encountered the bodies of all the buddhas, and who were
the first individuals to speak within the assemblies of the followers of all the
tathāgatas. [F.18.a]
18. 11
On the ninth floor he saw an assembly of bodhisattvas who were all in
their final lifetime.
18. 12
On the tenth floor he saw when all the tathāgatas first developed the
aspiration for enlightenment, their conduct, their setting forth, their oceans
of prayers, the range of their buddha miracles, their buddha realms, all their
circles of followers, their teaching the wheel of the Dharma, and their power
to guide beings.
18. 13
When he had seen this, he asked Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant patron of
the Dharma, “Ārya, how did you gain this pure good fortune? How did you
plant the roots of merit that have ripened in this way?”992
18. 14
Ratnacūḍa answered, “Noble one, I remember that in the past, more
kalpas ago than there are atoms in a buddha realm, there was a world realm
called Cakravicitra, and in that world appeared a tathāgata, an arhat, a
samyak saṃbuddha, one with wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who
knows the world’s beings, an unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a
teacher of devas and humans, a buddha, a bhagavat named Ananta raśmi-
dharma dhātu samalaṃkṛta dharma rāja. That tathāgata, together with a billion
śrāvakas, such as Jñānavairocana, and a trillion bodhisattvas, such as Jñāna-
sūrya tejas, having been invited by King Dharmeśvara rāja, went to the great
park called Maṇi dhvaja vyūha rāja.
993
994
18. 15
“When the Tathāgata had entered the town [F.18.b] and was passing
through the market, in order to make an offering to the Tathāgata and his
saṅgha of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas, I played music and burned a pellet of
incense to spread the aroma. By burning that pellet of incense, the entirety of
Jambudvīpa was covered for seven days with multicolored clouds
 of
perfume that took on the forms of all beings.
995
18. 16
“From those clouds of perfume came these words: ‘The tathāgatas have an
inconceivable accumulation of the stainless knowledge of the three times.
That omniscience is free of all obscuration. They have eliminated all the


---

propensities for kleśas. All that is offered to the tathāgatas will bring the
immeasurable great result of omniscience. It will unite you with
omniscience.’
18. 17
“Those words were emitted from those masses of clouds of incense
through the blessing of the Buddha in order to ripen my roots of merit and
increase the power of the roots of merit of countless
 beings.
996
18. 18
“Noble one, I dedicated the roots of merit from the manifestation of that
miracle to three objectives through the blessing of the Tathāgata. What are
those three? I made the dedication so that I would have the complete vision
of all kalyāṇamitras, of all buddhas, and of all bodhisattvas.
18. 19
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the unimpeded
display of the field of prayer. [F.19.a] How could I know the conduct or describe
the qualities of the bodhisattvas who are the source of limitless good
qualities, who have entered an unalloyed ocean of buddha bodies, who have
received the rain from unalloyed Dharma clouds, who have entered an ocean
of unalloyed qualities, who have extended the net of completely good
conduct, who have entered the range of unalloyed samādhis, who have the
unalloyed continuous roots of merit of all bodhisattvas, who have the
unalloyed nonconceptual conduct of all the tathāgatas, who have entered
the unalloyed equality of the three times, who have the unalloyed ability to
dwell tirelessly in all kalpas, and who reside on the level of an unalloyed
complete range of vision?
18. 20
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a land called
Vetramūlaka. There, in a town called Samanta mukha, dwells a perfume-seller
head merchant by the name of Samanta netra. Go to him and ask him, ‘How
should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
18. 21
Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant
patron of the Dharma, circumambulated Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant
patron of the Dharma, many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to
his right, and, looking back again and again, departed from Ratnacūḍa, the
head-merchant patron of the Dharma. [B2]

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had perceived the visions of infinite
buddhas. He had attained the companionship of infinite bodhisattvas.
[F.19.b] He had been illuminated by the infinite ways of the paths of the
bodhisattvas. His mind had certainty through being saturated by the infinite
ways of the Dharma of the bodhisattvas.
 He purified the path of the
infinite motivations of the bodhisattvas. He had attained the brilliance of the
infinite faculties of the bodhisattvas. He dwelled in the infinite aspirations of
the bodhisattvas. His mind followed the example of the infinite conduct of
the bodhisattvas. He possessed the banner of the infinite invincibility of the
bodhisattvas. He possessed the movement of the infinite light of wisdom of
the bodhisattvas. He had attained the infinite illumination of the Dharma of
the bodhisattvas.

Sudhana eventually arrived in the land of Vetramūlaka, and he searched
everywhere for the town of Samanta mukha, unwearyingly, fearlessly, and
with unflagging diligence and an inviolable determination. He searched in
the principal and intermediate directions, the districts and subdistricts, high
and low, up and down. He never forgot the instructions of the
kalyāṇamitras, always keeping the perfect conduct of the kalyāṇamitras in
his heart, possessing the faculties that were all observant, devoid of all
carelessness, his eyes and his ears never distracted.
19. 3
Having searched everywhere, Sudhana finally saw, in the center of the
land of Vetramūlaka, the town of Samanta mukha. It was a town with ten
thousand marketplaces. It was excellently built. It was encircled by a strong
wall that was very high. It was beautified by having eight crossroads.
19. 4
In the middle of the town, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw the
perfume seller Samanta netra in a perfume shop. [F.20.a] He approached the
perfume seller Samanta netra, bowed his head to Samanta netra’s feet, and sat
down before him. With his hands together in homage, he said, “Ārya, I have


---

developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do
not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what
way they should practice it.”
Samanta netra said, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent that you have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.
19. 5
“Noble one, I know the illnesses of all beings: those that come from air,
those that come from bile, those that come from phlegm, those that come
from their balance being disturbed, those that come from harm by others,
and those that come from nonhuman beings, from drinking poison, from the
effects of various mantras, weapons, and vetālas, from the agitation of water,
and from various fears and terrors. I know them all. I also know how to cure
all those illnesses. I know oiling, emetics, purgatives, enemas, bloodletting,
inhalations, 
sweating, 
compresses, 
unguents, 
massaging, 
antidotes,
exorcisms, nourishment, bathing, resting, causing growth, purifying the
complexion, and increasing strength.
19. 6
“Noble one, I cure all the illnesses of all the beings who come to me from
the ten directions. When I have healed them, I have them bathed, their
bodies anointed with unguents, their limbs adorned with jewelry, and their
bodies dressed in clothes; I satisfy them with foods that have various kinds
of excellent flavors [F.20.b] and make them fortunate with immeasurable
wealth.
19. 7
“Afterward I teach them the Dharma so that through being taught
impurity they will eliminate desire.
“I teach them the Dharma so that through the praising of love they will
eliminate anger.
19. 8
“I teach them the Dharma so that through the teaching of the particular
categories of phenomena they will eliminate ignorance.
“I teach them the Dharma so that through the teaching of the gateways to
the ways of special realizations they will eliminate the conduct that comes
from all kleśas equally.
19. 9
“I elucidate for them the cause for the arising of the aspiration for
enlightenment by relating to them descriptions of the phenomena that are
the qualities of the buddhas.
“I teach them the cause for the arising of great compassion by teaching
them the immeasurable sufferings of saṃsāra.
19. 10
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of measureless
qualities by praising the gathering of a vast accumulation of merit and
wisdom.
“I teach them the cause for the arising of Mahāyāna prayers by teaching
them how all beings should be ripened and guided.


---

19. 11
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the completely
good conduct of the bodhisattva by explaining the vast net of their conduct
of dwelling in all buddha realms and all kalpas.
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of a buddha’s body
adorned with the signs and features of a great being by praising the
perfection of generosity.
19. 12
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the pure
tathāgata’s body that can be anywhere by describing the perfection of good
conduct.
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the tathāgata’s
body with its inconceivable, pure color by describing the perfection of
patience. I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the
tathāgata’s invincible body by describing the perfection of diligence. [F.21.a]
19. 13
“I teach them the cause for the arising and attainment of the tathāgata’s
pure body, which is unsurpassable and overwhelming, by describing the
perfection of meditation.
“I teach the pure Dharma body by describing the perfection of wisdom.
19. 14
“I teach the pure and pristine body manifesting to all beings by describing
the perfection of skillful method.
“I teach the pure body that accompanies the minds of beings during all
kalpas by describing the perfection of prayer.
19. 15
“I teach the pure bodies that arise in all buddha realms by describing the
perfection of strength.
“I teach the pure bodies that satisfy all beings in accordance with their
wishes by describing the perfection of knowledge.
19. 16
“I teach the pure body that is the highest goodness by describing the
rejection of all bad qualities.
19. 17
“In that way, those comprise the generosity of giving the Dharma. I also
support them by distributing an accumulation of endless wealth and jewels.
19. 18
“Noble one, I also know about all perfumes, incenses, aromas,
infusions,
 ointments, and their combinations.
998
19. 19
“In that way, I know all combinations of perfumes: kings of perfumes such
as sesame, kings of perfumes such as chaste tree, kings of perfumes such as
ajivāti, kings of perfumes such as vibodhana, kings of perfumes such as
aruṇavati, kings of perfumes such as yellow sandalwood, kings of perfumes
such as uragasāra sandalwood, kings of perfumes such as cloud agarwood,
and kings of perfumes such as akṣobhyendriya. [F.21.b]
19. 20
“Also, noble one, I know the kind of perfume that will satisfy all beings
and through which one sees, makes offering to, and honors the buddhas
anywhere.


---

19. 21
“Noble one, through this kind of perfume that will satisfy all beings and
through which one sees, makes offering to, and honors the buddhas
anywhere, all of my wishes are fulfilled. Through its power I manifest clouds
of adornments that will protect all beings. In that way, I manifest clouds of
perfume that form aerial palaces
 and so on, up to clouds of adornments
that venerate and make offerings to all the tathāgatas.
999
19. 22
“Thus, noble one, when I wish to make offerings to the tathāgatas, then
from this form of perfume that will satisfy all beings and through which one
sees, makes offering to, and honors the buddhas anywhere, I manifest
clouds of perfume that form countless kūṭāgāras, and throughout the realm
of phenomena I manifest clouds of perfume in the form of kūṭāgāras that
adorn the assemblies of the followers of the tathāgatas present throughout
the realm of phenomena in the ten directions.
19. 23
“All the pure buddha realms become adorned by clouds, an adornment of
clouds as palaces of perfume, an adornment of clouds as walls of perfume,
an adornment of clouds as ornamental roofs of perfume, an adornment of
clouds as toraṇas of perfume, an adornment of clouds as windows of
perfume, an adornment of clouds as balconies of perfume, an adornment of
clouds as a crescent moon of perfume, an adornment of clouds as parasols of
perfume, an adornment of clouds as erected banners of perfume, an
adornment of clouds as flags of perfume, an adornment of clouds as
canopies of perfume, an adornment of clouds as nets of strings of beads of
perfume, [F.22.a] an adornment of clouds as lights of perfume, an adornment
of clouds as a display of the stainless radiances of perfume, and an
adornment of rain from clouds of all perfume.
19. 24
“Noble one, I know only this Dharma gateway called the forms of perfume
that satisfy all beings and through which in every way one sees, makes offerings to, and
honors the buddhas. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
the bodhisattvas who are like kings of medicine, who are beneficial to see,
who are beneficial to be with, who are beneficial to think of, whose self-
discipline is beneficial to follow, whose names are beneficial to hear, the
mere sight of whom causes the kleśas of all beings to cease, the mere sight of
whom causes beings to turn away from the existences in the lower realms,
the mere sight of whom causes all beings to gain the opportunity to receive
the Buddhadharma, the mere sight of whom causes the mass of suffering of
beings to end, the mere sight of whom causes all beings to be free of the fear
of all the existences in saṃsāra, the mere sight of whom causes all beings to
be resolute in going in the direction of omniscience and therefore attain
fearlessness, the mere sight of whom causes beings not to fall into the

crevasse or chasm of old age and death, and the mere sight of whom causes
beings to rest in the equality of the realm of phenomena and therefore attain
the bliss of nirvāṇa?
19. 25
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called
Tāladhvaja. There dwells a king by the name of Anala. Go to him and ask
him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
19. 26
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
perfume-seller head merchant Samanta netra, [F.22.b] circumambulated the
perfume-seller head merchant Samanta netra many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from the perfume-seller head merchant Samanta netra.

Chapter 20
ANALA
20. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembered the succession of his
kalyāṇamitras. He thought about the gateways of their instructions. He was
content in his mind, thinking, “I have been accepted as a pupil by the
kalyāṇamitras.” He observed in his mind, “I am under the protection of the
kalyāṇamitras, and I will never regress in my progress toward the highest,
complete enlightenment.” Thinking this, his mind was happy, his mind was
serene, his mind was pleased, his mind was gladdened, his mind was
delighted, his mind was joyful,
 his mind was strong,
 his mind was
soothed, his mind was vast, his mind was adorned, his mind was
unimpeded, his mind was unobscured, his mind was clear, his mind was
composed, his mind had power, his mind had supremacy, his mind
comprehended the Dharma, his mind pervaded the realms, his mind was
adorned by the vision of the buddhas, and his mind never stopped focusing
on the ten strengths.
1000
1001
20. 2
Sudhana went from land to land, town to town, district to district, and
eventually he reached the town of Tāladhvaja.
He asked, “Where is King Anala?”
20. 3
People told him, “Noble one, King Anala sits on the lion throne here
performing the activities of a king in order to accomplish the duties of a king.
He rules
 the realm. He penalizes those who deserve to be penalized. He
favors those who should be favored. He condemns criminals to punishment.
[F.23.a] He makes the decisions on legal disputes. He brings relief to those
who are low. He humbles the arrogant. He turns the people away from
killing. He dissuades them from theft. He causes them to cease yearning for
those who belong to others. He makes them turn away from lying. He makes
them desist from slander. He makes them cease speaking harshly. He makes
them avoid idle talk. He causes their minds to be free from craving. He
makes them dispel malice. He makes them disengage from false views.”
1002


---

20. 4
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went to where King Anala was.
He saw King Anala seated on a great lion throne that was beautified by
various powerful diamond jewels. It had legs that shone with countless and
various kinds of jewels. It had a beautiful form adorned and beautified by
numerous jewels. It was perfectly covered with a network of gold threads. It
was illuminated by numerous precious lamps. It had a center of lotuses made
from the precious jewels called the king of power. It had many layers of
beautiful cushions made of precious divine materials. It was perfumed by the
aroma of the various divine incenses arranged around it.
 It was made
magnificent by a hundred thousand erected precious banners. It was
beautified by a hundred thousand raised precious flags. It was beautified by
arrangements of clusters of precious flowers. It was covered from above by
various canopies made of precious divine materials.
1003
20. 5
King Anala was a youth who had reached adulthood. He was handsome
and attractive. His hair was deep black and curled to the right. His head was
like a parasol, with an uṣṇīṣa on the crown of his head. He had a broad
forehead and wide, deep black eyes. [F.23.b] His eyelashes were like the
eyelashes of a cow. His nose was lovely, high and prominent.
 His lips
were the beautiful color of vermilion and perfectly proportioned. His teeth
were even, without gaps, very white, and a full forty in number. He had jaws
like a lion. His cheeks were full and wide. His eyebrows were long, beautiful,
and curved like a bow. He had the mark of the ūrṇā hair the color of the
moon. His earlobes were long and hung loosely. His face was bright and
beautiful like the full moon. His throat was round and as beautiful as a
conch. His heart area was adorned by the śrīvatsa. His upper body was like
the upper body of a lion. The flesh between his shoulder blades was
muscular. His shoulders were bulky and rounded. His arms were long. His
fingers were webbed. His hands and feet were adorned by wheels. His
hands and feet were soft, young, and thick. He had the seven prominences.
His waist was slim like a vajra’s. His body was big and straight. His thighs
were round. His penis was retracted into his body. His calves were like the
calves of a female blackbuck. His fingers were long. The heels of his feet
were wide. He had a halo a fathom in width. He was golden in color. Each of
his body hairs was curled upward to the right. He had the circular
symmetry
 of a king banyan tree. He was adorned by the signs and
features of a superior being.
1004
1005
20. 6
He wore a precious wish-fulfilling jewel as his topknot crest. His forehead
was adorned by the adornment of a crescent moon made from Jambu River
gold. Stainless sapphire jewel earrings hung from his ears. He had a wide,
stainless upper body. His arms were beautified by armlets and bracelets
made of sublime divine jewels.


---

20. 7
Held above
 him was a precious great parasol with a stainless precious
handle of beryl; [F.24.a] with a covering made of Jambu River gold; with a
pure, large,
 precious asteria jewel in the center; and with a string of
precious little bells from which came sweet, pleasant sounds; the light from
its precious jewels shone in all directions.
1006
1007
20. 8
He had attained the majesty and sovereignty of a king who could not be
harmed by enemy armies. He had such power that he had no fear of enemy
armies. He had an entourage of ten thousand ministers dedicated to
accomplishing whatever the king required.
20. 9
Sudhana saw that in front of King Anala there were those who carried out
his punishments. They resembled the guardians in the hells. They wore
terrifying clothing like the servants of Yama. They were ferocious, horrible,
and greatly terrifying. Their eyes were red, and they were biting their lower
lips. Their faces had the threefold lines of frowning wrathfully. They were
holding weapons and tools such as swords, axes, spears, short spears, clubs,
long spears, and so on. They had ugly, terrifying faces. They were like a
black cloud, emitting horrible, dreadful shouts of rage, unbearable to look at,
inspiring great terror, and bringing fear into the hearts of a hundred
thousand beings, and they were dedicated to punishing those deserving of
punishment.
20. 10
He saw many hundreds of thousands of individuals who had committed
various crimes, each bound tightly with five ropes, brought before King
Anala. There were thieves; those who had seized others’ property; those
who had destroyed the property of others; those who had robbed travelers;
those who had burned down villages, towns, and markets; those who had
slain families;
 those who were burglars; those who had injured; those
who had poisoned; those who had rioted; those who had murdered; those
who had seduced the wives of others; those with a bad way of life; those
with evil intentions; and those who were covetous. [F.24.b]
1008
20. 11
Sudhana saw King Anala have them punished in various ways.
Sudhana saw, according to King Anala’s commands, some having their
hands and feet cut off, some their ears and noses cut off, some their eyes
gouged out, and some their limbs and all the smaller parts of the bodies cut
off. Some were decapitated, some were burned alive, some had their skin
destroyed by boiling salt water being poured over their bodies, and there
were various other punishments that were horrible, harsh, cruel, dreadful,
and deadly.
20. 12
Sudhana saw that at the site of the executions there was a mound of the
feet, hands, ears, eyes, noses, heads, limbs, and smaller parts of the bodies of
those who had been executed that was as large as Sumeru.


---

20. 13
He saw a lake of blood that was three yojanas deep and many yojanas
wide.
He saw there many hundreds of thousands of the skeletons of the dead,
missing their limbs, smaller parts, and heads. The place was filled with many
wolves, jackals,
 dogs, ravens, vultures, buzzards, and eagles.
1009
1010
20. 14
He saw that some bodies were darkened to black, some were rotting, some
were bloated, and some were filled with maggots, loathsome and terrifying.
20. 15
He heard the sounds of the loud, horrible screams of pain, the pitiful
wailing being emitted by those being executed, being slain,
 and being
slaughtered
 in various ways; the sounds of their horror and distress were
like those of the beings in the great Saṃghāta hell.
1011
1012
20. 16
When Sudhana saw this dreadful and terrifying violence, he thought, “I
am set on the highest, complete enlightenment and am dedicated to seeking
the bodhisattva conduct in order to benefit and bring happiness to all beings.
The kalyāṇamitras always ask, ‘What good actions has a bodhisattva done?
What bad actions have been avoided?’ But this King Anala is devoid of the
qualities of good actions. [F.25.a] He is engaged in great transgressive acts.
He has wicked thoughts in his mind. He is engaged in taking the lives of
others. He is dedicated to harming other beings. He has no concern for his
next life. He is at the edge of the precipice of the lower realms. What
bodhisattva conduct could I hear from him?”
20. 17
While Sudhana, who was motivated to protect the entire realm of beings,
whose mind had developed great compassion, was thinking and
contemplating in that way, devas who were up in the sky above him
addressed him in this way: “Noble one, do you not remember the
instructions of the kalyāṇamitra ṛṣi Jayoṣmāyatana?”
Sudhana looked up into the realm of the sky and answered, “Yes, I
remember.”
20. 18
The devas said, “Noble one, do not doubt in this way the instruction of the
kalyāṇamitra! Noble one, the kalyāṇamitras give correct guidance and never
do so incorrectly. Noble one, the wisdom of the bodhisattvas in practicing
skillful methods is inconceivable. Their wisdom in gathering beings as
pupils is inconceivable. Their wisdom in benefiting beings is inconceivable.
Their wisdom in subjugating
 beings is inconceivable. Their wisdom in
inspiring beings is inconceivable. Their wisdom in purifying beings is
inconceivable. Their wisdom in protecting beings is inconceivable. Their
wisdom in leading beings to understanding is inconceivable. Their wisdom
in ripening beings is inconceivable. Their wisdom in guiding beings is
inconceivable.
1013
“Noble one, go and ask him about bodhisattva conduct!”


---

20. 19
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, listened to what the devas had said
[F.25.b] and approached the king. When he had reached him, Sudhana
bowed his head to the feet of King Anala, circumambulated him, keeping
him to his right, many hundreds of thousands of times, and then sat before
him and with palms together and said, “Ārya, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
should practice it.
20. 20
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
20. 21
King Anala, having concluded his duties as a king, rose from his lion
throne, and with his right hand he took hold of Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, and led him into the Tāladhvaja Palace.
20. 22
When they had entered his residence, the king led Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, into the harem, where he sat upon a throne and said to
Sudhana, “Noble one, look around at my home and possessions!”
20. 23
Sudhana looked around and saw that the building was huge and vast,
encircled by walls made of the seven precious materials. It was beautified by
a variety of palaces of precious jewels, adorned with many hundreds of
thousands of precious kūṭāgāras. It was brilliantly bright with the shining
light of countless precious jewels. There were pillars made of red pearls that
were beautified by arrangements of a shining variety of different precious
jewels. Inside was a beautifully constructed lion throne made of white coral
that was adorned with many hundreds of thousands of jewels. There were
raised lion banners made of precious asteria
 jewels. Above the throne
was a canopy of shining, precious jewels. The room was covered with nets of
strings of various wish-fulfilling precious jewels. [F.26.a] It was adorned by
an array of ornamental spires adorned by a countless variety of precious
jewels. There were pools made from emeralds that were filled with cool
water. It was encircled by trees made of various precious materials.
1014
20. 24
Sudhana saw that the ten million women of the king’s entourage were
beautiful, attractive, and pretty; had the most perfect, magnificent color; had
mastered all skills; rose before him and slept after him; had loving minds; did
whatever they were told to do; and were obedient.
20. 25
Then King Anala asked Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one,
what do you think? Is there this kind of ripening of karma for those who
have committed bad actions? Is there this kind of perfect body? Is there this
kind of perfect great happiness? Is there this kind of perfect attainment of
sovereignty and great power?”
Sudhana replied, “Ārya, there are no such things.”


---

20. 26
King Anala said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation
called the attainment of illusions. Noble one, most of the inhabitants of my
kingdom kill, steal, practice sexual misconduct, lie, slander, abuse, indulge in
idle talk, are avaricious, are malicious, hold false views, commit bad actions,
and are fierce, aggressive, and cruel, and they maintain a behavior
consisting of all kinds of bad actions.
“There is no other way to instruct them to turn away, to desist, from that
sinful behavior.
20. 27
“Noble one, in order to guide, ripen, control, and benefit these beings,
motivated by great compassion I manifest the illusory images of
executioners, [F.26.b] through which I execute the illusory images of the
condemned. I make the illusions of those who punish and execute in various
ways the illusions of those who have followed a path of bad actions. I also
emanate those who experience the unendurable sufferings of having their
feet, hands, noses, ears, limbs, smaller parts, and heads cut off. When the
beings who live in my realm see that, they become distressed, afraid, and
terrified. After that, they are careful to avoid committing bad actions.
20. 28
“Noble one, when in that way I have used that method and see that these
beings are distressed, terrified, and alarmed, I then turn them away from the
path of the ten bad actions, cause them to possess the path of the ten good
actions, and establish them in the path to omniscience, which is the ultimate
attainment of joy and happiness and the cessation of all suffering.
20. 29
“Noble one, I do not cause harm to any being with my body, speech, or
mind.
“Noble one, I would wander in the most extreme suffering of the Avīci
hell, but I would not even once have arise in my mind the wish to cause
harm to even the smallest being, a minute insect seen on the tip of a blade of
grass, existing in the realm of stupidity, which is rebirth as an animal, let
alone to a human being in my realm, who has the ability to develop the path
of good actions.
20. 30
“Noble one, I do not generate the qualities of a bad action in my dreams,
let alone deliberately.
20. 31
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the attainment of
illusions. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
bodhisattvas who have attained the patience of the birthlessness of
phenomena, who have realized that all states of existence are illusions, who
have given rise to the bodhisattva conduct that is like an illusion, who know
that all worlds are like reflections, [F.27.a] who have realized that the nature
of phenomena is like a dream, who follow the way of the unimpeded
gateway to the realm of the Dharma, who have understood that the net of
conduct is like a magical illusion,
 who have the scope of the range of
1015


---

unobscured wisdom, who have set forth on the path of unobscured samādhi,
who have gained the power of retention
 that has an infinite capacity, and
who comprehend the scope of the range of activity of the buddhas?
1016
20. 32
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a city called Suprabha.
There dwells a king by the name of Mahāprabha. Go to him and ask him,
‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
20. 33
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
King Anala, circumambulated King Anala many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from King Anala.

Chapter 21
MAHĀPRABHA
21. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembered that illusion of wisdom. He
contemplated the bodhisattva’s liberation that had the form of illusion. He
examined the illusory aspect of the nature of phenomena. He comprehended
the equality of the illusions of actions. He reflected on the equality of the
illusions of phenomena. He comprehended the equality of the emanations
that are ripened by the Dharma. He followed the inconceivable appearances
that arise from wisdom. He accomplished the accomplishment of the
illusions of infinite prayer. He purified the unimpeded conduct that has the
true nature of an illusory manifestation. He analyzed the three times as
having the characteristics of being composed of illusions.
21. 2
In one land after another, he questioned, searched, and looked around,
seeking without weariness of the mind or exhaustion of the body
throughout all the main and intermediate directions, roads, [F.27.b] valleys,
and plains, even and uneven ground, wet lands and dry lands, mountains
and caves, villages and towns, markets, lands, kingdoms, and capitals. He
reached the vicinity of the city of Suprabha and asked, “Where is King
Mahāprabha?”
Many people told him, “Noble one, that over there is the city named
Suprabha. King Mahāprabha lives there.”
21. 3
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the city of Suprabha
and saw the great city of Suprabha. Seeing it, he was overjoyed, pleased,
content, and happy. He thought, “I am looking at the place where my
kalyāṇamitra lives. Today I will see the kalyāṇamitra. I will hear from him the
bodhisattva conduct, and I will hear from him the inconceivable
gateways through which the bodhisattva sets forth, the inconceivable true
nature of a bodhisattva, the inconceivable qualities of a bodhisattva, the
inconceivable range of activity of a bodhisattva, the inconceivable powerful
1017


---

supremacy of a bodhisattva, the inconceivable samādhis practiced by a
bodhisattva, the inconceivable liberations enjoyed by a bodhisattva, and the
inconceivable pure fulfillment of the undertakings of a bodhisattva.”
21. 4
Concentrating on those thoughts, Sudhana approached the city of
Suprabha, and having arrived he looked at the city of Suprabha. It was
encircled by seven wonderful and beautiful moats that were trenches of the
seven precious materials —gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red pearls, emeralds,
and white coral —filled with water, with a layer of gold sand at their bottoms,
[F.28.a] their surfaces covered with divine blue lotuses, red lotuses, night
lotuses, and white lotuses and the water made turbid with
 yellow
sandalwood mud. It was encircled by seven rows of palm trees made of the
seven precious materials. It was encircled by seven walls made of diamonds:
these were a wall of lovely lion diamonds, a wall of undefeatable diamonds, a
wall of powerfully penetrative diamonds, a wall of invincible diamonds, a
strong wall of unimpedable, resolute diamonds, a wall that contained a
network of the light rays of diamonds, and a wall of the array of the
immaculate colors of diamonds. All those great
 walls of precious
diamonds were studded with countless precious jewels. They were adorned
with shining railings of Jambu River gold on which were strung strings of
ivory beads, shining railings of silver jewels on which were strung strings of
ivory beads, shining railings of beryl jewels on which were strung strings of
ivory beads, shining railings of crystal jewels on which were strung strings
of ivory beads, shining railings of coral jewels on which were strung strings
of ivory beads, shining railings of red pearls on which were strung strings of
ivory beads, and shining railings of pearl jewels, the essence of the oceans,
on which were strung strings of ivory beads.

The distance between each of the eight great gateways of the city was ten
yojanas. The gates were multicolored, beautifully made of the seven precious
materials.
21. 6
That great city was vast, huge, and divided into eight districts. The ground
was made of blue beryl. There were a hundred million streets in that city, and
on both sides of each street there were a hundred thousand well-built and
arranged mansions in which many hundreds of billions of beings lived. All
those houses were made of the seven precious materials, were adorned with
an array of various jewels, [F.28.b] had precious parasols and banners
erected upon them, and were endowed with all requisites.
21. 7
That great city was beautified by high buildings that had the countless
colors of precious jewels: There were countless kūṭāgāras of Jambu River
gold, with an inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of strings
of beryl jewels. There were countless kūṭāgāras of silver, with an
inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of strings of red pearls.

There were countless kūṭāgāras of beryl, with an inconceivable array of
jewels, covered in a network of strings of a treasure of precious jewels. There
were countless kūṭāgāras of crystal, with an inconceivable array of jewels,
covered in a network of strings of the kings of jewels called abundant essence.
There were countless kūṭāgāras of jewels that delight beings, with an
inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of strings of the kings of
jewels called sunstones. There were countless kūṭāgāras of sapphires, with
an inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of strings of the kings
of jewels called light rays of splendor jewels. There were countless kūṭāgāras of
the precious jewel ocean of beings, with an inconceivable array of jewels,
covered in a network of strings of the kings of jewels called asterias.
There were countless kūṭāgāras of diamonds, with an inconceivable array of
jewels, covered in a network of strings of the kings of jewels called invincible
banners.
 There were countless kūṭāgāras of yellow sandalwood, with an
inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network
 of divine coral tree
flowers. [F.29.a] There were countless kūṭāgāras of the unequaled king of
perfumes, with an inconceivable array of jewels, covered in a network of a
variety of divine flowers.
1020
1021
1022
21. 8
Each of those precious houses was adorned with many precious rooftop
railings,
 was encircled by seven levels of precious balconies,
 and had
seven rows of precious palm trees arranged around it. Precious strings
connected all the precious rooftop railings and the precious palm trees. Lines
of golden bells adorned all those precious strings. Hanging wreaths of
flowers were fastened to all those golden bells, and a network of precious
little spherical bells hung from all those wreaths of flowers.
1023
1024
21. 9
In that way, the entire great city was covered in countless networks of
precious jewels, was covered in countless networks of precious bells and
little spherical bells, was covered in countless networks of divine perfumes,
was covered in countless networks of divine flowers, was covered in
countless networks of precious spheres, was covered in countless diamond
canopies, was covered in countless precious canopies, was covered in
countless precious parasols, was covered in countless precious kūṭāgāra
canopies, was covered in countless precious cloth canopies, and was
covered in countless canopies of flower garlands. Precious parasols and
banners had been erected throughout the great city.
21. 10
In the center of the great city of Suprabha was King Mahāprabha’s palace.
[F.29.b] The palace was four yojanas wide on every side, was made of the
seven precious materials, was encircled by seven levels of balconies, had
seven levels of networks of precious little spherical bells that emitted a


---

beautiful sound, was encircled by seven rows of palm trees made of the
seven precious materials, and was adorned by an inconceivable hundred
thousand kūṭāgāras made of various precious materials.
21. 11
It had pools made of a variety of precious materials, with bottoms covered
in gold sand, filled with water that had the eight excellent qualities, and its
surface was covered with blue lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses.
They were beautified by trees that had flowers and fruits of every kind of
precious material. On all four sides there were beautiful precious railings
intersected by steps. There were the divine, sweet, and melodious songs of
flocks of birds.
21. 12
In the center of this palace, which rivaled that of Devendra,
 there was a
precious kūṭāgāra that shone on beings. It was adorned with a splendid
display of countless, beautiful jewels. It was a treasury of the good Dharma
that had been established by King Mahāprabha.
1025
21. 13
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had no attachment toward the
precious moats, he was not astonished by the precious walls, he had no
craving for the rows of precious palm trees, he took no delight in the sounds
from the networks of bells and little spherical bells, he had no clinging to the
melodious sounds of the divine music and songs, he paid no attention to the
delights of the celestial kūṭāgāras composed of various shining jewels, he
found no pleasure in the pleasurable qualities of the groups of young men
and women, and he was detached from the pleasures of form, sound, smell,
taste, and touch. [F.30.a]
21. 14
Focused on the contemplation of the Dharma, he asked whomever he met
about the kalyāṇamitra. In that way, he eventually arrived at a place in the
city where three roads met, and he looked around. He saw that not far from a
caitya temple in the center of the junction of the three roads was a great
throne with great adornments. It had legs of blue beryl, was supported by
white beryl lions, was inlaid with a network of threads of Jambu River gold,
and had various precious cushions, superior to divine materials, laid upon it.
It was adorned by countless precious disks and covered with an
inconceivable network of an array of precious jewels. Above it there was a
canopy like a tent made of cloth of Jambu River gold, with a variety of divine
precious materials and a central lotus made of the kings of wish-fulfilling
jewels.
21. 15
Seated cross-legged on that great Dharma throne was King Mahāprabha,
whose body was adorned by the thirty-two signs of a great being. His body
was beautified by the complete variety of the eighty features of a great being.
He was like a mountain of gold. He was adorned with an array of various
jewels. He shone magnificently like the disk of the sun. He was lovely to
look at like the disk of the full moon. He was beautiful like Brahmā in the


---

midst of his retinue of Brahmā devas. He was like the ocean, possessing an
accumulation of the jewels of the infinite qualities of the Dharma. Like a
great cloud he emitted the thunder that was the nature of the Dharma. Like
the sky he was adorned by the stars of the ways of the Dharma. Like Sumeru
his image appeared in the minds of the ocean of the four classes of beings.
Like an island of jewels he was a ground filled with the jewels of various
knowledges.
21. 16
Sudhana saw that arranged in front of King Mahāprabha there was a
precious heap of gold, jewels, pearls, beryls, conch, crystal, corals, gold
ornaments, and silver; a heap of divine clothing in various colors; [F.30.b] a
heap of various kinds of divine jewelry; a heap of food and various gifts; a
heap of the various kinds of superior, supremely delicious flavors; and a
heap of a range of all kinds of displays.
21. 17
Sudhana saw many trillions of precious divine carriages, many trillions of
precious divine musical instruments, many trillions of different kinds of
divine perfumes, many heaps of medicine for healing sickness, and heaps of
all kinds of particular utensils that were suitable, faultless, and for beings to
use as they wish.
21. 18
Sudhana saw a hundred thousand young milk-yielding cows with golden
horns and hooves set out for poor people to obtain.
21. 19
Sudhana saw a quintillion precious maidens who had been assembled.
They were beautiful, attractive, and lovely to look at. They were adorned in
all jewelry and wore precious clothing of divine material, their bodies
anointed with divine uragasāra sandalwood. They had mastered the sixty-
four skills and were expert in all the arts of lovemaking.
21. 20
Sudhana saw all these requisites gathered and arranged in front of the
king for beings to collect, for beings to take, to bring happiness to beings, to
bring joy to beings, to bring peace of mind to beings, to bring delight to
beings, to cause the kleśas to cease within beings, to lead beings to the
meaning of the nature of all phenomena, to direct beings to the meaning that
is the same as omniscience, to turn beings away from ill will toward others,
to turn beings away from bad physical and vocal actions, to extract the
splinter of false views from beings, and for beings to purify their path of
action.
 They were piled up and presented on two hundred million
platforms at every crossroads of four streets, at every junction of three
streets, and in front of the rows of doors and courtyards [F.31.a] on both
sides of every street.
1026
21. 21
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, prostrated his whole body onto the
ground in homage to King Mahāprabha, and he circumambulated King
Mahāprabha, keeping him to his right, many hundreds of thousands of
times. He then sat down before him, placed the palms of his hands together,


---

and said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
21. 22
“Ārya, I have heard that you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas.
Therefore, Ārya, teach me how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct
and in what way they practice it!”
21. 23
King Mahāprabha said, “Noble one, I have purified and perfected the
bodhisattva conduct called the banner of great love.
21. 24
“Noble one, I addressed questions about this bodhisattva conduct called
the banner of great love to many hundreds of buddhas, many thousands of
buddhas, many hundreds of thousands of buddhas, many quintillions of
buddhas, and so on up to an innumerable number of innumerable numbers
of buddha bhagavats. From them I received it, purified it, completely purified
it,
 established it, viewed it, analyzed it, followed it,
 sought it,
examined it, wrote it out,
 and promulgated it.
1027
1028
1029
21. 25
“Noble one, in that way I have remained in this bodhisattva conduct called
the banner of great love, and I rule
 the kingdom in accord with the Dharma, I
take care of the world in accord with the Dharma, I carry out conduct in the
world in accord with the Dharma, I cause beings to be in accord with
Dharma, [F.31.b] I bring beings into the domain of the Dharma, I bring beings
into the way of the Dharma, I command beings in accord with Dharma, I
make beings dedicate themselves to the practice of the Dharma, I establish
beings in the understanding of the nature of the Dharma, and I establish
beings in a loving state of mind,
 in the power of great love, in the
strength of love, in an altruistic state of mind, in a happy state of mind, in a
sympathetic
 state of mind, in a caring state of mind, in a protective state
of mind,
 in a state of mind that never ceases to be protective of beings,
and in a state of mind of continuously aspiring to eliminate all suffering, and
I establish beings in a continuous conduct that leads them to the ultimate
happiness.
1030
1031
1032
1033
21. 26
“I also bring physical
 ease to beings by giving rise to the happiness of
serenity. I turn the continuums of their minds away from
 attachment to
the pleasures of saṃsāra. I bring
 beings to delight in the pleasures of the
Dharma. I cleanse them of all the stains of the kleśas.
 I purify them of all
bad qualities. I turn them away from the continuum of saṃsāra. I turn them
toward the ocean of the ways of the realm of Dharma. I burn away the
ignorance in their minds in order to end all rebirths in the states of existence.
I cause light
 to arise in their minds so that they attain the result that is
omniscience. I make the ocean of their minds clear so that they will give rise
to the strength of unassailable faith.

“Noble one, in that way I have remained in this bodhisattva conduct called

 the kingdom in accord with the Dharma.
1039
21. 28
“Noble one, I do not cause the beings who dwell in my realm to be
frightened, terrified, or [F.32.a] alarmed or to horripilate.
21. 29
“Noble one, those beings who are poor and deprived of necessities, who
wish for food, who wish for drink, who wish for clothes, and who wish for
every kind of requisite all come before me. I open the door to the treasures
that I have previously accumulated, and I say to them, ‘Take whatever you
wish —all those things for which you would otherwise engage in the bad
actions of killing, taking what has not been given, sexual misconduct, lying,
slander, harsh speech, idle talk, craving, malice, false views, and attachment
to various incorrect views! All of those things have been provided by me,
and they are heaped at the doors in the streets, in the courtyards, at the
junctions of three streets, and at the crossroads of four streets in this great
city of Suprabha —anyone may take whatever they wish!’ I tell them this and
give it to them.
21. 30
“Noble one, all the beings who dwell in this great city are bodhisattvas
who follow the Mahāyāna.
21. 31
“Noble one, this great city of Suprabha appears to them in accordance
with their way of thinking: to some it appears small, while to some it appears
vast; to some the ground appears to be made of earth, while to some the
ground appears to be made of beryl jewels; to some it appears to be encircled
by a wall of clay, while to some it appears to be encircled by a wall of
precious diamonds
 and banners of invincibility; to some it appears to be
filled with pebbles and potsherds, to be uphill and downhill, and to have
many chasms and precipices, while to some it appears to have ground that is
covered and adorned with countless excellent precious jewels and to be as
flat as the palm of the hand; to some it appears to be made of earth,
 while
to some it appears to be adorned by countless precious dwellings, aerial
palaces, mansions, and kūṭāgāras [F.32.b] adorned by roof decks with
balustrades, spires, round windows,
 networks of strings of beads,
crescent moons, and trellises of lion adornments.

1041
1042
21. 32
“Among the beings who live outside the city, there are those who, when I
was practicing bodhisattva conduct in past lives, gathered around me as
pupils through the four methods of gathering pupils. They have pure
motivation, have created the roots of merit, have served many buddhas,
aspire to omniscience, and are set on omniscience. To them the city appears
to be made of jewels. To the others it appears to be made of earth.
21. 33
“Noble one, when the beings who live in my realm, in the districts and
subdistricts, in the villages, towns, and markets, in the country and the
capital, are disturbed by the nature of the times in a world that has the five

degenerations and want to practice the path of the ten bad actions, then at
that time, wishing to benefit them, I enter the bodhisattva samādhi called
exercising power over the world through being motivated by great love.
21. 34
“Noble one, as soon as I rest in that samādhi, the fears, misfortunes,
hostilities, disputes, mental disturbances, and violent intentions of those
beings cease, are extinguished, are eliminated, and are brought to an end
through their attaining the nature of the bodhisattva samādhi called
exercising power over the world through being motivated by great love.
21. 35
“Noble one, stay a moment and you will see a sight.”
Then King Mahāprabha entered the bodhisattva samādhi called exercising
power over the world through being motivated by great love. [F.33.a]
21. 36
As soon as he entered the bodhisattva samādhi called exercising power over
the world through being motivated by great love, the great city of Suprabha and its
districts and subdistricts, its villages,
 towns, and markets, the land and
the kingdom, the capital, and its environs all shook in six ways.
1043
21. 37
When they shook, the precious walls, precious mansions, precious
interiors, precious houses, precious dwellings, precious aerial palaces,
precious kūṭāgāras, precious spires, precious balustrade rooftops, precious
round windows, precious balconies, precious toraṇas, precious crescents,
precious lattices of lion adornments, precious railings, precious disks,
precious canopies, precious strings of little spherical bells, precious bells,
precious banners, precious flags, and precious palm trees also shook, made
loud sounds, and jingled. When they resounded, they emitted beautiful,
delightful sounds, so that those people bowed and made obeisance in the
direction of King Mahāprabha.
21. 38
All those beings who dwelled within the great city of Suprabha
experienced increased happiness and joy, turned to face the direction of
King Mahāprabha, and prostrated their entire bodies on the ground in
homage.
21. 39
Those beings who lived in the villages, the towns, the marketplaces, the
land, the kingdom, the capital, and its environs all became blissful in mind
and body, and with happiness and joy they bowed down in the direction of
King Mahāprabha.
21. 40
The beings who had been reborn as animals all became kind toward one
another and wished to help one another. They all turned to look in the
direction of King Mahāprabha and bowed down to him.
21. 41
Even the land, all the mountain peaks, and the other lofty lands [F.33.b]
bowed toward King Mahāprabha.
21. 42
All the flowering trees, fruit trees, leafy trees, edible plants,
vegetation,
 crops,
 grasses, bushes, herbs, and forests turned in the
direction of King Mahāprabha and bowed down toward him.
1044

21. 43
All the springs,
 lakes, ponds, reservoirs, waterfalls, rivers, lotus ponds,
and wells in his realm turned and made the sounds of flowing in the
direction of King Mahāprabha.
1047
21. 44
Ten thousand nāga kings caused a mass of smoke of great black-
agarwood incense to form a cloud of perfume, from which came the
illumination of bright streaks of lightning, the roar of thunder, and a fine rain
of perfumed water that fell in all four directions.1048
21. 45
Ten thousand devas, such as the deva lords Śakra, Suyāma, Saṃtuṣita,
Sunirmita, and Vaśavartin gathered in the sky facing him and made offerings
to King Mahāprabha:
21. 46
The entire expanse of the sky resounded with the vast melodious sound
from clouds of a quintillion divine musical instruments.
21. 47
A gathering of countless apsarases created the adornment of sweet,
beautiful sounds from clouds of divine songs.
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine, precious flowers.
21. 48
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine incenses of various colors.
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine, precious garlands.
21. 49
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine powders of various colors.
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine, precious jewelry.
21. 50
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine, delicate,
 stainless clothing.
1049
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of a variety of
countless divine [F.34.a] parasols of different kinds.
21. 51
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of beautiful lion
banners.
There was the adornment of the rain that fell from clouds of countless
precious flags shining with the blazing light of divine jewels.
21. 52
Airāvaṇa and all the kings of elephants were in the sky, and through the
inconceivable miraculous powers of the lords of the elephants, the leaders of
the herds, they manifested in the sky clouds of a variety of countless divine,
precious lotuses that covered the entire expanse of the sky; of countless
divine, precious hanging strings of jewels; of countless divine, precious
hanging clusters of streamers and wreaths; of hanging adornments of
countless varieties of divine, precious flower garlands; of hanging
adornments of countless varieties of divine, precious strings of jewelry; and
of hanging adornments of countless varieties of divine, precious wreaths of

flowers; the adornment of sky-covering clouds of perfume composed of
countless varieties of divine, precious kings of scents of different colors that
filled all directions with a lovely aroma; the adornment of rain from clouds of
divine, precious clothing of various colors; the adornment of rain from
clouds of a divine mass of incense smoke; the adornment of a delicate rain
from clouds of divine powders of different colors; and the adornment of rain
from sky-covering clouds of the sweet and melodious music and songs of
praise by a host of apsarases. [F.34.b]
21. 53
Countless hundreds of thousands of rākṣasa lords who dwell in the sea
and on the land, who dwell in our world realm of four continents, whose
food is flesh and whose drink is blood, who steal the vitality of those
creatures that live in the water and of deer, cattle, birds, oxen, horses,
elephants, donkeys, men, and women, whose minds have thoughts of anger
and who always harm and injure beings, all gained the highest motivation of
love and altruism; their faces having become serene, they became dedicated
to not causing violence or injury to any being, their thoughts upon the next
world after death, and with their palms together in homage, with the highest
happiness, they bowed in the direction of King Mahāprabha, experiencing
an unequaled vast bliss of mind and body.
21. 54
Hundreds of thousands of lords of yakṣas, mahoragas, piśācas, and
bhūtas with the highest motivation of love and altruism, their faces having
become serene and their thoughts upon the next world after death, became
dedicated to not causing violence or injury to any being. With their palms
together in homage, with the highest happiness, they bowed in the direction
of King Mahāprabha, experiencing an unequaled vast bliss of mind and
body.
21. 55
In the same way, for all beings in the four-continent world realm, fear,
misfortune, hostility, disputes, mental disturbances, and violent intentions
ceased, were extinguished, were eliminated, were brought to an end, and
were eradicated.
21. 56
In the same way as it was for the four-continent world realm, so it was that
for all beings throughout the great universe of a billion worlds, [F.35.a]
throughout a quintillion world realms in the ten directions, all fear,
misfortune, hostility, disputes, mental disturbances, and sinful and violent
intentions ceased, were extinguished, were eliminated, were brought to an
end, and were eradicated through their attaining the nature of the
bodhisattva samādhi called exercising power over the world through being
motivated by great love.
21. 57
Then King Mahāprabha arose from that samādhi and said to Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, “Noble one, I know only this wisdom of bodhisattva
conduct called the banner of great love.


---

21. 58
“How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who hold the immeasurable parasol of great love; who pervade
all the world realms with their motivation to bring happiness; who are
attendants for all beings through continual attendance to them; who are
dedicated to the protection of all beings applied equally to the highest, the
middling, and the lowest beings; who have a loving motivation that is like
the earth, for it is engaged in supporting all beings; who are like the disk of
the full moon sending the light rays of merit and wisdom equally to all
beings; who are like the disk of the sun because they shine the light of
wisdom on everything that is to be known; who are like lamps because they
dispel the deep darkness in the minds of all beings; who are like the precious
jewel that purifies water because they clear away the turbidity of deceit and
deception in the lakes of the minds of all beings; who are like the king of
wish-fulfilling jewels because they fulfill the aspirations and prayers of all
beings; who are like a great wind because they make them live in the
dwelling place of resting in samādhi, which is the great city
 of
omniscience? [F.35.b]
1050
21. 59
“How could I measure their mountain of merit? How could I view the sky
that is adorned by the myriads of stars of their qualities? How could I know
the circle of air
 that is their great prayers? How could I measure their
power of the equality of all phenomena? How could I explain their praises of
the array of the Mahāyāna? How could I describe their special way of
completely good conduct? How could I reveal the gateway to the great
samādhi of the bodhisattvas? How could I describe their clouds of great
compassion?
1051
21. 60
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a capital city called
Sthirā. There dwells an upāsikā by the name of Acalā. Go to her and ask her,
‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
21. 61
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
King Mahāprabha, circumambulated King Mahāprabha many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from King Mahāprabha. [B3]

Chapter 22
ACALĀ
22. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, left the city of Suprabha, and having
followed the road for a little while, he contemplated the instruction given to
him by King Mahāprabha: he remembered the way of bodhisattva conduct
called the banner of great love; he meditated on the light of the great samādhi
called exercising power over the world; he realized
 the variegated display of
the lion throne and adornments of the pure bodhisattva body; he increased
the inconceivable power and strength of bodhisattva aspiration and merit;
[F.36.a] he made firm
 the inconceivable way of bodhisattva wisdom that
ripens beings; he reflected upon the inconceivable greatness of the general
enjoyments of the bodhisattvas; he considered the inconceivable different
aspects
 of the bodhisattvas; he remembered the inconceivable pure
ripening of beings by bodhisattvas; he thought about the inconceivable pure
and perfect bodhisattva assembly of pupils; he had conviction in the
inconceivable radiance of the bodhisattvas’ dedication to their duty to
beings; 
and 
he 
attained 
happiness, 
powerful 
attraction, 
delight,
contentment, deep joy, clarity of mind, brightness of mind, stability of mind,
vastness of mind, and inexhaustibility of mind. He was in that way dedicated
to remembering and thinking of the kalyāṇamitra.
1052
1053
1054
22. 2
With his face covered in tears, he thought “Ah! Oh! Seeing the
kalyāṇamitra is the source of all precious qualities. It perfects and purifies all
bodhisattva conduct. It makes pure all bodhisattva mindfulness. It purifies
all the domains of bodhisattva retention. It gives rise to the radiance of all
bodhisattva samādhis. It accomplishes seeing all buddhas. It brings down
the rain from the Dharma clouds of all
 the buddhas. It indicates the way
of all bodhisattva prayers. It gives rise to the inconceivable light of
knowledge and wisdom. [F.36.b] It grows the sprouts
 of stable
bodhisattva faculties. The kalyāṇamitras save me from falling into the chasm
of the lower existences. The kalyāṇamitras have brought me to the
1055
1056


---

realization of the way of the equality of phenomena. The kalyāṇamitras have
shown me the paths to happiness and to unhappiness. The kalyāṇamitras
have taught me the Mahāyāna. The kalyāṇamitras have given me the
instructions on the completely good bodhisattva conduct. The kalyāṇamitras
have shown me the road to the city of omniscience. The kalyāṇamitras have
guided me on the way to the town of omniscience. The kalyāṇamitras have
made me enter the ocean of the ways of the realm of the Dharma. The
kalyāṇamitras have taught me the ways of an ocean of what is to be known
in the three times. The kalyāṇamitras have shown me all the circles of ārya
assemblies.
 The kalyāṇamitras have increased all my good qualities.”
1057
22. 3
While he thus wept and wailed, the devas who were assembled in the sky,
who were bodhisattva devas, emissaries of the buddhas who continually
followed him and inspired him, called down to him, “Noble one, the
bodhisattvas who follow the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras greatly please
the buddha bhagavats. The bodhisattvas who never go against the words of
the kalyāṇamitras come close to omniscience. The bodhisattvas who do not
doubt the words of the kalyāṇamitras [F.37.a] come close to the
kalyāṇamitras. The bodhisattvas who always have the kalyāṇamitras in their
minds are approaching all their goals.
22. 4
“Noble one, go to the upāsikā Acalā in the royal capital of Sthirā! You will
hear the bodhisattva conduct from her.”
22. 5
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, emerged from samādhi’s light of
wisdom and eventually arrived at Sthirā, where the upāsikā Acalā was.
22. 6
He searched and looked for the upāsikā Acalā, and many people said to
him, “Noble one, the upāsikā Acalā is young and lives with her parents at
home, where, surrounded by her family, she teaches the Dharma to a great
gathering of people.”
22. 7
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, his mind filled with great
happiness, enthusiasm, and joy, went to the home of the upāsikā Acalā. After
arriving there, while he was waiting at the door he saw
 the entire house
shining with a pervading golden light that brought ease to mind and body.
The instant the light touched Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, he entered,
and there arose five hundred subtle and newly developed entrances to
samādhi such as entrances to the samādhi called power over all sensations,
entrances to the samādhi called the region of peace, entrances to the samādhi
called apart from
 all beings, entrances to the samādhi called the all-seeing
equanimity, and entrances to the samādhi called the treasure of the tathāgatas.
[F.37.b] Those samādhis were very subtle and newly developed like a
consciousness that has just entered the womb.

22. 8
Then Sudhana sensed a lovely scent of such a kind that male devas did
not have, that female devas did not have, that male nāgas did not have, that
female nāgas did not have, that male yakṣas did not have, that female yakṣas
did not have, that male gandharvas did not have, that female gandharvas did
not have, that male asuras did not have, that female asuras did not have, that
male garuḍas did not have, that female garuḍas did not have, that male
kinnaras did not have, that female kinnaras did not have, that male
mahoragas did not have, that female mahoragas did not have, that male
humans did not have, and that female humans did not have.
22. 9
There was no equal to that girl’s body in the worlds in the ten directions,
let alone one that was superior.
22. 10
Apart from the luster of the color of the bodies of the tathāgatas, and the
luster of the color of consecrated bodhisattvas, there was no one in the
worlds in the ten directions who had a body with a luster of color that
equaled the luster of color of her body, let alone one that was superior.
22. 11
Apart from the shape and figure of the bodies of the tathāgatas, and the
shape and figure of consecrated bodhisattvas, there was no one in the
worlds in the ten directions who had a body with a shape and figure that
equaled the shape and figure of her body, let alone one that was superior.
22. 12
Apart from the aura of light of the tathāgatas, and the aura of light of
consecrated bodhisattvas, there was no one in the worlds in the ten
directions who had an aura of light that equaled her aura of light, let alone
one that was superior.
22. 13
Apart from the tathāgatas and the consecrated bodhisattvas, there was no
one in the worlds in the ten directions, in the realms of devas, nāgas, yakṣas,
gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, or nonhumans,
who had a scent that equaled the scent of the breath that came from her
mouth, let alone one that was superior.
22. 14
Apart from the displays and enjoyments of the abodes of the tathāgatas,
and the displays and enjoyments of the abodes of the consecrated
bodhisattvas, [F.38.a] there was no one in the worlds in the ten directions
who could equal the displays and enjoyments of her abode, let alone anyone
who could be her superior.
22. 15
Apart from the perfect entourage of attendants of the tathāgatas and the
perfect entourage of attendants of the consecrated bodhisattvas, there was
no one in the worlds in the ten directions who could equal her perfect
entourage of attendants, let alone anyone who could be her superior.
22. 16
There was no being among the classes of beings in the worlds in the ten
directions who could look upon the upāsikā Acalā with desire.
22. 17
There was no being among the classes of beings in the worlds in the ten
directions whose kleśas did not cease as soon as they saw the upāsikā Acalā.


---

22. 18
Just as the Mahābrahmās who have power over a million desire realms
do not have kleśas arising within them, in the same way, the beings who
saw the upāsikā Acalā did not have kleśas arising within them.
1061
22. 19
There was no being among the classes of beings in the worlds in the ten
directions who had enough of looking upon the upāsikā Acalā, apart from
those who had the contentment of wisdom.
22. 20
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw the inconceivable majesty of the
upāsikā Acalā’s body and her inconceivable form, color, shape, and figure;
he saw the inconceivable network of unimpeded light rays from the entirety
of the ground, city, and jewels; and he saw the accomplishment of
inconceivable benefits for beings.
22. 21
He smelled the lovely scent that arose from all her pores, saw the infinite
perfect assembly of her attendants, saw the perfect, unassailable display of
the aerial palace that was her home, perceived the measureless ocean of its
qualities, and praised the upāsikā Acalā with this verse: [F.38.b]
22. 22
“You continually maintain a stainless good conduct.
You are completely pervaded
 by vast patience.
1062
You are established in diligence as firm as a vajra.
You are superior among beings like the shining lord
 of mountains.”
{1}
1063
1064
22. 23
After Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had praised the upāsikā Acalā with
that verse, he said to her, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas
should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I
pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
22. 24
The upāsikā Acalā spoke with a gentle, beautiful, delightful voice to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, with words that brought him joy, saying,
“Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration
for the highest, complete enlightenment.
22. 25
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the essence of
wisdom that is difficult to attain. I train in the gateway of bodhisattva conduct
that possesses a strong commitment. I have attained the gateway of the
power of retention of the level of the equality of all phenomena. I have
attained the gateway called the light of the wisdom of eloquence that elucidates
the basis
 of all phenomena, [F.39.a] and I have attained the gateway of
the samādhi called the display of the tireless search for the Dharma.”
1065


---

22. 26
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is the scope of the bodhisattva liberation
called the essence of the wisdom that is difficult to attain? What is the scope of the
gateway of bodhisattva conduct with a strong commitment, of the gateway
of maintaining the level of the equality of all phenomena, of the gateway of
the light of the wisdom of eloquence that elucidates the basis
 of all
phenomena, and of the gateway of the samādhi called the display of the tireless
search for the Dharma?”
1066
Acalā answered, “Noble one, this is a subject that is difficult to
believe.”1067
22. 27
Sudhana said, “Āryā, please teach me. Through the power of the buddhas
and being in the care of the kalyāṇamitras, I will believe it, comprehend it,
know it, understand it, discern it, cognize it, reflect upon it as a focus of my
attention, contemplate it, not deny it, not conceptualize it, not add to it, and
be in accord with it.”
22. 28
Then the upāsikā Acalā said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble
one, in the past, during a kalpa called Stainless Light, appeared the tathāgata
named Pralambabāhu. At that time I was the only daughter
 of King
Vidyuddatta. One night when I was not sleeping,
 the door of the royal
residence
 was shut, my parents were asleep, the staff of men and women
had gone to sleep, the sound of music being played had ceased, and the five
hundred women that I spent time with were sleeping, I sat on my bed,
looking at the constellations of stars in the sky. In the sky above I saw the
Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Pralambabāhu, who was like Sumeru,
the lord of mountains. He was accompanied by an entourage of many nāgas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas. His body
spread a network of unimpeded light rays throughout all directions. From all
the pores of the tathāgata’s body came a beautiful scent [F.39.b] that brought
ease to my mind and body and great happiness to my mind.
1068
1069
1070
22. 29
“I arose from my bed and stood on the floor, and with my ten fingers
placed together in homage, I bowed down to the Tathāgata Pralambabāhu.
As I looked at the crown of his head there seemed to be no end to it, and I
could not grasp his extent to the right or left. I could never have enough of
contemplating his perfect signs and features of a great being.
22. 30
“At that time, I wondered, ‘Through what kind of karma can one obtain
such a perfect body? Give rise to the perfect signs and features of a great
bring? Have such a perfect display of light? Attain such a perfect entourage?
Have such a perfect residence and requisites that are of the nature of the
mind? Develop such a perfection of merit? Have such purified wisdom?
Attain such perfect, inconceivable miracles from samādhi? Complete such
perfect powers of retention? And have the power of such perfect eloquence?’


---

22. 31
“Noble one, the Bhagavat Tathāgata Pralambabāhu knew my thought and
said, ‘Girl, develop an invincible motivation for the defeat of all the kleśas.
Develop an undefeatable motivation for eliminating all attachment. Develop
an unwearying motivation for comprehending the way of the profound
Dharma. Develop an unshakable motivation for descending into the whirling
ocean of the range
 of the thoughts of beings. Develop an unconfused
motivation for the rebirth in all the states of existence within saṃsāra.
Develop a never-satisfied motivation for the continuous aspiration to see all
the buddhas. [F.40.a] Develop a never-satiated motivation in order to obtain
the clouds of Dharma of all the buddhas. Develop a realized motivation in
order to realize the light of the way of the Dharma of all the buddhas.
Develop an acquisitive motivation for acquiring the Dharma wheels of all the
buddhas. Develop a motivation to be without delusion concerning even a
small gesture, let alone to know that which comes from a tathāgata’s mouth.
Girl, you should develop the motivation to distribute the precious Dharma in
accordance with the aspirations of beings.’
1071
22. 32
“Noble one, I heard from the Bhagavat Tathāgata Arhat Samyak-
saṃbuddha Pralambabāhu, that king of the gateways of instruction to the
way of the Dharma, and I longed to attain omniscient wisdom. I aspired to
the nature of the strengths. I wished for the words of the Buddha. I wanted
to have the purified display of light of a buddha. I wanted to attain the
perfect body of a buddha. I longed to have a buddha’s pure signs and
features of a great being. I aspired to have the perfect assembly of followers
of a buddha. I wished for
 the pure realms of a buddha. I longed for the
perfect conduct of a buddha. I rejoiced in the perfect lifespan of a buddha. I
had developed the motivation that could not be impaired by all the kleśas or
by the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, which like a vajra could not be
defeated even by the strength of all mountains and weapons.
1072
22. 33
“Noble one, from that time until now, through the power of having
developed that motivation, throughout as many kalpas as there are atoms in
Jambudvīpa, [F.40.b] I do not remember
 ever in my mind enjoying
pleasures, let alone copulation.
1073
22. 34
“Noble one, from that time until now, I have never had one thought of
anger toward a kalyāṇamitra, let alone offended any other being.
22. 35
“Noble one, from that time until now, I do not remember having ever
given rise to a single thought that holds the view that there is a self, let alone
having attachment to things that I think of as being mine.
22. 36
“Even when I died and was reborn inside a womb, I do not remember
being in a state of stupidity, having various concepts, or having a neutral
state of mind, let alone having a state of mental fixation.


---

22. 37
“Throughout those kalpas I do not remember ever forgetting
 seeing a
buddha, even down to the perception of the sight of a buddha in a dream, let
alone the perception of the visual images of the ten levels of bodhisattvas.
1074
22. 38
“From that time until now, while holding the clouds of Dharma of all the
tathāgatas, I do not remember forgetting
 in my mind even a single word
or term of the Dharma, even down to a single syllable, let alone what has
emerged from the treasure of the mouths of the tathāgatas.
1075
22. 39
“From that time until now, while I drank and drank from the ocean of the
Dharma, I do not remember ever ignoring and not contemplating even any
words of the worldly Dharmas.
22. 40
“From that time until now, I do not remember not accomplishing the
samādhi of a single gateway to the ways of the Dharma from among the
ocean of the ways of the Dharma, even down to the ways of the knowledge
of worldly crafts.
22. 41
“From that time until now, while I held the wheels of Dharma of the
tathāgatas in order to guide beings, I do not remember leaving out a single
word or even a single syllable that was transmitted to me.
22. 42
“From that time until now, there is not a single prayer from the ocean of
the visions of buddhas that I have not accomplished in order to purify the
ocean of beings, even down to carrying out the prayer of a buddha who was
an emanation. [F.41.a]
22. 43
“From that time until now, I do not remember not practicing any
bodhisattva conduct from the ocean of the past bodhisattva conduct of the
ocean of buddhas in order to purify my conduct.
22. 44
“From that time until now, I do not remember creating a single motivation
that was focused on being a śrāvaka or a pratyeka buddha.
22. 45
“Noble one, from that time until now, throughout as many kalpas as there
are atoms in Jambudvīpa, I do not remember ever having given rise to
doubts, dualistic identification, conceptualized identification, variegated
identification, obdurate
 identification, identification as inferior,
 or
identification as appropriate or inappropriate concerning any single word or
syllable.
1076
1077
22. 46
“Noble one, since that time, I have never been separated from the
appearance of a buddha. I have never been separated from the buddha
bhagavats. I have never been separated from the bodhisattvas. I have never
been separated from the true kalyāṇamitras. I have never been separated
from hearing the prayers of the buddhas. I have never been separated from
hearing of the conduct of the bodhisattvas. I have never been separated from
hearing the way of the perfections of the bodhisattvas. I have never been
separated from hearing the way of the light of the wisdom of the level of the
bodhisattvas. I have never been separated from the attainment of hearing the


---

inexhaustible treasures and treasuries of the retentions and samādhis of the
bodhisattvas. I have never been separated from hearing of the
comprehension of and entry into the centerless and endless network of
world realms. I have never been separated from the attainment of hearing
the causes for the arising of the centerless and endless [F.41.b] realms of
beings. I have never been separated from the light of the wisdom of the
cessation of the domain of the network of the kleśas of all beings. I have
never been separated from the attainment of the wisdom of the causes that
give rise to the roots of merit of all beings. I have never been separated from
the manifestation of bodies in accordance with the aspirations of all beings. I
have never been separated from the pure domain of the speech that brings
knowledge to all beings.
22. 47
“Noble one, I have accomplished this gateway of the bodhisattva
liberation called the essence of the wisdom that is difficult to attain and the
gateway of the samādhi called the display of the tireless search for the Dharma; I
have reflected on the gateway to bodhisattva conduct with a firm
commitment; I have contemplated the gateway called the power of retention of
the level of the equality of all phenomena and the gateway called the light of the
wisdom of eloquence that elucidates the basis of all phenomena; and therefore
miraculous powers have arisen. Noble one, do you wish to see them?”
Sudhana answered, “I wish to do so.”
22. 48
The upāsikā Acalā viewed, analyzed, followed, and realized gateways of
bodhisattva liberations such as the essence of wisdom that is difficult to attain and
many millions of gateways of samādhis: gateways of samādhis such as the
display of the tireless search for the Dharma, samādhis such as the display of the
unfailing domain, samādhis such as facing the display of the domain of the wisdom
of the ten strengths, and samādhis such as the inexhaustible treasure of the buddha
family.
22. 49
As soon as the upāsikā Acalā rested in those samādhis, Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, saw world realms as numerous as the atoms in ten
anabhilāpya buddha realms in the ten directions shake in six ways, [F.42.a]
and he saw that they were formed of pure beryl. He saw in each world realm
a billion tathāgatas in a billion four-continent world realms. He saw some
dwelling in Tuṣita and so on, up to some passing away into nirvāṇa. He saw
that because those completely pure world realms of beryl were unobscured,
each of those tathāgatas pervaded the entire realm of phenomena with their
light rays and halos; each of those tathāgatas had their own ocean of
separate assemblies of followers; and each of those tathāgatas taught the
wheel of the entire Dharma, which was heard by all beings, who listened to
the domains of their speech.


---

22. 50
Then the upāsikā Acalā rose from that samādhi and said to Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, “Noble one, did you see that? Did you hear that? Did
you discern that?”
He answered “I saw it. I heard it. I discerned it.”
22. 51
The upāsikā Acalā said, “Noble one, I have trained in the gateway of the
bodhisattva conduct called possessing a strong commitment; I have rested in the
samādhi called the display of the tireless search for the Dharma; I have dwelled in
the gateway of bodhisattva liberations called the essence of the wisdom that is
difficult to attain; I have realized the power of retention of the level of the equality of
all phenomena; and through being skilled in describing the light of the wisdom of
eloquence that elucidates the basis of all phenomena, I have taught beings and
brought them satisfaction.
22. 52
“However, how could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who possess measureless, inconceivable qualities; whose
activity has no fixed location, like the lord of birds in the sky; who, like the
great lord of the garuḍas, [F.42.b] dive into the ocean of beings in order to
extract the ripened bodhisattvas; who, like merchants, go the island of the
jewels of omniscience, longing for the jewel that is the wisdom of the ten
strengths; who, like strong fishermen, go onto the ocean of saṃsāra
 with
the beautiful net of the domain of the wheel of the Dharma in their hands in
order to draw ripened beings out from the water of craving; who, like the
lord of the devas,
 move throughout the three realms, filling them in order
to repel and subjugate the attacks of the asuras of the kleśas; who, like the
disk of the sun, rise high in the sky of the realm of the Dharma in order to dry
the water of the craving of beings and the mud of the kleśas; who, like the
full moon, shine in the sky of wisdom in order to cause the night lotuses of
the minds of those to be guided to blossom; who, like the surface of the
Earth, support all equally without any distinction between those who are
friends and not friends, or those who are high and those who are low, in
order to cause the sprouts of the power of goodness in all beings to rise and
grow; who, like a tempest, move everywhere without impediment in order to
uproot the trees, vines, forests, and groves of the kleśas and false views of all
beings; who, like a cakravartin, act within the world in order to gather all
beings through conditions and requisites as methods of gathering pupils?
1078
1079
22. 53
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in a land called Amitatosala,
there is a town named Tosala. There dwells the parivrājaka by the name of
Sarvagamin. Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
22. 54
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
upāsikā Acalā, [F.43.a] circumambulated the upāsikā Acalā a hundred
thousand times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again,

departed from the presence of the upāsikā Acalā.

Chapter 23
SARVAGAMIN
23. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, visualizing in his mind the upāsikā
Acalā, remembering the instruction of the upāsikā Acalā, with conviction in
and no doubt about what the upāsikā Acalā had taught, proclaimed,
instructed, described,
 sanctioned, established, explicated, stated, and
elaborated upon it; he followed it, contemplated it, comprehended it,
meditated on it, was absorbed in it,
 was fixed upon it, understood it,
illuminated it, and became equal to it.
1080
1081
1082
23. 2
Eventually, traveling from district to district, going from land to land,
Sudhana arrived at the land called Amitatosala. He searched for the town
named Tosala, and at sunset he arrived at the town of Tosala. He entered the
town of Tosala and went to the crossroads in the center of the town. He
wandered from one street to another, from one crossroads to another, from
one lane to another, searching and inquiring. When it was night and people
were asleep, he saw to the north of the town of Tosala a hill called Sulabha.
Its summit was adorned by a delightful variety of grasses, bushes, and
herbs, and it shone as brightly as the sun. Seeing that light, he felt a powerful
joy and thought, “I will without doubt see the kalyāṇamitra on the summit of
that hill.” He came out of the town [F.43.b] and went to Sulabha Hill, and he
climbed up Sulabha Hill and arrived at the very bright summit of the hill. He
saw in the distance the parivrājaka Sarvagamin, who shone with splendor
and whose appearance was superior even to that of Mahābrahmā, and ten
thousand brahmins were walking in circumambulation around him.
23. 3
Sudhana approached him, bowed his head to his feet, circumambulated
him many hundreds of thousands of times, and sat down before him. With
his hands placed together in homage, he said, “Ārya, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
should practice it.


---

23. 4
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
23. 5
Sarvagamin said, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have in
that way set out upon the highest, complete enlightenment!
23. 6
“Noble one, I, Sarvagamin, remain within the all-pervading bodhisattva
conduct. I am endowed with the gateway of the samādhi called the light of the
practice of all gateways, with being established in the absence of existence, with
noncomposite miraculous powers, and with the gateway of the knowledge
of the perfection of wisdom that has reached the basis of the entire realm of
the Dharma.
23. 7
“Noble one, in that way I benefit beings in the entire array of worlds
inhabited by beings, in all the states of existences that beings are in, in all the
gateways of the deaths of beings, in all the gateways of the births of beings,
in all the different existences, in the various different abodes, and in the
worlds that are habitations —beings who have [F.44.a] various colors,
shapes, heights, and widths and who have entered various kinds of rebirths,
have different practices, and have different aspirations, which means those
within existence as a deva, those within existence as a nāga, those within
existence as a yakṣa, those within existence as a gandharva, those within
existence as an asura, those within existence as a garuḍa, those within
existence as a kinnara, those within existence as a mahoraga, those within
existence as a hell being, those within existence as an animal, those within
existence in the world of Yama, those within existence as a human, those
within existence as a nonhuman, those who have various false views, those
who aspire to the Śrāvakayāna, those who aspire to the Pratyeka-
buddhayāna, and those who aspire to the Mahāyāna —benefiting them
through various methods and through various introductions to the way of
wisdom.
23. 8
“This means that I benefit some beings with the light of the power of
mental retention
 that possesses all the knowledge of the various crafts so
that they will learn the various worldly crafts.
1083
23. 9
“I benefit some beings through the application of the four methods of
gathering pupils, which means leading them to omniscient wisdom.
“I benefit some beings by describing the perfections, thus generating the
light of the gateway
 of the wisdom that transforms into omniscience.
1084
23. 10
“I benefit some beings by describing the aspiration to enlightenment, thus
developing an imperishable, strengthened seed of enlightenment.
“I benefit some beings by describing all the aspects of bodhisattva
conduct, thus generating the aspiration to purify all buddha realms and
ripen all beings. [F.44.b]


---

23. 11
“I benefit some beings by causing dismay, by teaching the sufferings
experienced by beings in the hells caused by the ripening of their bad
conduct.
“I benefit some beings by causing delight, by describing all the qualities
that arise in the tathāgatas,
 which are the ultimate result of definite
omniscience.
1085
23. 12
“I benefit some beings by speaking praises of the qualities of all the
tathāgatas, thus generating the aspiration to omniscience and the longing
for the qualities and body of a buddha.
23. 13
“I benefit some beings by describing the greatness of the buddhas, thus
generating the longing to attain the body of a buddha that possesses the
power to undertake continuous, irresistible buddha activity.
23. 14
“I benefit some beings by describing the dominance of the buddhas, thus
generating the aspiration to attain the perfect body of a buddha, which
cannot be surpassed but surpasses all others.
23. 15
“Moreover, noble one, I manifest a body of the size and shape that accords
[F.45.a] with the aspirations, activities, powers, and conducts of all the men,
women, boys, and girls who are gathered in all the crossroads, streets,
junctions, side streets, houses, trades, districts, and dwellings in the districts
of this town of Tosala, and I teach them the Dharma. Those beings do not
know who has taught them or where he has come from, but otherwise
having heard me, they all practice correctly.1086
23. 16
“Moreover, noble one, I go everywhere in this Jambudvīpa in order to
ripen those who are attached to the ninety-six varieties of heretical
 views.
1087
23. 17
“Noble one, in the same way that I benefit beings in this town of Tosala, I
benefit beings in all the villages, markets,
 towns, lands, kingdoms, and
capitals in Jambudvīpa. In the same way that I benefit beings in Jambudvīpa,
I do so in the entire four-continent world realm, and in a thousand such
world realms, and in a million, and in the great world realms of a billion such
world realms. In the same way, I benefit beings according to their aspirations
in all the world realms in the ten directions, in all the habitations of beings, in
all the dwellings of beings, in all the locations of beings, in all that are
known as the abodes of beings, in all the residences of beings, in all the
congregations of beings, in all the oceans of beings, in all the lineages of
beings, in all the directions of beings, in all the intermediate directions of
beings, and in all the conducts of beings. I benefit beings through various
methods, various ways, various gateways, various kinds of logic, various
connections, various ways of methods, and various actions. I benefit beings
through the manifestation of various attractive physical forms and colors. I
benefit beings through speaking in various languages. [F.45.b]

“Noble one, in that way, I know this bodhisattva conduct that is all-
pervasive
 and omnipresent, but how could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of those bodhisattvas who possess bodies that are the
same as those of all beings; who have attained the samādhi called identical to
the bodies of all beings; who pervade all the classes of existence with a vast
wheel of emanations; who perform in their own bodies all worldly births;
who are dedicated to the wheel of beautiful emanations that all beings
delight to see; who manifest births in the families, clans, and lives of all
beings; who possess the unimpeded wheel of aspiration to dwell in all
kalpas; who have attained the radiance of the display of conduct that is like
an illusion; who are dedicated to benefiting all beings and yet remain
stainless; who have realized the equality of all the realms of beings in the
three times; who possess the essence of infinite compassion illuminated by
the realm of the wisdom of selflessness; and who are dedicated to
generating the roots of merit of all beings?

23. 19
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in a land called Pṛthurāṣṭra,
there dwells a perfume-seller head merchant by the name of Utpalabhūti. Go
to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
23. 20
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
parivrājaka Sarvagamin, circumambulated the parivrājaka Sarvagamin a
hundred thousand times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again
and again, departed from the presence of the parivrājaka Sarvagamin.

UTPALABHŪTI
24. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had no regard for his life or body; he had
no regard for engaging in dedication to obtaining and possessing the
pleasures of existence; [F.46.a] he had no regard for the objects of perception
that beings delight in; he had no regard for forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and
textures; he had no concern for enjoying retinues and pleasures; he had no
regard for any of the pleasures of the power of kingship and sovereignty; he
was focused on attaining the highest purification of a buddha realm for the
pure ripening and guiding of all beings; he was focused on never being
satisfied with the extent of his offering to, honoring, and serving all the
tathāgatas; he was focused on all phenomena with the wisdom that knows
their nature;
 he was focused on the qualities of bodhisattvas so that there
would be no decline in his practice, which had the entire ocean of those
qualities as its goal; he was focused on the great prayers of all bodhisattvas
so as to maintain bodhisattva conduct throughout all kalpas; he was focused
on entering the ocean of the circles of the followers of all tathāgatas; he was
focused on all gateways of bodhisattva samādhis so as to manifest the
attainment of all countless bodhisattva samādhis through each samādhi
gateway; he was focused on all the light of wisdom of all Dharma wheels so
as to never be satisfied with the extent of his obtaining Dharma wheels from
all the tathāgatas; and he was focused on the kalyāṇamitras, who are the
source of qualities, because the kalyāṇamitras are the source of the qualities
of the buddhas, the bodhisattvas, and others.
1090
24. 2
Sudhana eventually arrived at the land called Pṛthurāṣṭra. He looked and
searched for the perfume-seller head merchant by the name of Utpalabhūti.
He saw the perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti and approached him.
[F.46.b] After approaching him, Sudhana bowed his head to the perfume-
seller head merchant Utpalabhūti’s feet, circumambulated the perfume-seller
head merchant Utpalabhūti many hundreds of thousands of times, and sat

down before the perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti. With his hands
placed together in homage, he said, “Ārya, I seek the wisdom that is the
same as that of all the buddhas. I rejoice in the fulfillment of the field of
prayers made in the past by all the buddhas, I rejoice in the accomplishment
of the Dharma body of all the buddhas, I seek the wisdom body of all the
buddhas, I rejoice in the purification of all the fields of bodhisattva conduct, I
rejoice in the light of all the fields of bodhisattva samādhis, I rejoice in the
stability of all the fields of the bodhisattva power of mental retention, I
rejoice in the dispelling of the entire field of kleśas, I seek to travel in all the
fields of the realms, and I have set out upon the highest complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it, and how through
having practiced in that way all bodhisattvas become omniscient.”
24. 3
Utpalabhūti said to him, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you
have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.
24. 4
“Noble one, I know all perfumes. I know about all combined perfumes, all
incenses, all combinations of perfumes and incenses, all ointments, all
combined ointments, all powders, all combinations of powders, and all
perfumes, ointments, and powders. [F.47.a]
24. 5
I know the perfumes of the devas. I also know the perfumes of the nāgas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and
nonhumans.
24. 6
“I know the perfumes that heal sickness. I also know the perfumes that
dispel unhappiness, the perfumes that give rise to worldly happiness, the
perfumes that cause the kleśas to blaze, the perfumes that cause kleśas to
cease, the perfumes that create various kinds of composite happiness and
bliss, the perfumes that create composite sadness, the perfumes that dispel
all intoxication and carelessness,
 the perfumes that accomplish a
continuous focus on the buddhas, the perfumes of understanding the way of
the Dharma, the perfumes of ārya conduct, the various bodhisattva
perfumes, and the perfumes of being established on all the bodhisattva
levels. I know the aspects of all those perfumes. I also know their origin,
creation, accomplishment, perfection, purification, elimination, combination,
usage, object, power, action, and cause.
1091
24. 7
“Noble one, in the world there is the perfume called elephant essence that
disconcerts the nāgas.
 A pellet merely the size of a sesame seed will
pervade the entire land of Pṛthurāṣṭra with a thick net of a cloud of perfume.
For seven days there will fall a fine rain of scented water. At that time, when
that scented water falls on any being’s body or clothing, all their bodies and
clothing will become adorned with golden flowers. [F.47.b]
 Those beings
who are indoors and smell the scent that is brought in by the breeze from
1092
1093

that net of clouds of perfume will all have increased happiness and
aspiration for seven days and will experience various kinds of mental and
physical happiness and pleasure, and they will have no illness that is caused
by the disturbance of the elements in their bodies or is the result of harm
caused by others. They will have no suffering or unhappiness. They will
have no fear, no terror, no apprehension, no disturbance of mind, and no
malice. For seven days there will arise happiness and joy, and they will be
kind to one another.
24. 8
“Noble one, in order to purify the thoughts of those who are experiencing
happiness and joy, I teach them the Dharma so that they will definitely have
the highest, complete enlightenment.
24. 9
“Moreover, noble one, there is sandalwood called gośīrṣa that comes from
the Malaya mountains. If you rub it on your body, you can jump into a great
fire and you will not be burned.
24. 10
“Noble one, there is a perfume called invincible that comes from the ends of
the ocean. If you rub it on a drum or a horn, its sound will defeat all the
followers of others.
24. 11
“Noble one, there is the black agarwood called lotus essence that comes
from Lake Anavatapta. The smell from a pellet the size of a sesame seed will
fill all of Jambudvīpa. Every being that smells that perfume will renounce
bad actions and gain a controlled mind.
24. 12
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called luminescent that comes from
the Himalaya, the king of mountains. If one smells its scent, the mind will
become freed from desire. I teach them the Dharma so that they will attain
the samādhi called the stainless field. [F.48.a]
24. 13
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called the essence of the sea that comes
from the land of the rākṣasas and has been produced for the enjoyment of a
cakravartin king. As soon as he is perfumed by it, the cakravartin’s
fourfold
 army appears in the sky.
1094
24. 14
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called array of beauty
 that comes
from Sudharma, the assembly hall of the devas. As soon as the devas are
perfumed by it, they gain the memory of the pleasant aroma of the buddhas.
1095
24. 15
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called pure treasure in the paradise of
Suyāma, the king of devas. As soon as they are perfumed by it, all Suyāma’s
devas come before deva king Suyāma, and when they are in his presence,
the deva king Suyāma talks to them about the Dharma.
24. 16
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called chaste tree in Tuṣita. When its
aroma reaches bodhisattvas with one life remaining and who are upon their
Dharma seats, a great cloud of perfume fills the entire realm of phenomena,
and from great Dharma clouds that have a variety of adornments a rain falls
onto all the circles of followers of the tathāgatas.

24. 17
“Noble one, there is a kind of perfume called captivating in the paradise of
the deva king Sunirmita. When there is that aroma in the paradise of the
deva king Sunirmita, there falls an inconceivable rain from clouds of Dharma
for seven days.
24. 18
“Noble one, I know how to combine perfumes, but how could I know the
conduct or describe the qualities of those bodhisattvas who have no stain of
faults and have transcended the entire realm of desire, who are free from the
noose of the māra of the kleśas, who have transcended all the continuums of
the states of existence, who perform conduct with bodies and the aspect of
the illusion of wisdom, who are unstained by any world, [F.48.b] who have
the state of being without desire, who have the pure field of wisdom that is
unobscured, who have the range and scope of unimpeded wisdom, who do
not dwell in any basis or location, and who know the conduct of those who
move in all the bases and locations of existence? How could I elucidate the
gateway of their pure practice of correct conduct? How could I describe their
faultless conduct? How could I teach their continuum of body, speech, and
mind that is devoid of harmful conduct?
24. 19
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, there is a town named
Kūṭāgāra. There dwells a mariner by the name of Vaira. Go to him and ask
him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
24. 20
“Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
the perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti, circumambulated the
perfume-seller head merchant Utpalabhūti a hundred thousand times,
keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed from

VAIRA
25. 1
When Sudhana set out on the path to Kūṭāgāra, he observed and
contemplated how the path could be upward or downward, even or
uneven,
 dusty or free of dust, safe or hazardous,
 difficult or
unobstructed, and crooked or straight. He thought, “This journey to a
kalyāṇamitra will be a cause for the practice of the bodhisattva path, will be a
cause of the practice of the path of the perfections, and will be a cause of the
path of benefiting all beings,
 which will be a cause for turning all beings
away from the precipice of attachment
 and aversion, [F.49.a] of elation
and depression;
 will be a cause for turning all beings away from a
perception
 of inequality; will be a cause for removing the dust of the
kleśas from all beings; will be a cause for clearing away the tree trunks,
thorns, pebbles, and gravel of the various bad views of all beings; and,
through their entering the unobscured realm of the Dharma, will be a cause
for bringing them without hindrance to the palace of omniscience.
1096
1097
1098
1099
1100
1101
25. 2
“Why is that? Because the kalyāṇamitras are the source of all good
Dharmas, and the attainment of omniscience is dependent on the
kalyāṇamitras.”
25. 3
With his mind focused on those thoughts, and undergoing a difficult
journey, he eventually arrived at the city of Kūṭāgāra. He looked and
searched for the mariner Vaira and saw him at the shore of the ocean in front
of the gate of the great city. He was encircled by a hundred thousand
merchants and many hundreds of thousands of people who all wished to
listen to his various tales. As he told them tales of the sea, he was teaching
the beings about the ocean of qualities of the buddhas.
25. 4
When Sudhana saw the mariner Vaira, he approached him. Having
approached him, Sudhana bowed his head to the mariner Vaira’s feet,
circumambulated the mariner Vaira many hundreds of thousands of times,
and sat down before the mariner Vaira. With his hands placed together in

homage, he said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it. Ārya, I have
heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! [F.49.b] I pray
that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct
and how they should practice it!”
25. 5
Vaira said, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, that you have asked
about the cause of
 great wisdom, the cause of the continuity of the
various sufferings of saṃsāra, the cause of journeying to the island of
omniscience, the cause of the indivisible Mahāyāna, the cause of the practice
of the path that is free from the fear of falling down to the level of the
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, the cause of the path of knowledge that
comprehends engaging in the gateways of various
 samādhis of peace,
the cause of the pure
 and unimpeded path of the wheels of the chariot of
the aspiration to the practice of all-pervasive bodhisattva conduct, the cause
of the pure path of the way that is the nature of the display of all the majestic
waves of bodhisattva conduct, the cause of the pure ultimate path of all the
aspects and gateways of the Dharma, and the cause that gives rise to the
pure path for entering the ocean of omniscience.

25. 6
“Noble one, I dwell at the city of Kūṭāgāra on the seashore, purifying the
bodhisattva conduct called the banner of great compassion.
25. 7
“Noble one, when I see destitute beings in Jambudvīpa, I undergo
hardships for their sake, which means I will fulfill all their wishes. I will
collect worldly goods for them. I will satisfy them with the enjoyment of the
Dharma. I will teach them the instructions for the path of the accumulation of
merit. I will cause them to increase their accumulation of wisdom. [F.50.a] I
will increase the power of their roots of merit. I will cause them to develop
the aspiration for enlightenment. I will purify their aspiration for
enlightenment. I will cause them to have the enduring strength of great
compassion. I will cause the suffering of saṃsāra to cease. I will cause them
to have an enduring strength for tireless conduct in saṃsāra. I will provide
these to the gathering of an ocean of beings. I will bring them into the
gateways of the practice of an ocean of qualities. I will cause them to obtain
the light of the wisdom of the ocean of the Dharma. I will cause them to
see
 the entire ocean of buddhas. I will cause them to enter the ocean of
omniscience.

“Noble one,
 it is with such an aspiration and intention that I dwell in
the city of Kūṭāgāra on the seashore.

how to turn a ship around,
 how to anchor a ship, and how to launch a
ship.

25. 12
“Noble one, with that kind of knowledge I am constantly dedicated to
necessary benefits
 for beings: I bring a group of merchants, just as they
wish, to the island of jewels safely,
 peacefully,
 without fear, and in a

“Noble one, no ship of mine has ever been in distress.
 Any being who
sees me and any being who hears me teach the Dharma becomes free from

the wisdom of entering the ocean of omniscience. They become dedicated to
drying up the ocean of craving, attain the light of the knowledge of the
ocean of the three times, and make the aspiration to eliminate the ocean of
the suffering of all beings. They become dedicated to purifying away the
pollution in the ocean of the minds of all beings. They become dedicated to
purifying the ocean of all realms. They never turn back from spreading
throughout the ocean of all directions. They comprehend the ocean of the
different capabilities of all beings. They follow the ocean of the conducts of

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was overjoyed, pleased, happy,

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, whose mind spread great love
throughout the immeasurable realm of beings; whose being was saturated
with the tenderness
 of great compassion; who had accumulated a vast
array of the accumulations of merit and wisdom; who had become free of all
the dust, darkness, dirt, and mire of the kleśas; who had realized the equality
of all phenomena; [F.51.b] who was devoted to the path that leads
upward to omniscience; who had chosen
 the gateway for entering into
immeasurable good qualities; who had the exertion
 of firm diligence that
is unimpaired by any bad quality; who was filled
 with the vast

 of inconceivable bodhisattva samādhis; who shone with the
light of the sun of wisdom that eliminated all the darkness of ignorance; who
scattered flowers of wisdom brought by the pleasant, cool breezes of
methods; who followed the way of wisdom that emerged from an ocean of

He arrived at the town called Nandihāra and looked and searched for the
head merchant Jayottama. He saw him on the eastern edge of the town of
Nandihāra, in a forest of ashoka trees that was called Vicitra dhvaja. He was
encircled by many thousands of householders deciding
 upon various
kinds of civic duties, and in reference to those he talked about the Dharma.
He was teaching the Dharma for the sake of eliminating all egotism;
abandoning all possessiveness;
 rejecting all attachment; forsaking all
fixation on things; destroying all clinging; cutting through all the bondage of
craving; breaking down the doors of all views; clearing away the darkness of
doubt, uncertainty, and equivocation; cleansing away the dirt of illusion and
deceit; purifying the stains of envy and miserliness; clarifying the lake of the

unpolluted faith; [F.52.a] giving rise to the aspiration to see the buddhas;
eulogizing the power of bodhisattvas; receiving the Dharma of the buddhas;
aspiring to bodhisattva conduct; giving rise to the power of bodhisattva
samādhi; teaching the power of bodhisattva wisdom; and attaining the
highest purity of the power of bodhisattva memory.
This means that he was teaching the Dharma in order to inspire the
aspiration to enlightenment.
26. 3
Then when the teaching was concluded, Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, approached and bowed his head to the feet of the head merchant
Jayottama. He bowed down to him for a long time and said, “Ārya, I am
Sudhana, I am Sudhana! I seek bodhisattva conduct. Instruct me, Ārya, on
how I should train in bodhisattva conduct and while training how I should
aspire to guide and ripen all beings,
 not forsake seeing all the buddhas,
hear the Dharma of all the buddhas, possess the rain
 from the clouds of

speech, avariciousness, maliciousness, and wrong views. I turn beings away
from all that should not be done and make them engage in all virtuous
Dharma activity, and I make all beings train in all skills. I teach, prepare,
elucidate, and present all the treatises that are beneficial to the world, so as
to bring happiness to the world, to ripen beings, to follow false doctrines
in order to describe the special higher wisdom, to dispel all wrong views,
and to describe and teach all the Buddhadharma. I overwhelm and teach the

have the mastery of the power of the wisdom that includes all phenomena;
who possess beautiful, fine tongues that are endowed with a domain of
speech that is directed separately, according to their aspirations, to
inconceivable, immeasurable beings; who have bodies that are like illusions
and equal to all bodhisattvas, with complexions and forms that accord with
the various wishes of an ocean of beings; who possess inconceivable bodies
that have a conduct no different from that of all the tathāgatas; who have
bodies of wisdom that follow all three times; and who have a scope and field
of conduct that is as immeasurable and vast as the expanse of space?

“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land called
Śroṇāparānta, there is a city by the name of Kaliṅgavana where dwells a
bhikṣuṇī by the name of Siṃha vijṛmbhitā. Go to her and ask her, ‘How
should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
26. 11
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
head merchant Jayottama, [F.54.b] circumambulated the head merchant
Jayottama many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right,
and, looking back again and again, departed from the head merchant
Jayottama.

Chapter 27
SIṂHA VIJṚMBHITĀ
27. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, set out for the town of Kaliṅgavana in
the land of Śroṇāparānta and then arrived there. Searching for the bhikṣuṇī
Siṃha vijṛmbhitā, as he roamed here and there he questioned the people he
met. There were many hundreds of young men
 and many hundreds of
young women assembling and following in the streets, crossroads, and
street junctions, together with many hundreds of men and many hundreds
of women.
1154
27. 2
They said, “Noble one, the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā is in this town of
Kaliṅgavana, sitting in the great park called Sūrya prabha donated by
Jayaprabha, where she is teaching the Dharma for the sake of countless
beings.”
27. 3
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went to Sūrya prabha Park.
Walking around it and looking about, he saw in the park many trees called
candrodgata that had the shape of kūṭāgāras, had various colors of light, and
shone with light, illuminating everywhere around up to a yojana. He saw
many leafy trees called saṃpracchada that had the shape of a parasol, and
their leaves covered everywhere, like shining clouds the color of blue beryl.
He saw many blossoming trees called kusuma kośa that had the varied
beautiful shape of the Himalaya, king of mountains, and from which fell
unceasing flows of a rain of flowers of various colors; they were an
accumulation of all the adornments of the Trāyastriṃśa palace
 and could
not be destroyed by anyone.
 He saw many fruit trees called anupama-
svādu phala nicita, which had the form of gold mountain peaks
 and always
had perfect fruit that was always ripe. [F.55.a] He saw many trees of kings of
jewels called vairocanakośa that had the shapes of incomparable kings of
jewels and possessed perfect divine strings of jewels, necklaces, and
precious adornments that seemed to have come from the treasury of the
kings of wish-fulfilling jewels and were the source of jewels of countless

colors. He saw many cloth trees called prasādana, which were adorned by
being strewn and hung with precious divine cloths of various colors. He saw
many music trees called pramodana, which emitted the sounds of beautiful
music from instruments superior to those of the devas. He saw many
perfume trees called samanta śubha vyūha, from which arose pleasing perfumes
of every kind of pleasant aroma spreading freely in all directions. There were
springs, ponds, reservoirs, and pools that had balustrades made of the seven
precious materials around them, with precious steps on all four sides,
encircled by precious platforms perfumed with the pleasant aroma of yellow
sandalwood, with perfectly laid bottoms made of precious blue beryl, the
king of jewels, and which were spread with the sand of Jambu River gold
and filled with aromatic divine water that had the eight qualities. Their
waters were covered with the various colors and divine scents of precious
lotuses, blue lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses; were filled with flocks
of various birds, with beauty that transcended the divine, emitting beautiful
sounds; and were beautified by being encircled with radiant trees made of
various divine jewels. Arranged at the feet of all those trees of various
jewels
 were precious lion thrones, with various beautiful forms, arrayed
in inconceivable adornments of various jewels, [F.55.b] adorned and spread
with divine precious cushions,
 perfumed by all kinds of scents and
incenses, hung with precious, beyond-divine ribbons, canopied by canopies
of various jewels, covered by nets
 of Jambu River gold and various
jewels, adorned by many
 precious beautiful nets of bells that emitted
beautiful sounds, and accompanied by many hundreds of thousands
 of
seats made of divine jewels.

He saw, arranged at the feet of some jewel trees, lion thrones with lotuses
in their centers that were made of jewels; at the feet of some, lion thrones
with lotuses in their centers that were made of the precious jewel king of
perfumes; at the feet of some, lion thrones with lotuses in their centers that
were made of the king of jewels array of nāgas; at the feet of some, lion thrones
with lotuses in their centers that were made of the king of precious jewels
lion’s trunk;
 at the feet of some, lion thrones with lotuses in their centers
that were made of the king of precious jewels the sun; at the feet of some, lion
thrones with lotuses in their centers that were made of the king of precious
jewels radiance; at the feet of some, lion thrones with lotuses in their centers
that were made of the king of precious jewels Indra’s vajra; at the feet of some,
lion thrones with lotuses in their centers that were made of the king of
precious jewels beauty of the world; and he saw, arranged at the feet of some
jewel trees, lion thrones with lotuses in their centers that were made of the
king of precious jewels white light.
1163

27. 5
He saw that the entire ground of that great park was covered with various
jewels like an ocean covered by islands of jewels.
27. 6
He saw that the land was beautified by blue beryl dust,
 was adorned
with various jewels, and was as pleasant and soft
 to the touch as down; it
sank as one stepped on it and rose as one lifted the foot;
 [F.56.a] its
surface was strewn with the petals
 of beautifully aromatic lotuses that
were pleasant to the touch and made of diamond jewels; it was filled with
ruddy shelducks,
 peacocks, cranes, snipes, avadavats, cuckoos,
 and
partridges that emitted beautiful sounds; it was adorned by perfectly formed
forests of many divine, precious sandalwood trees; there was a continuous
rainfall from clouds of lotuses made of various jewels and a rain of various
precious flowers; it was superior to Miśrakavana; there were kūṭāgāras made
of various jewels arrayed as adornments from within which constantly
emanated the unequaled
 aromas of the kings of perfumes; it was a
display superior to that of Sudharma, the meeting hall of the devas; they
were covered with nets of various jewels that were superior to divine jewels;
they were adorned by hanging bundles of pearls, jewels, and flowers;
they were entirely adorned by shining gold nets arrayed with a variety of
precious bells.
1164
1165
1166
1167
1168
1169
1170
1171
27. 7
Beautiful and pleasant music came from trees with a variety
 of musical
instruments, precious palm trees, and nets of bells when they were stirred by
the breeze. There arose the perfectly delightful sound of songs like those of
the apsarases of the king of the Vaśavartin devas. The park was beautified
by a rain that fell from clouds of divine cloths, of various colors, that fulfilled
all wishes. It resembled a vast ocean with a variety
 of colors and lusters
so that one could not stop looking at it. It was adorned by countless
hundreds of thousands of kūṭāgāras adorned with jewels.
 It was as
beautiful to behold as the residence
 of Indra
 in Trāyastriṃśa.
 It
was adorned by an array of various jewels of every kind. There was the
beautiful sight of an array of perfectly formed parasols standing erect. It was
made beautiful by various pinnacles,
 like the realm of great Indra. [F.56.b]
There shone constantly a great beautiful radiance of light. Like the divine
palace of Mahābrahmā, it was radiant with the light of the kings of jewels
that brought delight to beings.
1172
1173
1174
1175
1176
1177
1178
27. 8
That great park called Sūrya prabha, through the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha-
vijṛmbhitā’s great, inconceivable, miraculous abilities and attainment of
power,
 was as vast, immense, and extensive as the expanse of the sky
over countless world realms.
1179
27. 9
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw in that way the displays in the
park of aggregations of measureless, inconceivable qualities, which were
accomplished through the ripening of a bodhisattva’s karma; which were


---

born from vast, transcendent roots of merit that appeared as the natural
result of inconceivable offering and service to buddhas; which all the roots of
merit without exception in all worlds could not surpass; which were present
as the illusory nature of phenomena; which originated from the ripening of
the merit of vast, stainless virtue; which originated from the strength and
power that is the natural result of the conduct perfectly accomplished in the
past by the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā; which could not be surpassed by all
the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas; which could not be destroyed by
tīrthikas and opponents; which could not be harmed
 by any of the
activities of the path of the māras; and which could not be seen at all
 by
ordinary, foolish beings.
1180
1181
27. 10
He saw seated upon lion thrones at the feet of all those various precious
trees the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā surrounded by a great assembly.
 She
had a beautiful body, the peaceful conduct of a mendicant,
 pacified
senses,
 and a peaceful mind; she was perfectly self-controlled
 and had
conquered her senses; she was as perfectly tamed as an elephant; her mind
was as pure, clear, and unsullied as a lake; she fulfilled all wishes like a king
of wish-fulfilling jewels; [F.57.a] she was as unstained by worldly concerns
as a lotus by water; she was as free of fear and trepidation as a lion; because
of her perfectly pure confidence she was as unshakable as the great king of
mountains; because of her pure discipline she brought delight to beings like
the king of entrancing perfumes; like Himalayan sandalwood, she
extinguished the burning of the kleśas; like the beautiful king of herbs, she
brought an end to the sufferings of all beings; like the noose of Varuṇa, she
was a beneficial sight;
 like the light from a tathāgata, she brought peace
and happiness to body and mind; like Mahābrahmā, she was free from the
arising of anger, desire, and ignorance; like the king of jewels that purifies
water, she brought delight to the minds of beings that were turbid with
kleśas; and like a fertile land, she multiplied the roots of merit. On the
surrounding seats a diverse assembly was seated.

seats.

27. 41
Similarly, he saw the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā teaching the Dharma to
classes of beings —those categorized as beings, who had different kinds of
births and states, beings who had been ripened, had correct behavior, and
were worthy recipients and who had various motivations, various
aspirations, constant motivations,
 and the strong elixir
 of faith —who
had come into this great park and were seated upon separate assembly
seats, teaching them the Dharma that would make them firmly established in
wishing to attain the highest, complete enlightenment.
1195
1196
27. 42
What was the cause of this? The bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā had practiced
countless hundreds of thousands of gateways to the perfection of wisdom
such as the complete sight of equanimity, the teaching of all the Dharmas of the
buddhas, the different bases of the realm of phenomena, the destruction of all the
domains of obscuration, the arising of the virtuous mind in all beings, the exceptional
display, the essence of the way of nonattachment, the domain of the nature of
phenomena, the treasure of the mind, and the essence of the complete attainment of
one’s aspirations.
27. 43
All those bodhisattvas and other beings who came to the great Sūrya-
prabha Park in order to see the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā and listen to the
Dharma had in the past been established by the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā in
the accomplishment of the roots of merit and set on irreversible progress
toward the highest, complete enlightenment. [F.60.a]


---

27. 44
In that way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha-
vijṛmbhitā’s perfect park, perfect forest,
 perfect vihāra, perfect walkway,
perfect enjoyments, perfect seat, perfect assembly, perfect supremacy,
perfect miraculous manifestations, and perfect display of eloquence. He
heard her inconceivable way of the Dharma. His mind was saturated by a
vast cloud of Dharma, and with perfect motivation toward
 the bhikṣuṇī
Siṃha vijṛmbhitā he thought, “I shall circumambulate her to my right many
hundreds of thousands of times.” In that instant, the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha-
vijṛmbhitā filled the entire park and the assembly with light. He
circumambulated her many hundreds of thousands of times
 and thought,
“As I circumambulated, the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā was always seated
before me.”
1197
1198
1199
27. 45
With his hands together in homage he stood before her and said, “Āryā, I
have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I
do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in
what way they should practice it. Āryā, I have heard that you give
instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and how they should
practice it!”
27. 46
She said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
eradication of all conceit.” [F.60.b]
27. 47
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is the scope of that bodhisattva liberation
called the eradication of all conceit?”
She replied, “Noble one, it is the light of wisdom; it has the nature of
perceiving in a fraction of an instant of mind the displays that occur in the
three times.”
27. 48
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is the scope of that light of wisdom?”
She replied, “Noble one, when I had striven for and accomplished
 this
light of wisdom,
 there arose the samādhi called accordance with all
Dharmas.
 With the attainment of that samādhi, I go in bodies that are
made of mind to the bodhisattvas with one life remaining who reside in
Tuṣita palaces in all the world realms in all ten directions, so that with bodies
as numerous as the atoms in an inexpressible number of buddha realms I can
engage in making offerings to each bodhisattva with offerings that are as
numerous as the atoms in an inexpressible number of buddha realms. This
means I go as the bodies of lords of devas and as the bodies of nāgas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and
nonhumans, holding clouds of flowers, holding clouds of perfumes, holding
clouds of incense, holding clouds of garlands, holding clouds of ointments,
holding clouds of powders, holding clouds of clothing, holding clouds of
parasols, holding clouds of banners, holding clouds of flags, holding clouds
1200
1201
1202

of jewel ornamentations, holding clouds of arrays of nets of jewels, holding
clouds of arrays of bejeweled canopies, [F.61.a] holding clouds of arrays of
spread-out jewels,
 holding clouds of arrays of bejeweled lamps, and
holding clouds of arrays of bejeweled seats so as to engage in making
offerings.
1203
27. 49
“In the same way that I go to the bodhisattvas with one life remaining
who reside in Tuṣita so as to engage in making offerings, I go in bodies that
are made of mind and in such forms engage in offerings to all the tathāgatas
who have entered the bodies of their mothers, who are born, who reside
within harems, who have gone forth into homelessness, who are going to
the bodhimaṇḍa, who are present at the bodhimaṇḍa, who have attained the
highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood, who turn the wheel of the
Dharma, and who are entering nirvāṇa having satisfied the minds and
wishes of those who reside in the dwellings of the devas and those who
reside in the dwellings of the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans and in the dwellings of all
beings.
27. 50
“Those beings who know my offerings and service to the buddhas will all
definitely attain the highest, complete enlightenment.
27. 51
“I give the instructions on the teachings of the perfection of wisdom to all
those beings who come to me.
27. 52
“Noble one, I look upon all beings with wisdom eyes, but I do not give rise
to the concept of ‘beings,’ and I do not become conceited. I listen to the
ocean of the languages of all beings but do not become attached to any way
of speaking, and I do not become conceited. I also see all the tathāgatas, but
through knowing the body of [F.61.b] the Dharma, I do not become
conceited. I possess the Dharma wheels of all the tathāgatas, but because I
have realized the nature of phenomena, I do not become conceited. In each
instant of mind I permeate the entire realm of phenomena, but because I
have realized the illusory nature of phenomena, I do not become conceited.
27. 53
“Noble one, I know this bodhisattva liberation called the eradication of all
conceit, but how could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who have comprehended the endless and centerless realm of
phenomena, who remain without conceit within all phenomena, who sitting
cross-legged alone pervade the entire realm of phenomena, who reveal all
buddha realms contained within their bodies, who in a single instant come
into the presence of all the tathāgatas, within whose bodies all the miracles
of the buddhas take place, who manifest and introduce within a single pore-
hair an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms, who manifest in their pores
the kalpas of the creation and destruction of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of


---

countless world realms, who in one instant enter into the equality of
dwelling in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of kalpas, and who in one instant move
through an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of kalpas?
27. 54
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land called Durga, in the
city called Ratnavyūha, dwells a courtesan by the name of Vasumitrā. Go to
her and ask her, [F.62.a] ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva
conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
27. 55
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā, circumambulated the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā
many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking
back again and again, departed from the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā.

 of the bodhisattvas, eventually arrived at the city of Ratnavyūha
in the land of Durga and searched for the courtesan Vasumitrā.
1204
1205
28. 2
The people there who did not know the qualities of the courtesan
Vasumitrā [F.62.b] and lacked the knowledge of the scope of wisdom
thought, “What does such a man —who has pacified and controlled senses,
who is mindful, who is unconfused, whose mind is not agitated, who keeps
his gaze the length of a yoke before him, whose mind is not overcome by
sensations, who is not fixated on external features, whose eyes are
averted
 from dwelling on any physical form, whose mind is free of
preoccupations, who is wise,
 who is like an ocean, whose mind is
unshakable and without weakness —want with the courtesan Vasumitrā?
Someone like this does not delight in sensual pleasures, and so his mind
cannot possibly go astray. Someone like this does not engage in impure
thoughts. It is not possible that someone like this would be a slave to desire.
Someone like this does not fall under the power of a woman. It is not
1206
1207
1208


---

possible that someone like this is engaged in the field of conduct of the
māras. Someone like this does not dwell in the field of conduct of the māras.
It is not possible that someone like this is sinking into the mud of desire.
Someone like this is not bound by the noose of the māras. He is not someone
who would do what should not be done.”
28. 3
Those who did know the special qualities of the courtesan Vasumitrā and
directly perceived wisdom’s range of conduct said to him, “It is excellent,
excellent, noble one, that you intend to ask questions of the courtesan
Vasumitrā; you have perfectly obtained a good outcome. You are certainly
aspiring to buddhahood. You are certainly wishing to become a refuge
for all beings. You are certainly wishing to remove from all beings the pain of
desire. You are certainly wishing to dispel conceptions of beauty and purity.
[F.63.a]
1209
28. 4
“Noble one, the courtesan Vasumitrā is in her home, which is on the north
side of the city’s junction of three streets.”
28. 5
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, on hearing those words, was filled
with joy, delighted, elated, pleased, and happy. He went to the home of the
courtesan Vasumitrā. He saw that her house was huge and vast and
surrounded by ten successive precious walls. It was encircled by ten
successive rows of precious palm trees. It was encircled by ten successive
moats filled with water and covered with divine, precious red lotuses, blue
lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses; they were filled with water that
possessed the eight good qualities; they had bottoms that were covered with
gold dust; they were filled with aromatic water mixed with beautiful scents;
and they were adorned by numerous precious fences.1210
28. 6
He saw well-arranged buildings, palaces, kūṭāgāras made from every
jewel with high
 pinnacles, toraṇas, round windows, lattices, crescents,
pavilions, shining banners, and so on, brilliant with various jewels. Her
house was beautified by walls
 of countless various jewels. Its floor was
formed of jewels inlaid with beryls. Its environs were perfumed by every
aromatic divine incense. It was perfumed by the aroma of supreme black
agarwood incense. Its environs were anointed with unguents. Rooftop
railings made of various jewels adorned the walls. It was covered above by
nets of Jambu River gold inlaid with various jewels. A hundred thousand
networks of hundreds of golden bells were ringing as they were moved by
the breeze, emitting a pleasant, beautiful sound. It was adorned by precious
flowers scattered and dispersed
 from clouds of flowers made from every
jewel. [F.63.b] The gateways were adorned by erected multicolored
banners made of all precious materials. The light from the brilliant shining of
1211
1212
1213
1214

various precious jewels shone outward without limit. There was an endless
treasure of a perfect multitude
 of hundreds of thousands of precious trees
of coral, diamonds, crystal, and so on,
 and it was beautified by ten parks.
1215
1216
28. 7
Sudhana saw there the courtesan Vasumitrā, who was beautiful, attractive,
and delightful to see. She was endowed with a magnificent, perfect color.
She had golden skin and deep black
 hair. Her limbs and smaller features
were all perfectly formed. She had a beautiful color, form, and shape that
were superior to those of all humans and devas of the desire realm. The
aspects of her voice were superior to those of Brahmā. She was skilled in the
languages of all beings. She had a beautiful voice that had the array of all
sounds.
 She possessed the skill of the liberation called the array of the wheel
of words. She had become skilled in all arts and treatises. She had trained to
become wise in illusions through Dharma wisdom. She had attained all the
methods and ways of the bodhisattvas. She had a beautiful body adorned by
various kinds of precious jewelry. Her body was adorned by a brightly
shining network of all jewels. Her body shone brightly, being adorned by an
array of jewelry made of countless divine precious jewels. She wore tied
upon her head a king of wish-fulfilling, supreme, precious jewels. She wore
at her throat a string of beryl jewels with its middle adorned by diamonds, a
multicolored beautiful lion, and precious jewels. [F.64.a]
1217
1218
28. 8
She had a beautiful assembly of followers that could not be divided, that
had a single aspiration and a similar share of the practice of the roots of
merit.
28. 9
She possessed an inexhaustible treasury of the treasure of the great
accumulations of merit and wisdom.
28. 10
Sudhana saw that all those buildings, the entire array of precious
dwellings and palaces, were illuminated and made bright by the light that
came from her body, which caused delight, physical pleasure and bliss, and
joy and happiness in the mind.
28. 11
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
courtesan Vasumitrā, stood before her with hands placed together in
homage, and said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it. Āryā, I have
heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that
you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and
how they should practice it!”
28. 12
Vasumitrā said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation
called the complete attainment of freedom from desire.


---

28. 13
“Noble one, in this way I appear to the devas in accordance with their
wishes in the form, color, shape, and size of an apsaras with a brighter and
purer color. In the same way, I appear in accordance with their wishes in a
female form, color, shape, and size with a brighter and purer color to the
nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans,
and nonhumans. [F.64.b]
28. 14
“When beings whose minds are encircled by desire come before me, I
teach all of them the Dharma so that they will become free from desire. When
they hear the Dharma, they attain freedom from desire. They attain the
bodhisattva samādhi called the realm
 of nonattachment. Some become free
from desire the instant they see me, and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi
called joyfulness. Some become free from desire when they hold my hand, and
they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called going to and residing in all the
buddha realms. Some become free from desire when they are alone in my
company, and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called the light of
detachment. Some become free from desire just by gazing upon me, and they
attain the bodhisattva samādhi called the display of the form of peace. Some
become free from desire just by yawning, and they attain the bodhisattva
samādhi called the disarraying of adversaries. Some become free from desire just
by closing their eyes, and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called the light
of the buddha domains. Some become free from desire just by embracing me,
[F.65.a] and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called the essence of gathering
and not abandoning all beings. Some become free from desire just by kissing me,
and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called touching the treasure of the merit
of all beings. In that way, I establish all the beings who come to me in the
bodhisattva liberation called the complete attainment of freedom from desire and the
manifestation of the attachment-free level of omniscience.”
1219
28. 15
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what roots of merit did you develop? What kinds
of activities did you accumulate so that you have attained this kind of
perfection?”
Vasumitrā replied, “Noble one, I remember that in a past time, there had
appeared in the world a tathāgata, an arhat, a samyak saṃbuddha, one with
wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who knows the world’s beings, an
unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a teacher of devas and humans, a
buddha, a bhagavat named Atyuccagāmin.
1220
28. 16
“The Tathāgata Atyuccagāmin, because of his love for beings, went to the
capital city named Sumukhā. When he placed his foot upon the threshold of
its gateway, the entire city shook and became huge, vast, and made of many
jewels. In the sky above, there was the light of a display of many jewels; it


---

was filled with various precious flowers, emitted the sound of various divine
musical instruments, and was pervaded by vast, measureless clouds of deva
bodies. [F.65.b]
28. 17
“Noble one, at that time, I was the wife of a head merchant, and my name
was Sumati. Inspired by the miracles of the Buddha,
 my spouse and I ran
and came to the Tathāgata in a street in the middle of the city. Developing a
fast faith, I offered to him one precious bell.
1221
1222
28. 18
“At that time, Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was an attendant of the Bhagavat,
the Tathāgata Atyuccagāmin. Through him I developed the aspiration to the
highest, complete enlightenment.
28. 19
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the complete
attainment of freedom from desire. How could I know the conduct or describe the
qualities of those bodhisattvas
 who dwell in infinite method and wisdom,
who have a vast, immense treasure of merit, and who are invincible in their
scope of wisdom?
1223
28. 20
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a city called
Śubhapāraṃgama. There dwells a householder by the name of Veṣṭhila who
makes offerings to a sandalwood chair that is a tathāgata shrine. Go to him
and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How
should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
28. 21
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
courtesan Vasumitrā, circumambulated the courtesan Vasumitrā many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back
again and again, departed from the courtesan Vasumitrā.

VEṢṬHILA
29. 1
Then Sudhana went to the town of Śubhapāraṃgama [F.66.a] and
approached the householder Veṣṭhila. He bowed his head to his feet, stood
before him, and, with his hands placed together in homage, said, “Ārya, I
have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I
do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in
what way they should practice it.
29. 2
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
29. 3
Veṣṭhila said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called
the attainment of the summit of inexhaustibility.
29. 4
“Noble one, from my mind’s viewpoint, a tathāgata has not passed into
nirvāṇa, does not pass into nirvāṇa, and will not pass into nirvāṇa in any
world other than as a way to bring beings who are to be guided under his
control, not as a way to enter truly complete nirvāṇa.
29. 5
“Noble one, in that way, when I opened the door of the sandalwood-
throne shrine of the Tathāgata, I attained, by opening the door of the shrine,
the bodhisattva samādhi called the display of the unceasing family of the buddhas.
“Noble one, in each instant of mind I rest in this samādhi, and I attain
many special features.”
29. 6
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, what is the scope of that samādhi?”
Veṣṭhila replied, “Noble one, when I am resting in this samādhi, [F.66.b]
there appear to me all the tathāgatas, such as Kāśyapa, in a continuous
succession of one buddha after another within the lineage of this world: all
the tathāgatas such as Kanaka muni, Krakucchanda, Viśvabhuk, Śikhin,
Vipaśyin, Tiṣya, Puṣya, Yaśottara, and Padmottara. I see in the consecutive
appearances of the buddhas the unceasing succession of one buddha after
another, a hundred buddhas in one instant of mind. In the next instant of

mind I perceive a thousand buddhas. In the next instant of mind I perceive a
hundred thousand buddhas. In the same way I see ten million buddhas, a
thousand million

 ten million billion buddhas,
 ten million million

 buddhas, a hundred thousand million billion
 buddhas, and ten

 buddhas, and so on, until in a subsequent moment
of mind I perceive an inexpressible number of inexpressible numbers of
buddhas appearing in succession. In the next instant of mind I see
tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in Jambudvīpa. In the next instant of
mind I see tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in an inexpressible number
of inexpressible numbers of buddha realms.

“I also perceive the successive accumulations for the first development of
the aspiration to enlightenment by those tathāgatas. I perceive the
miraculous powers they attain through their first development of the
aspiration to enlightenment. I perceive their pure fulfillment of their different
prayers. I perceive their pure conduct. I perceive their complete
accomplishment of the perfections. I perceive their attainment of all the
bodhisattva bhūmis. I perceive their pure attainment of patience. I perceive

the wheel of the Dharma. I perceive their attainment of the miraculous
powers, miracles, and miraculous manifestations of buddhahood.

“I remember and keep the Dharma teachings of these tathāgatas clearly

“I also see and know the future succession of buddhas, such as Maitreya. I
see a hundred buddhas in one instant of mind. In the next instant of mind I

“I know and comprehend the unbroken, unceasing succession of the

who in one fraction of an instant of their practice dwell in an array of
samādhis; who have entered into the sunlight of the tathāgatas;
 who

understand the equality of all concepts and misconceptions; who have
realized the samādhi that is equal to that of all the buddhas; who act in the
nonduality of self, beings, and buddhas; who are in the domain of the
display of the Dharma of natural luminosity; who have cut through the net of
the world with the device of wisdom; who act without disturbing the seal
of the Dharma of the tathāgatas; who have the scope of wisdom that
understands the entire realm of phenomena; who have the scope of wisdom
that understands the Dharma teaching of all the tathāgatas?
1241
29. 19
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, there is the mountain named
Potalaka. There dwells the bodhisattva by the name of Avalokiteśvara. Go to
him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ” [F.68.b]
29. 20
Then he spoke these two verses:
“Depart, Sudhana! In the center of the glorious king of the waters1242
Is beautiful Potalaka, king of mountains, the residence of heroes.
It has excellent trees made of jewels, is covered with flowers,
And is endowed with parks, lotus ponds, and flowing streams.

“Wise Avalokiteśvara who benefits beings —
That resolute one
 dwells on that supreme mountain.
1243
Go to him, Sudhana, and you will be taught
The qualities of
 the Guides, the entry into the way of vast goodness.”
1244
29. 22
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
householder Veṣṭhila, circumambulated the householder Veṣṭhila many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back
again and again, departed from the householder Veṣṭhila. [B5]

AVALOKITEŚVARA
30. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplating the instruction of
the householder Veṣṭhila, knowing that treasury of bodhisattva aspiration,
remembering that power of bodhisattva memory, keeping in his mind the
power of that successive lineage of the way of the buddhas, comprehending
the continuous succession of the lineage of the buddhas, remembering the
names of the buddhas that he had heard,
 being in accord with the way of
the Dharma taught by the buddhas, comprehending the array of attainments
through the Dharma
 of the buddhas, having confidence in the
proclamation
 of complete buddhahood by the buddhas, and focused on
the inconceivable activity of the tathāgatas, eventually came to the Potalaka
Mountain. [F.69.a] He ascended the Potalaka Mountain and searched and
searched for the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara.
1245
1246
1247
30. 2
He saw Avalokiteśvara on the upper slope
 of the western side of the
mountain. It was a fresh, gentle, verdant pasture like a circular area of blue
beryl and was beautified by springs, waterfalls, and streams,
 an open
grove within a great forest. He was teaching the Dharma, seated cross-
legged upon a diamond rock encircled by a countless assembly of
bodhisattvas seated upon rocks that were various jewels. He was giving the
Dharma teaching called The Clear Teaching of the Gateway to Love and
Compassion, which has as its scope the gathering of all beings into the
Dharma.
1248
1249
30. 3
On seeing him, Sudhana was filled with joy, delighted, elated, pleased,
and happy. With increasing rapture, he kept his eyes wide open. He placed
his hands together in homage. His mind was at peace through being
endowed with the power of faith in kalyāṇamitras. He believed that to see
kalyāṇamitras was to see all the buddhas. He believed that the acquisition of
the entire cloud of Dharma originated from the kalyāṇamitras. He believed
that all qualities and practices depended on the kalyāṇamitras. He believed


---

that it was difficult to encounter kalyāṇamitras. He believed that the
attainment of the precious wisdom of the ten strengths came from the
kalyāṇamitras. He believed that the inexhaustible light of wisdom
 came
from the kalyāṇamitras. He believed that the continuous increase of merit
was dependent on the kalyāṇamitras. He believed that the gateway to
omniscience was revealed by the kalyāṇamitras. [F.69.b] He believed that
entry into the great ocean of wisdom was taught by the kalyāṇamitras. He
believed that the gathering of the accumulation of omniscience was born
from the kalyāṇamitras.
1250
30. 4
He went toward the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. The bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara could see Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, coming in the
distance and said, “Come here! You are welcome,
 you who have entered
the inconceivable, vast Mahāyāna, which is beyond any analogy; you who
have the motivation to be a refuge for all beings who are tormented by
various sufferings that arise through being born and who have no refuge;
you who wish to witness all the Dharmas of the buddhas, which transcend
the world, are beyond analogy, and are beyond measure; you who are filled
with the power
 of great compassion and intend to liberate all beings; you
in whom the completely good conduct is evidently seen; you who aspire to
make pure a domain of great prayers; you who wish to possess the clouds of
Dharma of all the buddhas; you whose motivation to accumulate roots of
merit is never satisfied; you who follow perfectly the instructions of
kalyāṇamitras; you who are the source of a lotus
 of good qualities, arising
from the ocean of the wisdom of Mañjuśrī; you who are focused on attaining
the blessing of the buddhas; you who have attained the light and power of
samādhi; you who aspire to obtain the rain
 from the clouds of Dharma of
all the buddhas; you whose mind is made happy by the power of faith and
delight on seeing the buddhas; [F.70.a] you whose mind is moistened by the
power of immeasurable, inconceivable conduct; you who have become the
lord of a treasure of pure merit and wisdom through the power of the
practice of good qualities; you who are motivated to teach others the power
of the path to seeing omniscient wisdom; you who possess the root that is
the undiminishing power of great compassion; you who are intent on
possessing the power of the light of the wisdom of the tathāgatas.”
1251
1252
1253
1254
30. 5
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara. He bowed his head to the feet of the bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara. He circumambulated the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right. Then he stood
before him and, with his hands placed together in homage, said, “Ārya, I

have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I
do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in
what way they should practice it.
30. 6
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
30. 7
Then the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara extended his right hand, which was
the color of gold from the Jambu River and emanated a display of clouds of
countless networks of lights of various colors, and upon Sudhana’s head he
placed his hand, which had the multicolored light rays that shine from the
signs and features of a great being and bring stainless, measureless physical
and mental bliss. [F.70.b]
30. 8
The bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara said, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent,
that you have in that way developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment!

“Noble one, I know the gateway to bodhisattva activity called the
unimpeded gateway to great compassion.
30. 10
“Noble one, my gateway to bodhisattva activity called the unimpeded
gateway to great compassion ripens and guides beings without making any
distinctions among all beings, and it gathers and guides beings through
their completely hearing and knowing this gateway.
30. 11
“Noble one, in that way, being established in the gateway to bodhisattva
activity called the unimpeded gateway to great compassion, though I never depart
from being at the feet of all the tathāgatas, I remain focused on what should
be done for all beings. I gather beings through generosity. I gather beings
through pleasant words, through benefiting them, and through practicing
what I teach.
30. 12
“I also ripen beings through manifesting physical bodies. I gladden and
ripen beings through manifesting countless pure
 colors, shapes, and
forms and through radiating a net of light rays. I speak to them in
accordance with their aspirations. I manifest whatever path of conduct they
delight in. I teach them the Dharma in accordance with their various wishes.
I manifest various forms of miracles so as to inspire beings who have not
been attentive in accumulating virtuous qualities. I manifest a variety of
countless emanations in accordance with their wishes. I gather and ripen
beings by manifesting forms that accord with the states of the beings born in
the various classes of existence [F.71.a] and by living with them in the same
place.
1255
30. 13
“Noble one, in that way I have purified the gateway to bodhisattva activity
called the unimpeded gateway to great compassion and therefore prayed to be a
support for all beings. I have accomplished the prayer to be a support for all

beings in order that I end for all beings the fear of precipices, cause fears

 darkness,

in all beings. I have made the wheel of my name known in all worlds in order
to free all beings from fear. I miraculously manifest my body to be the
same
 as the distinct forms of all endless beings in order to be perceived
by beings at the appropriate times.
1260
30. 15
“Noble one, through this method, I liberate all beings from fear and cause
them to develop an irreversible aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment so that they will attain all the Dharmas of the buddhas.
30. 16
“Noble one, I know this gateway to bodhisattva activity called the
unimpeded gateway to great compassion, but how could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of the completely good bodhisattvas who have the
pure domain of the prayers of all buddhas; who have realized the completely
good conduct of bodhisattvas; who have an unbroken continuity of creating
virtuous qualities; who are always resting in a continuity of the samādhi of
all bodhisattvas; who have nonregressing conduct while residing in all
kalpas; who have the continuous understanding of the ways of all three
times; who are skilled in the continuity of the turning of the cycle of all world
realms; who have the continuity of ending nonvirtuous mentalities in all
beings; who have a continuity of increasing the virtuous mentalities of all
beings; [F.72.a] and who have the continuity of countering the continuity of
saṃsāra for all beings?”
30. 17
Concerning this it is said:
Sudhana, who was self-disciplined, circumambulated,
Praised reverently, and departed on the southern road —
He saw, residing in a cleft in a precious mountain,


---

Avalokiteśvara, a ṛṣi who abided in compassion. {1}
30. 18
The wise one was seated in the center of a lotus on a lion throne
On the side
 of the diamond mountain with various precious jewels.
1261
He was teaching the Dharma to the devas, asuras, nāgas,1262
Kinnaras, rākṣasas, and bodhisattvas who encircled him. {2}
30. 19
When Sudhana saw him, he was filled with unequaled joy,
Approached him, and bowed down to the feet of the ocean of qualities.
He said, “Ārya, have compassion and teach to me the training
So that I may attain good conduct.” {3}
30. 20
Extending his stainless hand, adorned by a hundred merits,
Which emitted excellent, vast networks of clouds of light,
And placing it upon Sudhana’s head, that pure being,
The wise one Avalokiteśvara, spoke these words: {4}
30. 21
“Son of the buddhas, I know one gateway to liberation,
Which is the mass of compassion, the essence of wisdom of all the jinas,
Which arises in order to gather and liberate all beings,
And my love for them thus courses everywhere. {5}
30. 22
“I protect all beings from every suffering.
Those who are tightly bound, who are in the hands of enemies,
Whose bodies are struck, and who are put into prisons
On hearing my name are freed from bondage. {6}
30. 23
“Those who have broken the law will escape execution
When at that time they remember my name.
Arrows that are fired will not hit their bodies.
Weapons that strike them will be not pierce them. {7} [F.72.b]
30. 24
“Those who remember my name will be invincible.
Though they enter the courts of lords, no matter who disputes with them,
They will be victorious over all adversaries and attain excellence,1263
And their fame, friends, families, and wealth will increase. {8}
30. 25
“Anyone who remembers my name
Entering forests fearful with thieves, fearful with enemies,
With lions, bears, leopards, wild beasts, yaks, and snakes,
Will be free of fear and victorious over enemies. {9}
30. 26
“When anyone who remembers my name
Is malevolently thrown from the summit of a great mountain1264
Or hurled into a blazing fire of coals,


---

The fire will transform into a treasure of water filled with lotuses. {10}
30. 27
“Anyone who instantly remembers my name
When thrown into the sea will not die there.
They will not be swept away by rivers or burn in the midst of fire.
In everything they will not fail but will be successful. {11}
30. 28
“Those who remember my name will attain liberation
From stocks, chains, manacles, and unjust punishments;
Dishonor, disrespect, constraints, and deception;
Abuse, beatings, threats, and scolding. {12}
30. 29
“All those who are hostile and seek to harm,
Who are always angry and speak unpleasant words,
Will become friendly the moment they see
Those who have heard and remember my name and will praise them. {13}
30. 30
“Anyone who remembers my name
Will always overpower those enemies
Who, in order to harm, practice vetāla mantras and sorcery,
And they will not be harmed by any poison. {14}
30. 31
“Those who have remembered my name will pacify
All nāga lords, hordes of rākṣasas, garuḍas, piśācas,
Kumbhāndas, and pūtanas who with wrathful minds cause harm,
Who steal vitality, and who terrify in dreams. {15}
30. 32
“Those who remember my name for a moment
Will not become separated from parents, friends, and relatives, [F.73.a]
And will not be in the company of those who dislike them;
Their wealth will not be exhausted, and they will not become poor. {16}
30. 33
“Anyone who remembers my name
Will not go to the Avīci hell when they die
But will be reborn as a good being, a deva or human,
And not as an animal or a preta, or in an unfortunate existence. {17}
30. 34
“Those who remember my name will become humans
Who are not blind, one-eyed, deaf, unable to walk,
Or with a limp, but who speak clearly and have a pleasant appearance,
And they will possess all faculties for many millions of kalpas. {18}
30. 35
{19}1265
30. 36
“Anyone who remembers my name


---

Will be a pure being who on passing away will be reborn
In the presence of buddhas in world realms in the ten directions,
Will see the buddhas, and will hear their Dharma. {20}
30. 37
“These and all my many other methods
For guiding beings in worlds are endless and innumerable.
Son of the buddhas, I meditate on this one liberation,
But I do not know all the qualities of those with qualities.” {21}
30. 38
{22}1266
30. 39
At that time the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin came from the east through the
sky and resided on a peak of the Cakravāla mountain range in the Sahā
world realm. The moment that the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin’s feet landed
on a peak of the Cakravāla mountain range in the Sahā world realm, the Sahā
world realm shook in six ways and transformed into being composed of
many jewels.
30. 40
The bodhisattva Ananyagāmin outshone the light of the sun and moon.
The light from his body outshone devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras,
garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, Śakra, Brahmā, the world guardians, fire,
jewels, lightning, and starlight. [F.73.b]
30. 41
He even illuminated the great hells. He illuminated all dark existences in
the realm of animals and the world of Yama. He caused all the sufferings in
the lower existences to instantly cease. All beings ceased to be tormented by
the kleśas. Various kinds of misery, pain, and suffering were alleviated. Rain
from clouds of jewels fell over all of this buddha realm, and there also fell
rain from clouds of a variety of offerings, the entire display of flowers,
perfumes, incense, garlands, ointments, powders, clothing, parasols,
banners, and flags.
30. 42
He then went to where the Bhagavat was, and the image of his body
appeared in the residences of all beings, appearing so as to satisfy them in
accordance with their wishes. He also appeared to come before the
bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara.
30. 43
Then the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara said to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, “Noble one, did you see the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin
coming to the gathering of this assembly?
30. 44
“Depart, noble one. Go to the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin and ask him,
‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
30. 45
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bodhisattva 
Avalokiteśvara, 
circumambulated 
the 
bodhisattva
Avalokiteśvara many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his
right, and, looking back again and again, departed from the bodhisattva

Avalokiteśvara. [F.74.a]

Chapter 31
ANANYAGĀMIN
31. 1
Sudhana, 
the 
head 
merchant’s 
son, 
his 
mind 
having 
acquired
Avalokiteśvara’s verses of wisdom,
 had not had enough of gazing on the
bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, but so as not to disobey his instruction, Sudhana
went to where the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin was.
1267
31. 2
He bowed his head to the feet of the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin. Then he
stood before him and, with his hands placed together in homage, said,
“Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
31. 3
“Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! Explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and how they should practice it!”
31. 4
Then the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin said, “Noble one, I have attained the
bodhisattva liberation called the arising of every gateway.”1268
31. 5
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, at the feet of which tathāgata did you attain the
bodhisattva liberation called the arising of every gateway? How far from here is
that world realm? How long did it take to come from that world realm?”
31. 6
The bodhisattva Ananyagāmin said, “Noble one, this is something that is
difficult to comprehend for beings such as the śramaṇas and brahmins in
this world with its devas, humans, and asuras. It is the power of the
bodhisattvas, the irreversible diligence of the bodhisattvas, and the
unsurpassable conduct of the bodhisattvas.
31. 7
“Noble one, those who are not in the care of a kalyāṇamitra, who are not
regarded by the buddhas, who have not accumulated the roots of merit, who
do not have a pure motivation, who have not attained the faculties of a
bodhisattva, and who do not have the eyes of wisdom [F.74.b] will not be
able to hear of it, grasp it, believe in it, or comprehend it.”


---

31. 8
Sudhana said, “Tell it to me, for I am apprehended
 by the buddhas and
in the care of kalyāṇamitras, and I have faith and aspiration!”
1269
31. 9
The bodhisattva Ananyagāmin said, “Noble one, I have come from a world
realm in the eastern direction that is called Śrīgarbhavatī, the buddha realm
of the Tathāgata Samanta śrī saṃbhava. I obtained the bodhisattva liberation
called the arising of every gateway at the feet of the Tathāgata Samanta śrī-
saṃbhava.
31. 10
“Noble one, as many kalpas as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya
of buddha realms passed while I came from the world realm Śrīgarbhavatī.
31. 11
“With each development of an aspiration, I took as many steps as there are
atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms. With each step, I passed
as many buddha realms as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of
buddha realms. There was a tathāgata in each of those buddha realms, and I
perceived all those buddha bhagavats. To all those tathāgatas I made
offerings that were authorized by the tathāgatas and were unsurpassable,
composed of the mind, and sealed by the noncomposite nature of
phenomena and gave rise to joy in bodhisattvas.
31. 12
“I saw in those world realms an ocean of beings, and I perceived the
ocean of all their minds. I knew the wheels of all their faculties, and I
manifested physical bodies in accord with their aspirations, proclaimed the
words of the Dharma, radiated a halo of light, brought them the gift of
various necessities, and empowered my own body, [F.75.a] so that I could
continuously be engaged in ripening and guiding them.
31. 13
“In the same way that I came from the east, I came from the south, from
the west, from the north, from the northeast, from the southeast, from the
southwest, from the northwest, from below, and from above.
31. 14
“Noble one, I know only the bodhisattva liberation called the arising of every
gateway. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
bodhisattvas who face in all directions; who have a scope of wisdom that is
without division; who distribute their bodies throughout the realm of
phenomena; who act in accord with the thoughts and aspirations of all
beings; who pervade all realms with their bodies; who act in conformance
with all phenomena; who have arrived at the equality of the three times; who
have bodies that are equal to the range of phenomena in every direction;
who illuminate every range of worlds of beings; who have no
conceptualization of the range of tathāgatas; who enter all regions without
impediment; and who dwell in the state that has no location?
31. 15
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, there is a city named
Dvāravatī. There dwells the deity by the name of Mahādeva. Go to him and
ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How
should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”


---

31. 16
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bodhisattva Ananyagāmin, circumambulated the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin
many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking
back again and again, departed from the bodhisattva Ananyagāmin. [F.75.b]

Chapter 32
MAHĀDEVA
32. 1
Sudhana had a mind that followed the vast conduct of bodhisattvas. He had
the nature of longing for the scope of the wisdom of the bodhisattva
Ananyagāmin. He saw the special qualities of accomplishing great higher
cognition. He had attained joy in the armor of stable diligence. He had the
aspiration to follow the displays
 of inconceivable liberations. He
practiced the qualities of the bodhisattva level. He analyzed on the level of
samādhi. He was established on the level of the power of retention. He
engaged in the level of prayer. He trained in the level of discernment. He
was accomplishing the level of power.
1270
32. 2
He eventually arrived at the city named Dvāravatī. He inquired about the
deity Mahādeva, and many people declared to him, “Noble one, this
 deva
Mahādeva is in the temple
 at the crossroads of the city, and with
greatness of being he is teaching the Dharma to beings.”
1271
1272
32. 3
Then Sudhana went to where the deity Mahādeva was. He bowed his
head to the feet of Mahādeva, stood before him with his hands together in
homage, and said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment. How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva
conduct? In what way does a bodhisattva practice it? Ārya, I have heard that
you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas. Therefore, Ārya, teach me
how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
practice it!”
32. 4
The deity Mahādeva extended his four arms, and from the four great
oceans and with the power of great speed he brought water and washed his
mouth. [F.76.a] He then scattered golden flowers on Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, and said, “Noble one, it is very difficult to see the
bodhisattvas. It is difficult to hear them. The appearance of the white lotuses
that are supreme beings is a great marvel because of its greatness; they are a
support for the world, a refuge for beings; they create a great light for


---

beings; they teach the path of truth to those on the path of ignorance; they
are guides for those who follow the way of the Dharma; they are great
guides for going to the city of omniscience.
32. 5
“Noble one,
 this is what I think: the bodhisattva mahāsattvas are called
the destroyers of wrong views because, with stainless minds, they manifest the
appearance of their pure bodies; they manifest the activities
 of their pure
bodies; they shine the light of eloquence of their faultless speech; and with a
pure motivation they remain manifest at all times.
1273
1274
32. 6
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the net of
clouds.”
Sudhana asked him, “What is the scope of the bodhisattva liberation called
the net of clouds?”
32. 7
In every direction in front of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, the deva
Mahādeva manifested mountain-sized heaps of gold, heaps of silver, heaps
of beryls, heaps of crystals, heaps of white corals, heaps of emeralds, heaps
of precious asteria jewels, heaps of precious vimalagarbha jewels, heaps of
precious vairocana jewels, heaps of precious topknot jewels, heaps of crowns,
heaps of necklaces made of various precious jewels, [F.76.b] heaps of
armlets, heaps of earrings, heaps of bracelets, heaps of girdles, heaps of
anklets, heaps of strings of red pearls,
 heaps of various precious jewels,
heaps of adornment for the greater and smaller parts of the body, heaps of
the kings of wish-fulfilling precious jewels, all flowers, all perfumes, all
incenses, all garlands, all ointments, all powders, all cloths, all parasols, all
banners, all flags, all musical instruments, all percussion instruments, all that
is desirable, and countless trillions of maidens.
1275
32. 8
Mahādeva said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, take
these, and with them perform acts of great generosity! Create much merit!
Make offerings to the tathāgatas! Gather many beings through generosity as
a method of gathering pupils! Practice the perfection of generosity! Teach
the world through generosity!
 Give that which is difficult to give!
1276
1277
32. 9
“Noble one, I gather for you this manner of things, and in that same way I
establish in generosity an incalculable number of beings whose minds have
an unceasing motivation to give. I cause them to generate roots of merit in
the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha and the bodhisattvas and kalyāṇamitras,
and I inspire them toward the highest, complete enlightenment.
32. 10
“Moreover, noble one, I bless with the ugliness of sensory objects those
beings who are intoxicated by the joys of desire and have attachment to the
enjoyment of sensory objects. [F.77.a]
32. 11
“I manifest terrifying wrathful bodies like rākṣasas, eating flesh and
drinking blood, to those who are possessed by anger, who are proud,
arrogant, conceited, and haughty, and who are to be guided through


---

destruction, pacifying all who are agitated by pride and arrogance.1278
32. 12
“I manifest the danger of being harmed by fire, water, kings, and thieves
for beings who are lazy and abandon diligence, causing them to be
distressed and become diligent.
32. 13
“In that way, through those methods, I turn them away from that which is
not virtuous and establish them in a perfection of virtue so that they may
defeat all that is adverse to the perfections, gather all the accumulations of
the perfections, transcend all the paths of the mountain precipices of
obscurations, and enter the unobscured Dharma.
32. 14
“Noble one, I know only the bodhisattva liberation called the net of clouds.
How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of bodhisattvas
who are like Indra defeating the asuras of the kleśas, who are like water
extinguishing the mass of fire of the suffering of all beings, who are like a
mass of flames drying up the water of the cravings of all beings, who are like
a wind scattering the mountain of all clinging to attachment, and who are
like thunderbolts shattering the hard rock of the perception of a self?
1279
32. 15
“Depart, noble one. In this Jambudvīpa, in the land of Magadha, at the
bodhimaṇḍa, there is the goddess of the earth who is named Sthāvarā. Go to
her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct?
How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ” [F.77.b]
32. 16
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
deva Mahādeva, circumambulated the deva Mahādeva many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from the deva Mahādeva.

Chapter 33
STHĀVARĀ
33. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, eventually reached the goddess of
the earth, Sthāvarā, in the land of Magadha’s bodhimaṇḍa. When he arrived
there, one million earth goddesses proclaimed to one another, “Someone
who will be a refuge for all beings is coming here! Someone who has the
essence of the tathāgatas and who will break open the enclosing egg of
ignorance of all beings is coming here! Someone who is in the family of the
kings of Dharma and will attain the state of an unimpeded, stainless king of
the Dharma is coming here! Someone who is a hero with the thunderbolt
weapon that has the great power of wisdom and who will subdue the circle
of opponents is coming here!”
33. 2
At that moment, Sthāvarā and the other one million earth goddesses shook
the great earth, caused a loud sound like deep thunder, and illuminated the
world realm of a billion worlds with a vast light. Their bodies were adorned
by all adornments and precious jewelry. They shone and moved in the sky
like a mass of streaks of lightning.
33. 3
They rose up out of the ground, causing the seedlings of all trees to
sprout; causing all flowering trees to blossom; causing all rivers to flow;
causing lakes, ponds, and reservoirs to rise; causing a great rain of scented
water to fall; causing a great wind that scattered a cloud of flowers to blow;
causing a quintillion musical instruments to sound; [F.78.a] causing a
multitude of divine aerial palaces and ornaments to spread; causing the lords
of cows, bulls, elephants, tigers, and deer to make their cries; causing the
leaders of devas, asuras, nāgas,
 and bhūtas to roar; causing the great
lords of mountains to clash together; and causing trillions of masses of
treasures to emerge.
1280
33. 4
Then the earth goddess Sthāvarā said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, “Noble one, it is excellent that you have come here.
 This area is
where in the past you dwelled and generated roots of merit, where I am the
1281


---

witness for that. Do you wish to see just a fraction of their ripening?”
33. 5
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the earth
goddess Sthāvarā. He circumambulated the earth goddess Sthāvarā many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right. Then he stood
before her and, with his hands placed together in homage, said, “Āryā, I do
wish it!”
33. 6
Then the earth goddess Sthāvarā stamped on the ground with the sole of
her foot and revealed an array of countless millions of millions of precious
treasures and said, “Noble one, these millions of millions of precious
treasures follow you. They go before you. You can use them as you like. They
come from the ripening of your merit. They are protected by the power of
your merit. You can take from among them whatever you need.
33. 7
“Noble one, moreover, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
essence of invincible wisdom. [F.78.b] Through my possessing this bodhisattva
liberation, since the time of the Tathāgata Dīpaṅkara I have constantly
followed bodhisattvas and always protected them. Since that time, noble one,
I have practiced the mental conduct of the bodhisattvas, been immersed
within the scope of wisdom, entered the domain of prayer, realized pure
bodhisattva conduct, followed the ways of all samādhis, permeated the vast
motivations and higher cognitions of all bodhisattvas, and realized,
possessed, and acquired mastery of the powers of all bodhisattvas, the
pervasion of the network of all realms, the acquisition of prophecies from all
the tathāgatas, the sight at all times of the attainment of buddhahood, all the
ways of turning the wheel of the Dharma, all the ways of the clouds of
Dharma that elucidate the sūtras, the way of illumination by the great
radiance of the Dharma, the way of completely ripening all beings, and the
way of the display of all the miraculous manifestations of the buddhas.
33. 8
“Noble one, I received this bodhisattva liberation, the essence of invincible
wisdom, far beyond and even more beyond as many past kalpas as there are
atoms in Sumeru, during a kalpa called Avabhāsa vyūha, in a world realm
called Candra dhvajā, from the Tathāgata Sunetra. [F.79.a]
33. 9
“Noble one, in that way, until this Bhadra kalpa, while cultivating,
practicing,
 increasing, and augmenting this bodhisattva liberation called
the essence of invincible wisdom, I have never been deprived of the sight of the
tathāgatas.
1282
1283
33. 10
“During that time, I have propitiated as many tathāgata arhat samyak-
saṃbuddhas as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
I have seen the miraculous manifestation of all those tathāgatas going to the
bodhimaṇḍa. I have witnessed the roots of merit of all those tathāgatas.

33. 11
“Noble one, I know only the bodhisattva liberation called the essence of
invincible wisdom. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
bodhisattvas who attend all tathāgatas, who follow the teaching of all
buddhas, who enter into the impenetrable wisdom of the tathāgatas, who
have the power to pervade the entire realm of phenomena in one instant of
mind, who have bodies that are the same as those of the tathāgatas, who
have the essence of the stainless intention of all the buddhas, who always
realize all appearances of buddhas, and who are emissaries inseparable from
the activity
 of the buddhas?
1284
33. 12
“Depart, noble one. In this Jambudvīpa, in the land of Magadha, in the city
of Kapilavastu, is the goddess of the night named Vāsantī. [F.79.b] Go to her
and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How
should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
33. 13
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
earth goddess Sthāvarā, circumambulated the earth goddess Sthāvarā many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back
again and again, departed from the earth goddess Sthāvarā.

Chapter 34
VĀSANTĪ
34. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembering the teaching of the earth
goddess Sthāvarā, remembering the bodhisattva liberation called the essence of
invincible wisdom, becoming adept in the meditation of bodhisattva samādhi,
contemplating the way of the bodhisattva Dharma, analyzing the displays of
bodhisattva liberation, viewing the very subtle wisdom of bodhisattva
liberation, entering the ocean of the wisdom of bodhisattva liberation, with
faith in the different wisdoms of bodhisattva liberation, realizing the mastery
of the wisdom of bodhisattva liberation, and descending into the ocean of
the wisdom of bodhisattva liberation, arrived at the location of the town of
Kapilavastu.
34. 2
He circumambulated the town of Kapilavastu, keeping it to his right, and
entered the town through its eastern gate.
34. 3
He stayed at the town’s central junction of three streets, where, soon after
sunset, wishing to see Vāsantī, the goddess of the night, while reverentially
following the bodhisattva teaching, having the definite understanding that
the wisdom of buddhahood is attained through kalyāṇamitras, having the
blessing of the scope of the view of the eyes of wisdom, facing every
direction [F.80.a] with the aspiration to see the kalyāṇamitra, with a mind
that perceives the essence of great wisdom, with eyes of wisdom that
engage with all objects of perception, with eyes of samādhi that pervade the
vast extent of the ocean of the wisdom of all the ways of the realm of
phenomena, seeing the ocean of all that is to be known in all directions, with
a single-pointed mind intent on attaining the eyes of wisdom resting with
one-pointed thought, he saw Vāsantī, the goddess of the night, in the realm
of space above the great town of Kapilavastu. She was in a kūṭāgāra of
various precious jewels beyond compare. She was seated upon a lotus that
had every excellent aroma, in the center of a great precious lion throne. Her
body was the color of gold. Her hair was soft, abundant, and deep black. Her


---

eyes were deep black.
 She was beautiful, attractive, and lovely to the
sight. Her body was beautified by all jewelry and adornments. She was
wearing dyed
 clothing. She possessed a sacred topknot adorned by the
disk of the moon as a crest. The constellations, the planets, and all the stars
appeared in her body.
1285
1286
34. 4
He saw within her pores all the beings she had liberated who in the vast
realm of beings had fallen into inopportune states, lower existences, and
lower realms.
34. 5
He saw within her pores all those she had brought to the higher realms,
all those she had ripened for the enlightenment of the śrāvakas and
pratyeka buddhas, and those she had ripened for omniscience.
34. 6
He saw within her pores all her created bodies, [F.80.b] created forms, and
created colors that were her various methods that ripened beings.
34. 7
He heard sounding from her pores the creation of sounds, the creation of
the aspects of the voice, and their application to the various ways of
speech
 through which she ripened beings.
1287
34. 8
He perceived within her pores her creation of times, her bodhisattva
conduct, her bodhisattva prowess, her entrances to bodhisattva samādhis
and transformations, her bodhisattva power of leadership, her bodhisattva
states of being,
 her bodhisattva view, her bodhisattva observation, her
bodhisattva emanations, her bodhisattva lion-like awesomeness of a great
being, and her displays of bodhisattva liberation through which she ripened
beings in accordance with their motivations and aspirations.
1288
34. 9
He saw and heard an ocean of the ways of the Dharma that employed
various methods, and he was satisfied, joyful, pleased, delighted, content,
and happy. He prostrated to the night goddess Vāsantī with the full length
of his body, got up, and circumambulated the night goddess Vāsantī,
keeping her to his right, many hundreds of thousands of times. Then he
stood before her and, with his hands placed together in homage, said,
“Goddess, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment. I have seen that all the qualities of buddhahood arise
through the blessing of a kalyāṇamitra. [F.81.a] I put myself in the hands of
the kalyāṇamitra. Show me, goddess, the path to omniscience upon which a
bodhisattva will bring forth the ten strengths.”
34. 10
The night goddess Vāsantī said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
“Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you are thus in awe of
kalyāṇamitras and wish to hear a kalyāṇamitra’s words and practice the
teaching of kalyāṇamitras.
34. 11
“Noble one, through thus practicing the teaching of the kalyāṇamitras,
you will, without a doubt, approach the highest, complete enlightenment.

“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to
guiding beings through the radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all
beings. My mind has love for beings who have unstable minds. My mind has
compassion for beings who follow the path of nonvirtuous actions. My mind
rejoices in those who follow the path of virtuous actions. My mind does not
discriminate between beings with stable and unstable minds. My motivation
is to purify those afflicted by the kleśas. My motivation is to bring the pitiful
to perfection. My motivation is to generate a vast aspiration in those with
inferior aspiration. My motivation is to develop great diligence in those with
inferior power.
 [F.81.b] My motivation is to turn away from existences in
the cycle of saṃsāra those whose aspiration is for saṃsāra. My motivation is
to establish on the path to omniscience those beings whose aspiration is for
the Śrāvakayāna and Pratyeka buddhayāna.

the bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to guiding beings through the
radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all beings.

around, the numbers of thieves and robbers increase, dangerous beings are
active in all directions, thick black clouds cover everything, there is a thick
mass of smoke or dust, there is the assault of terrible wind and rain, the
moon and stars are hidden, and the eyes are unable to see.

darkness who are on the ocean, on a plain, on mountains, in a remote
wilderness,

 a forest, in the countryside, in a town, in a direction, in
an intermediate direction, or on a road; those on the ocean whose ship is
sinking; those who are in distress; those on the plains; those who are falling
down precipices in the mountains; those who have no food or drink in
remote wildernesses; those caught in thickets of bamboo in dense forests;
those whom calamitous wrongdoing has befallen; [F.82.a] those who are
being slain by bandits in the countryside; those who perish from ruthless
actions in towns; those who are bewildered in the directions; those who are
confused in the intermediate directions; and those who encounter disaster
on the road.

calm the huge powerful waves, I bring freedom from the danger of lightning,
I show the direction to go, I provide the correct course over the waters, I
reveal the shore, and I show the way to reach the island of jewels. I protect
them in the form of a gatherer of beings,
 the form of a merchant leader,
the form of a great-maned king of horses, the form of a king of elephants, the

 are in great darkness and the
ground is covered with bamboo, thorns, pebbles, and potsherds; when there

fierce wind and rain, being stricken with the suffering of heat and cold, and
the fear of snakes and wild beasts; and when bands of murderers and
bandits are prowling around, I protect those beings who are confused in the
dark, in the form of the sun, in the form of the moon, in the form of the rising
of dawn, in the form of great shooting stars, in the form of flashes of
lightning, in the form of the light of jewels, in the form of the circle of the

afraid of dying and who through clinging to life are under the power of the
desire for fame, who desire the banner of words of renown, who have
enjoyment as their goal, who are overpowered by desire, who are engaged
in the pursuit of the prerequisites for life, who primarily yearn for worldly
good fortune, who are tied by affection to children and wife,
 who are lost
in the thicket of views, and who are oppressed by various kinds of suffering
and fears.

“I do so in this way: by providing them with caves and shelters, by
providing them with fruit and roots to eat, by providing them with streams
and springs, by providing them with protection against heat and cold,

avadavat, by the sound of the cry of the king of peacocks, through the form
of illumination from burning herbs, and through the form of light from the
mountain deities.

beings who are in the mountains, may I become a protector for those who
have fallen into the chasms of the mountain of saṃsāra and have been

bondage to house and home, who are bewildered in the darkness of the

cause them to develop a mind free of attachment. I care for them through the
gift of the Dharma. I make them perfectly content and establish them in the
Dharma that has no home.

free all beings dwelling in the town of their six āyatanas from the realm of
activity that is existence in saṃsāra, and may I establish them in the realm of
activity of the wisdom of omniscience.’
34. 32

markets,
 kingdoms, and capitals to exhausted travelers. I reveal springs,
ponds, lakes, reservoirs, lotus ponds, rivers, forests, orchards, and gardens

At that time, Vāsantī, the goddess of the night, in order to teach further the

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
34. 43
“I teach the Dharma so as to benefit beings,1315
In order to dispel the darkness of ignorance and stupidity.
I observe the time and bring happiness to beings.
This is my supreme way of liberation, of peace. {1}
34. 44
“I have perfectly practiced vast love,1316
Meditating throughout limitless kalpas in the past.
In that way, I have filled the world with illumination.
Sudhana, know this way well.

“My ocean of compassion is measureless.

“Creating worldly happiness

“Always turned away from composite faults
And the wisdom, liberation, and results of the śrāvakas,

I purify the strengths of the buddhas.
Jinaputra, understand this way of mine. {5}
34. 48
“My eyesight is vast and completely pure.
With it I see many realms in the ten directions.
I see the self-originated ones in those realms
Seated under the lords of Bodhi trees. {6}
34. 49
“I see the buddhas and their assemblies,
The buddhas’ bodies beautified by signs,
Emanating multicolored beautiful light rays,
A multitude of light rays emanating from all their pores. {7}
34. 50
“I see the beings within those realms
And their entrances into death and rebirth,
Those foolish ones who in those oceans of existences
Continue in saṃsāra and experience the results of their actions. {8}
34. 51
“Completely pure is the ocean of my hearing
In which are gathered all sounds without exception.
I hear and hold in my memory
The entire ocean of the languages in all worlds. {9}

“The speech beyond analogy or equal,
Adorned by all aspects of speech and all sounds,

“My mind is without attachment, undefiled.

Though all lords of humans are contained in it,
I have no conceptualization concerning that. {14}
34. 57
“I know the ocean of the minds
Of the countless beings in the realms.
I know their faculties and aspirations,
But in this I have no conceptualization. {15}

34. 64
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, asked Vāsantī, the goddess of the
night, “Goddess, how long has it been since you have been established in
the highest, complete enlightenment? [F.87.b] How long has it been since
you attained this liberation through which you have become established in
accomplishing the benefit of beings in this way?”


---

34. 65
Vāsantī, the goddess of the night, answered, “Noble one, beyond and
even more beyond as many past kalpas as there are atoms in Sumeru, during
a kalpa called Praśantaprabha, there was a world realm called Ratna śrī-
saṃbhava in which there appeared five thousand million buddhas. Within
that world realm there was a medium-sized four-continent world called
Ratna candra pradīpa prabhā, the capital of which was called Padmaprabhā.
In that capital city there was King Sudharmatīrtha, who was a cakravartin
Dharma king who ruled over the four continents and possessed the seven
jewels. He spread the Dharma over the mountains and seas of that great
world up to its edges and made it happy. King Sudharmatīrtha had a queen
named Dharma mati candrā. At dusk, intoxicated by desire and exhausted by
bliss, she returned to the harem at midnight and went to sleep. To the east of
the capital city of Padmaprabhā there was a great forest called Śamatha śrī-
sambhava, in which appeared a tathāgata by the name of Sarva dharma-
nigarjita rāja, whose body shone with the light of all kings of jewels and was
the miraculous manifestation of all the buddhas. At the foot of a Bodhi tree,
he attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood. Through
the power of that, a great light of many colors filled the world realm of
Ratna śrī saṃbhava. In the capital city of Padmaprabhā there was a goddess
of the night called Suviśuddha candrābhā. [F.88.a] She approached Dharma-
mati candrā, the king’s queen, woke her with the sound of rattling her
jewelry, and said to her, ‘Know this, queen of the king! The Tathāgata Sarva-
dharma nigarjita rāja has attained the highest, complete enlightenment of
buddhahood in the great forest Śamatha śrī sambhava.’ Then, in front of the
king’s queen she praised the qualities of the buddha and described at length
the miraculous manifestations of the buddhas and the completely good
conduct and prayer of the bodhisattvas.
34. 66
“Noble one, the king’s queen was illuminated by the light from that
tathāgata, and she sincerely entered into the path to the highest, complete
enlightenment. She made offerings to that tathāgata and his saṅgha of
bodhisattvas and śrāvakas.
34. 67
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was that
king’s queen, Dharma mati candrā? Do not think that it was anyone else, for at
that time, in that time, I was the king’s queen, Dharma mati candrā.
34. 68
“Noble one, under that tathāgata I developed the motivation of aspiration
and created roots of merit so that for kalpas as numerous as the atoms in
Sumeru I never fell into rebirth in the lower realms. I was never reborn as a
denizen of hell, as an animal, or as a preta. I was never reborn in an inferior
family. I was never reborn as someone without sensory faculties. I was never
someone who suffered. I always attained the state of a great deity among


---

deities, [F.88.b] and a great human among humans. In this way, I was never
apart from buddhas and bodhisattva kalyāṇamitras. I was never reborn in a
bad time.
34. 69
“Noble one, in that way, I created roots of merit under one buddha after
another, and for as many kalpas as there are atoms in Sumeru, I traveled on
easy and level paths without any impediment, but I had not yet
accomplished the powers of a bodhisattva. When those kalpas as numerous
as the atoms in Sumeru had passed, ten thousand great kalpas before this
Bhadra kalpa, at the time of the first of those kalpas, which was called
Aśokaviraja, there was a world realm called Rajovimala tejaḥśrī.
34. 70
“Noble one, that world realm Rajovimala tejaḥśrī was completely pure of
the kleśas, and five hundred buddhas appeared within it. The first of those
five hundred buddhas was a tathāgata, an arhat, a samyak saṃbuddha, one
with wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who knows the world’s beings,
an unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a teacher of devas and humans, a
buddha, a bhagavat, who was named Sumeru dhvajāyatana śānta netra śrī. At
that time, I was Prajñāvabhāsa śrī, the daughter of the head merchant
Vighuṣṭakīrti. I was beautiful and attractive, a delight to see, with a very
beautiful, perfect complexion.
1321
34. 71
“The goddess of the night called Suviśuddha candrābhā, through the
power of her prayers, had become the goddess of the night called Viśuddha-
netrābhā in Vicitra dhvaja, the capital of the four-continent world realm
named Virajovatī. At night, while I was not yet asleep and my parents were
asleep, [F.89.a] she shook our house, illuminated it with a great light,
revealed her own form to me, and praised the qualities of the buddhas. She
revealed the tathāgata residing at the bodhimaṇḍa seven days after he had
attained buddhahood.
34. 72
“Then, accompanied by my parents and a great crowd of my family, and
preceded by Viśuddha netrābhā, the goddess of the night, I went into the
presence of that tathāgata. I then made vast offerings to the Tathāgata, and
as soon as I saw the Tathāgata’s face, I attained the samādhi called guiding
beings and seeing the Buddha’s face and the samādhi called the domain illuminated
by the wisdom of the range of the three times. Through attaining them I
remembered as many kalpas as there are atoms in Sumeru. My aspiration to
enlightenment manifested. In that way, I heard the Dharma from that
tathāgata, and I attained the bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to
guiding beings through the radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all
beings. Through attaining that, I pervaded with my body as many worlds as
there are atoms in ten buddha realms, and there appeared to my sight all the
buddhas who were present in those worlds, and I knew that I was present at
the feet of all of them. All of the beings who had been born in those world


---

realms appeared to my sight, and I knew all the symbols of their different
languages. I knew their minds, thoughts, faculties, and aspirations. [F.89.b] I
knew the past kalyāṇamitras in whose presence they were ripened. I
manifested to them the bodies that satisfied them according to their
aspirations. That liberation of mine increased with each instant of the mind.
Through the instant of mind that followed that instant of mind of liberation,
my body pervaded as many buddha realms as there are atoms in a hundred
world realms. Through the next instant of mind, my body pervaded as many
buddha realms as there are atoms in a thousand world realms. Through the
next instant of mind, my body pervaded as many buddha realms as there are
atoms in a hundred thousand world realms, and so on, up to my body
pervading, in each instant of mind, as many buddha realms as there are
atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of world realms. There appeared to my
sight all the buddhas that were present in those worlds, and I knew that I
was present at the feet of all of them. I obtained all the Dharma that was
taught by those buddha bhagavats. I possessed it, kept it, preserved it. I
comprehended the past ocean of ways and ocean of prayers of those
tathāgatas. All those buddha realms purified by those tathāgatas were
created in order to purify their own buddha realms. All of the beings who
had been born in those world realms appeared to my sight. I blessed my
body in order to ripen and guide all of their different minds, thoughts,
faculties, and aspirations. [F.90.a]
34. 73
“Thus, the way in which my liberation pervaded the entire extent of the
realm of phenomena increased with each instant of mind.
34. 74
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the gateway to
guiding beings through the radiance of the Dharma that eliminates the darkness of all
beings. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of
bodhisattvas who have arisen from the completely good bodhisattva
conduct and prayers that have no middle or edge; who have the power to
enter the entire extent of the ways of the ocean of the realm of phenomena;
who play in the samādhi called the glorious vajra of wisdom, which is attained
by bodhisattvas
 who have arisen from the great prayers to be in the care
of all the families of tathāgatas in all world realms; who have accomplished a
great ocean of merit that purified in an instant of mind the vast extent of
world realms; who in each instant of mind ripen all the realms of beings; who
have the eyes of the sun of wisdom that dispels all the darkness of the
obscurations of all beings in all the world realms that are under the power of
their guiding wisdom; who have the power to communicate the Mahāyāna
to all the realms of beings; who possess the moon of intelligence that dispels
the darkness of doubt, uncertainty, and equivocation within all beings; who
have the pure domain of speech that lifts beings from attachment to the
1322


---

entire ocean of existence; who have the power to manifest emanations in the
atoms throughout the entire realm of phenomena; [F.90.b] and who are
inseparable from the domain of the knowledge of the entire range of the
three times?
34. 75
“Depart, noble one. At the bodhimaṇḍa in this land of Magadha there is
the goddess of the night called Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā, whom I
have inspired again and again to develop the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva
train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
34. 76
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, praised the night goddess
Vāsantī with these verses:
34. 77
“I see the purity of your body
Adorned by signs, like Meru,
Superior to all worlds; within the world
You have a perfect body as beautiful as Mañjuśrī’s. {22}
34. 78
“Your Dharma body is completely pure,
The same in all three times, without conceptualization.
Every world without exception is contained within it
Without creation, destruction, or abiding. {23}
34. 79
“I see the image of your body dispersed
Throughout the whole extent of existences,
And I see within the pores of your body
The constellations of stars with the moon and planets. {24}
34. 80
“Your mind also is completely pure,
Pervading the realm of space in all directions.
Even the supreme among humans are all included within it.
You possess the supreme wisdom free of concepts. {25}
34. 81
“Multicolored clouds as numerous as the atoms in a realm
Arise out of all the pores of your body, [F.91.a]
Spread to the buddhas in the ten directions,
And send down a rainfall of all adornments. {26}
34. 82
“The endless number of the bodies as numerous as beings
Arise out of the pores of your body.
They pervade and fill the worlds in the ten directions
And purify
 beings through various methods. {27}
1323
34. 83
“I see an inconceivable number of realms
With various different displays in all your pores.


---

They appear in accordance with all the aspirations
Of those you purify in the various existences of beings. {28}
34. 84
“Whoever rejoices on hearing your name
Will easily attain their goals and live well.
Whatever being sees your body
Will be facing the path to enlightenment. {29}
34. 85
“Merely seeing you causes the kleśas to cease
In one who rejoices on hearing your name.
I would endure countless kalpas in the lower realms
So that I could see your face. {30}
34. 86
“If I were to create as many bodies as there are atoms in a thousand realms,
And for the duration of that same number of kalpas
They were to describe the qualities of just one of your pores,
They would never be able to reach the end of that description.” {31}
34. 87
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
night goddess Vāsantī, circumambulated the night goddess Vāsantī many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back
again and again with unfulfilled longing, departed from the night goddess
Vāsantī. [B6] [F.91.b]

Chapter 35
SAMANTA GAMBHĪRA ŚRĪ VIMALA PRABHĀ
35. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplating the night goddess
Vāsantī’s first entry into the pure domain of aspiration to enlightenment,
analyzing the arising of the essence of a bodhisattva, comprehending the
ocean of bodhisattva prayer, purifying the bodhisattva path of perfections,
overcoming the domain of the bodhisattva levels, augmenting the domain of
bodhisattva conduct, following
 an ocean of the setting-forth of
bodhisattvas, looking at the ocean of the great illumination of omniscience,
increasing the bodhisattva clouds of great compassion intent on saving all
beings, and attaining the blessing of the completely good bodhisattva
conduct and prayer of the night goddess Vāsantī that extends to the limits of
all realms, went to the location of the night goddess Samanta gambhīra śrī-
vimala prabhā. Having reached her, he bowed his head to the feet of the
night goddess Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā, circumambulated the
night goddess Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and then stood before her and,
with palms together, said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment. However, I do not know how a
bodhisattva practices on the level of a bodhisattva, how a bodhisattva sets
forth, how a bodhisattva accomplishes.” [F.92.a]
1324
35. 2
She answered, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment and that
you ask how to practice, set forth, and accomplish on the level of a
bodhisattva. It is through possessing ten qualities that bodhisattvas
accomplish bodhisattva conduct. What are these ten? They are (1) the pure
attainment of the samādhi that directly perceives all the tathāgatas; (2) the
pure eyesight that sees the bodies, endowed with the various signs, of all
the buddhas; (3) realizing the perception of the centerless, endless ocean of
the colors of the tathāgatas; (4) comprehending the extent of the entire realm


---

of phenomena and the measureless ocean of the domain of the radiant
qualities of the buddhas; (5) comprehending the ocean of light rays from the
pores of all the tathāgatas that are as numerous as all beings and radiate to
benefit the variety of beings; (6) seeing an ocean of light rays, the colors of all
jewels, coming from each pore; (7) comprehending the ocean of emanations
of the buddhas that in each instant of mind pervade the entire realm of
phenomena and give the blessing that guides beings; (8) comprehending the
domain of thunder from the clouds of all the sūtras through possessing the
speech of the tathāgatas, which has the aspects of the voices of all beings,
and the sound of the wheel of the Dharma appearing in the three times; (9)
comprehending the centerless and endless ocean of the signs of the
buddhas; and (10) comprehending the guiding of beings through the
manifestation of the inconceivable emanations of the buddhas.
35. 3
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who possess these ten qualities [F.92.b]
accomplish bodhisattva conduct.
35. 4
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called complete
subjugation through the bliss of the peace of śamatha.
35. 5
“Noble one, through its power I see all the tathāgatas who are in the three
times, and I perceive the completely pure buddha realms of those tathāgatas.
I perceive the ocean of their assemblies of followers, the ocean of their
centerless and endless miraculous manifestations from samādhi, the ocean
of their past practices, and the ocean of their names. I also perceive each
separate turning of the wheel of the Dharma by those tathāgatas. I perceive
the various lifespans and different aspects of voice of those tathāgatas and
the bodies of those tathāgatas who have the nature of the centerless and
limitless realm of phenomena.
35. 6
“Those tathāgatas are not attached to things as being existent. Why is
that? Those tathāgatas do not go because of their cessation of going through
all worlds. Those tathāgatas do not arrive because their nature has no
arising. Those tathāgatas are unborn because they have a body that is the
same as the birthless true nature. Those tathāgatas are unceasing because
they have the characteristic of birthlessness. Those tathāgatas are not
true
 because of perceiving and seeing phenomena to be illusions. Those
tathāgatas are not false because there arises benefit for all beings. Those
tathāgatas do not pass away because they have transcended death, passing,
and birth. [F.93.a] Those tathāgatas are not destroyed because the
indestructible true nature is the nature of phenomena. All those tathāgatas
have a single characteristic because of their transcendence of all paths of
speech. Those tathāgatas do not have characteristics because they are the
termination of the nature of the characteristics of phenomena.
1325

35. 7
“Noble one, I perceive all tathāgatas in that way, and through the radiance
of the tathāgatas’ domain of dhyāna, I increase this bodhisattva liberation
called complete subjugation through the bliss of the peace of śamatha; I make it vast,
perceive it, realize it, make it even, accomplish it, make it level, enter it,
augment it, contemplate it, reflect upon it, am mindful of it, make it my field
of practice, make it firm, illuminate it, explain it, divide it, categorize it, unite
it, and have conviction in it.
35. 8
“I meditate on the first dhyāna in order to remain in that great compassion
in which there is no movement of any thought and in order to have a single-
pointed mind for engaging in saving all beings.
35. 9
“I meditate on the second dhyāna in order to pacify all mental activity and,
through the strength and power of wisdom, to have a one-pointed mind
with joy of bliss in gathering all beings.
35. 10
“I meditate on the third dhyāna in order to have equanimity toward the
distress of saṃsāra and to realize the nature
 of all beings. [F.93.b]
1326
35. 11
“I meditate on the fourth dhyāna in order to bring an end to the kleśas and
suffering of all beings.
35. 12
“I purify the way of the wisdom that enters the realm of phenomena
through every gateway and thus meditate on this bodhisattva liberation
called complete subjugation through the bliss of the peace of śamatha in order to
increase
 the domain of aspiration for omniscience, to become skilled in
the accomplishment of an ocean of samādhis, to realize the ways of the
ocean of all bodhisattva liberations, and to have the higher cognition of all
the wisdoms displayed by bodhisattvas.
1327
35. 13
“Noble one, in that way I meditate on this liberation and ripen beings
through various methods: I instill in the beings who enjoy carnal pleasure in
the peace of the night the perception of it as ugliness, the perception of it as
lack of pleasure, the perception of it as wearying, the perception of it as an
obstacle, the perception of it as bondage, the perception of it as a rākṣasī, the
perception of impermanence, the perception of suffering, the perception of
no self, the perception of no ownership, the perception of dependence on
others,
 the perception of aging and death, and the perception of a lack of
joy in all indulgence in desires. When those beings meditate on that state of
mind, they will take no delight in any indulgence in carnal pleasure and will
instead aspire to enjoy the delights of the Dharma and leave home for
homelessness. When they dwell in solitude, [F.94.a] I instill in them the faith
that accords with the Dharma. I cause all loud, frightening, unpleasant
sounds to cease, and in the peace of the night I teach the profound Dharma
of the buddhas.
1328


---

35. 14
“I gather
 the conditions necessary for renunciation. I open the door of
the house for their departure. I show them the path. I illuminate it. I dispel
the darkness. I free them from fear. I praise departure from home. I describe
the qualities of buddhahood. I explain the excellence of the Dharma, the
excellence of the saṅgha, and the excellence of the kalyāṇamitra. I praise
going to a kalyāṇamitra.
1329
35. 15
“Noble one, meditating on this liberation, I eliminate in beings the passion
and desire for what is not Dharma, and thoughts of desire for what is not
Dharma. I dispel the thoughts and notions of those overpowered by
inappropriate desires, and those whose conduct comes from wrong
thoughts.
35. 16
“I create the conditions for those who have not developed evil thoughts
and bad qualities to not develop them, and for those who think evil thoughts
to eliminate them.
35. 17
“I create in various ways the supporting conditions for those who have
virtuous thoughts, who practice the perfections, who are engaged in good
conduct, who are engaged in accomplishing prayers for the arising of
omniscient wisdom, who are engaged in the ways of love, who are pervaded
by great compassion for beings, who are engaged in creating the various
kinds of happiness of devas and humans, and who have given rise to such
thoughts, [F.94.b] and I create the conditions that support omniscience.
35. 18
“Noble one, I know only the bodhisattva liberation called complete
subjugation through the bliss of the peace of śamatha. How could I know the
conduct or describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who have arisen through
completely good bodhisattva conduct and prayers, who have attained the
wisdom of the infinite realm of phenomena, who have minds that increase all
roots of merit, who have attained illumination of their minds through the
power of the wisdom of all the tathāgatas, who have minds that maintain the
same scope as that of all the tathāgatas, whose minds are unobscured in all
situations, whose minds have perfected the aspiration for omniscience,
whose minds perceive the entire ocean of realms, whose minds are focused
on the vision of the entire ocean of buddhas, whose minds have received the
clouds of the Dharma of all the tathāgatas, who dispel the darkness of
ignorance of all beings, and who have minds that have given rise to the
illumination of omniscience through the path of the final cessation of delight
in and craving for saṃsāra?
35. 19
“Depart, noble one. Here, not far from me, to the south of Vairocana’s
bodhimaṇḍa, there is the goddess of the night named Pramudita nayana-
jagad virocanā. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”


---

35. 20
Then at that time, the night goddess Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā,
[F.95.a] in order to emphasize and teach this bodhisattva liberation called
complete subjugation through the bliss of the peace of śamatha, recited these verses
to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
35. 21
“Those with a mind that aspires to be in the presence
Of the sugatas
 that appear in the three times
1330
Will have a vast and pure eyesight
And will see an ocean of the buddhas. {1}
35. 22
“See the bright, stainless body of the Jina
Beautifully adorned by the signs of a great being!
See the Jina’s miraculous manifestations
That in an instant fill the realm of phenomena! {2}
35. 23
“The Sugata, the perfect Buddha, Vairocana
Is upon the buddha throne under the Bodhi tree.
He pervades the vast realm of phenomena,
Turning the wheel in accordance with the aspirations of beings. {3}
35. 24
“The Jina has realized the true nature, which is bodiless,
Complete peace, nondual, with no own nature.
His physical body, beautiful and adorned by signs,
Pervades and teaches in every world without exception. {4}
35. 25
“The Buddha’s body is inconceivably vast.
It fills the entirety of the realm of phenomena.
It appears equally everywhere,
Revealing all the jinas everywhere. {5}
35. 26
“Bodies of the Buddha, with halos of light,
As numerous as the atoms in all realms,
Their beautiful color appearing here and there,
Fill the realm of phenomena in every instant. {6}
35. 27
“Clouds of light rays appear from the Jina’s pores.
They are vast, inconceivable, and unending.
They fill every world without exception
And dispel the torment of the kleśas in beings. {7}
35. 28
“The Buddha’s inexhaustible ocean of emanations
Appear from the circles of the Jina’s pores [F.95.b]
And spread and fill the vast realm of phenomena,
Dispelling the suffering of beings in the lower realms. {8}


---

35. 29
“The sound of the Buddha’s voice resounds
With the light of an ocean of aspects of speech,
Sending down a great rain of the Dharma,
Causing the aspiration to enlightenment to grow in beings. {9}
35. 30
“He has in the past taken care of those
Practicing bodhisattva conduct during an ocean of kalpas.
They have all seen in all the worlds
The characteristics of the visual form of the Jina Vairocana. {10}
35. 31
“The Tathāgata has appeared in all worlds
In the presence of each and every being
With this and that conduct according to their aspirations,
And those are beyond my ability to know. {11}
35. 32
“All the perfect bodhisattvas without exception
Have appeared from a single pore of the Sugata.
That liberation is inconceivable
And is beyond my ability to know. {12}
35. 33
“This goddess who is nearby to me
Delights in the presence of the Lord of the World.
Her name is Jyotirarci nayanā.
Ask her, what is the practice for enlightenment!” {13}
35. 34
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
night goddess Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā, circumambulated the
night goddess Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from the night goddess Samanta gambhīra śrī vimala prabhā.

Chapter 36
PRAMUDITA NAYANA JAGAD VIROCANĀ
36. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was blessed by the instruction of the
kalyāṇamitra; his mind practiced the words of the kalyāṇamitra; his mind
had the perception of the kalyāṇamitra as a physician and himself as a
patient; [F.96.a] his mind was contented by focusing on the vision of the
kalyāṇamitra; his mind had obtained the opportunity to disperse the
mountain of obscurations to the vision of the kalyāṇamitra; his mind had
attained, through seeing the kalyāṇamitra, entry into the ocean of the ways
of the great compassion that saves all the realms of beings; his mind had
attained, through seeing the kalyāṇamitra, the illumination by wisdom of the
ocean of the ways of the realm of phenomena.
Thus, he approached the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā.
36. 2
The night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā, in order to further
increase the ripening of his accumulation of the roots of merit through
approaching a kalyāṇamitra, blessed approaching a kalyāṇamitra as arising
from a great accumulation, blessed going to a kalyāṇamitra as great prowess,
blessed approaching a kalyāṇamitra as diligence in actions that is difficult to
realize, blessed approaching a kalyāṇamitra as reliance
 throughout a
long time, blessed approaching a kalyāṇamitra as going into centerless and
limitless directions, blessed approaching a kalyāṇamitra as the source for
dwelling together for a long time, blessed approaching a kalyāṇamitra as the
source of perceiving infinite tasks being completed, blessed approaching a
kalyāṇamitra as the prowess of an accumulation of centerless and limitless
displays of the path, blessed approaching a kalyāṇamitra as prowess
through every gateway, [F.96.b] and blessed approaching a kalyāṇamitra as
the prowess of undeviating arrival.
1331
36. 3
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the night goddess
Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā in this way: approaching a kalyāṇamitra
with diligent dedication in the accumulation of omniscience; approaching a


---

kalyāṇamitra with the prowess of accomplishing an ocean of great prayers;
approaching a kalyāṇamitra with the resolve to undergo suffering for the
sake of a single being until the conclusion of the last future kalpa;
approaching a kalyāṇamitra with the prowess of remaining for a long
time
 within a single atom, emitting sound
 throughout the entire realm
of phenomena while wearing the armor of diligence; approaching a
kalyāṇamitra while moving at great speed through the entire extent of the
ocean of directions; approaching a kalyāṇamitra while maintaining all
bodhisattva conduct of future kalpas in a single pore of the body;
approaching a kalyāṇamitra with the attainment of bodhisattva conduct and
in each instant of mind dwelling in omniscient wisdom; approaching a
kalyāṇamitra while intent on following the path and the display of miracles
of the tathāgatas of the three times; approaching a kalyāṇamitra while
following the path of entering the stream of all the ways of the realm of
phenomena; and approaching a kalyāṇamitra without deviating from being
focused on all the ways of the realm of phenomena and pervading the entire
realm of phenomena. [F.97.a]
1332
1333
36. 4
He saw the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā seated on a
flower in the center of a lion throne within the circle of the assembly of the
Bhagavat, resting in the bodhisattva samādhi called the banner of the power of
vast, stainless, completely good joy.
36. 5
He saw emanating from all her pores clouds of manifestations of the
practice of the perfections, such as generosity, which delighted all beings,
which brought pleasure to all beings, and which were various kinds of
beauty for all beings.
36. 6
They were like this: he saw clouds of manifestations of the practice of
generosity in accord with the aspirations, perceptions, and languages of all
beings, in order to benefit beings without causing discord, in order for there
to be no concern for all material things, in order to give equally to all beings,
in order for there to be impartiality toward all beings, in order to give
respectfully to all beings, in order to give all inner and outer things, in order
to manifest the generosity that is difficult,
 and in order to manifest in all
worlds the practice of generosity according to the wishes of beings.
1334
36. 7
He saw clouds of manifestations of the countless difficult acts of
generosity by the bodhisattvas that appear in the three times, [F.97.b] which
being emanated were perceived by all beings within the vast extent of the
worlds in the ten directions.
36. 8
It was like this: because of her attainment of the inconceivable miraculous
powers of the might of bodhisattvas, he saw, issuing forth from all her pores,
clouds of emanated bodies of various beings, equal in number to that of all
beings, which spread throughout all beings within all world realms,


---

demonstrating directly to them the unwavering commitment to vows of
discipline; demonstrating throughout the realms of beings the field of the
various vows of discipline of
 asceticism; demonstrating nondependence
on all worlds, no concern for all fields of perception, and the rejection of all
locations in saṃsāra; demonstrating entering the gateway to the decline of
the good fortune of devas and humans;

36. 9
He saw, issuing forth from all her pores, clouds of emanated bodies of
various colors, which were as numerous as all beings, teaching the
endurance by all beings of the major and minor parts of their bodies being
cut off; teaching the endurance by all beings of harm to their bodies;

reproached, disgraced, and threatened; teaching the imperturbability of all

unceasing wisdom of the unceasing patience toward the nature of all
phenomena; teaching the practice of patience that eliminates the kleśas in all
beings; turning all beings away from misshapen bodies with ugly color;

1339
36. 10
He saw, issuing forth from all her pores, clouds of emanated bodies of
various colors, shapes, and sizes, equal in number to that of all beings, which
spread everywhere in accordance with the aspirations of beings, teaching
exertion in diligence for the great accumulation of omniscience; [F.98.b] the
diligence that puts to flight all discord from the māras; the diligence that is
constant and unwavering in undertaking the attainment of enlightenment;
the diligence for rescuing all beings from the ocean of saṃsāra; the diligence
that turns beings away from all the paths that lead to unfortunate existences,
calamitous existences, terrible existences, and downfalls; the diligence for

beings; prevented unhappiness; condemned all delights in desire;
proclaimed in the world the quality of a sense of shame; brought beings to
control of their senses; praised the unsurpassable conduct of celibacy; taught
the fearfulness of the world of desire and the realm of Māra; taught all the

wishes of all beings within all realms, demonstrating unwearyingly going
into the presence of kalyāṇamitras;
 demonstrating unwearying service

He saw, issuing forth from all her pores, clouds of emanated bodies, as

 the mind, [F.101.b] creating a faultless mind, clarifying the
senses, creating the power of aspiration, and causing irreversible progress
toward omniscience.
1352

1371
36. 33
He saw them declaring it, elucidating it, revealing it, communicating it,
categorizing it, expanding upon it, enumerating it, giving instruction on it,
making it known, and accomplishing it.


---

36. 34
He saw some teaching the Dharma through speech from the sound of
shaking in a domain of wind, [F.106.a] some through speech from the sound
of crashing waves on a mass of water, some through speech from the sound
of the roaring flames of a fire, some through speech from the sound of a
roaring ocean, some through speech from the sound of the rumbling of an
earthquake, some through speech from the sound and noise of great
mountains striking against and buffeting one another, some through speech

through speech sounding from precious jewels,
 and some through the
speech of all the various classes of beings, describing to beings the scope of
the liberation of the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā.
1372
36. 35
In the same way, he saw clouds of bodhisattva bodies with various kinds
of bodhisattva speech and clouds of emanated
 tathāgatas, with the ways
of the aspects of voice of the different kinds of speech of each tathāgata and
describing to all beings the range of the liberation of the night goddess
Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā, including the first occurrence of developing
the aspiration to enlightenment and the accumulation of accomplishments.
[F.106.b]
1373
36. 36
He saw that each of those clouds of emanated forms purified, in each
instant of mind, an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms in the world
realms in the ten directions.
36. 37
He saw them liberating
 an infinite ocean of beings from all the
sufferings of the lower realms.

36. 39
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw them bringing, in each instant of
mind, an ocean of beings, without limit or center, to the level of the ten
strengths.
36. 40
He heard them, contemplated them, scrutinized them, comprehended
them, understood them, knew them, followed them, fathomed them, and was
resolved as to their equality.
36. 41
This was because of the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā’s
having become an appropriate vessel for the completely good bodhisattva
conduct, her supremacy through the miracles of the bodhisattva liberation
called the vast banner
 of inconceivable, completely good joy, her corresponding
practice in the past, her being blessed by the blessings of the tathāgatas, and
the ripening of her countless roots of merit.
1376
36. 42
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, who had attained the
illumination of an ocean of the power of great bodhisattva joy, who had been
blessed by all the tathāgatas in the ten directions, [F.107.a] placed his hands
together in homage and praised the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad-
virocanā with these appropriate verses:
36. 43
“The Dharma
 of the jinas is profound.
1377
You trained in it for countless kalpas.
In successive forms that accord with dispositions,
You pervade all beings and appear in worlds. {1}
36. 44
“Knowing that they have no self and no protector,
Have incorrect conceptions, and are continually deluded,
You guide beings by manifesting bodies and powers
Through various kinds of miracles. {2}
36. 45
“Completely free from fevers, in perfect peace,
You have a pure, nondual Dharma body.
You guide through the thunder of clouds of emanations
All beings, without exception, who are dependent on duality. {3}
36. 46
“You are never dependent, never reliant
On the skandhas, āyatanas, and dhātus.
You have a perfect form with all limbs complete,
And you guide with your roar of supremacy. {4}
36. 47
“You are liberated internally and externally.
You have risen above the ocean of duality,
Yet you manifest illusory forms for beings
In the infinite ocean of saṃsāra. {5}
36. 48
“You do not vacillate.


---

You are not complicated by pride or hurry.
You teach the nature of phenomena
And guide the fools in the world who delight in complication. {6}
36. 49
“Through remaining in an ocean of samādhis,
Your mind is one-pointed for many kalpas,
Yet you emit clouds of emanations from your pores
So as to make offerings to the sugatas in the ten directions. {7}
36. 50
“In every single instant of mind, you comprehend
The ways of entering into the strengths of the buddhas.
According to individual circumstances, you manifest
The undertakings that will gather beings
 around you. {8} [F.107.b]
1378
36. 51
“You see the oceans of existence
And the various forms painted by karma.
You purify all beings by showing them
The unobscured path of the Dharma. {9}
36. 52
“Your body is beautified by the signs of a great being,
But through the pure, perfectly good conduct,
You manifest in the world the form of a goddess
In accordance with the dispositions of beings.” {10}
36. 53
Having praised the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā with
those verses, Sudhana asked, “Goddess, how long has it been since you
entered into attaining the highest, complete enlightenment? Goddess, how
long has it been since you attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
banner of the power of vast, stainless, completely good joy?”
36. 54
The night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā recited these verses to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
36. 55
“I remember, in the past, as many kalpas ago
As there are atoms in a realm,
There was the realm Maṇi prabha sukhābha
In a kalpa called Praśantaghoṣa. {11}
36. 56
“It was filled with ten thousand quintillion1379
Four-continent world realms.
The central four-continent world, beautifully formed,
Resembled a measureless mountain of jewels. {12}
36. 57
“It was filled by the king’s cities
Numbering ten thousand quintillion.1380


---

The beautiful central royal city,
Gandhadhvajā, shone with jewels.
 {13}
1381
36. 58
“There a lord of the directions, sovereign of the land,
A cakravartin with a handsome body, appeared.
He had the thirty-two signs of a great being,
And the features of a great being also adorned his body. {14}
36. 59
“He was miraculously born from inside a lotus.
His body was golden and shone with light. [F.108.a]
He moved through the sky and filled with light
The entirety of Jambudhvaja. {15}
36. 60
“He had a full thousand sons,
All of whom had bodies with excellent limbs.
He had many millions of ministers
Who were wise, intelligent, learned, and honest. {16}
36. 61
“He had a full hundred million queens
Who resembled apsarases, were skilled in the art of pleasure,
And with loving minds, caring minds,1382
Affectionately attended that king. {17}
36. 62
“That king, through the power of the Dharma,
Caused that great land, the entirety of the four continents
As far as the Cakravāla mountain range,1383
To remain in a state of good fortune. {18}
36. 63
“I was that cakravartin’s principal
 queen.
1384
I had the voice of Brahmā and a bejeweled
 body,
1385
With a bright halo the color of gold
That illuminated for a thousand yojanas. {19}
36. 64
“After the sun had set
And the king and his sons were asleep
And the sound of music had ceased,
I slept comfortably on my bed. {20}
36. 65
“In the middle of the night,
The Buddha Śrisamudra appeared.
The Jina manifested limitless
 miracles
1386
That spread throughout the ten directions. {21}
36. 66
“That ocean of the Jina’s light
Spread through worlds as numerous a realm’s atoms.


---

Various kinds of emanated bodies
Filled all ten directions without exception. {22}
36. 67
“The earth and its mountains shook,
And a voice proclaimed, ‘A jina has come!’
Devas, asuras, humans, and nāgas
Were all delighted that a buddha had appeared. {23}
36. 68
“Many oceans of emanations appeared
From all the pores of the Buddha.
They spread throughout the ten directions
And taught the Dharma in accordance with the aspirations of beings. {24}
36. 69
“The Jina revealed to me in a dream
All those limitless miraculous manifestations. [F.108.b]
When I heard the profound thunderous sound,
I understood its meaning and was delighted. {25}
36. 70
“Ten
 thousand night goddesses
1387
Residing in the sky above me
Spoke to me, waking me from sleep,
Praising the excellence of the Jina. {26}
36. 71
“ ‘Arise, wise queen of His Majesty,
A jina has appeared in your kingdom.
This kind of good fortune is difficult to find1388
Even in a hundred oceans of kalpas.’ {27}
36. 72
“I awoke with happiness
And saw the clear, pure light.
I looked to see where this good light came from
And saw the Jina at the foot of the Bodhi tree. {28}
36. 73
“He was adorned by the thirty-two signs of a great being,
And an ocean of light rays shone from all his pores.
Just like Sumeru he was above all,
And the Jina was the same on the right and the left. {29}
36. 74
“When I saw him I was overjoyed,
And in my mind rose the aspiration to be like him.
Having seen the manifestations of the Buddha,
I made a very vast prayer. {30}
36. 75
“I requested the king to arise,
And his court and his wives also got up.


---

When they saw the vast light from the Buddha,
They all experienced physical pleasure. {31}
36. 76
“I proceeded to the presence of the Jina
Together with the king and his armed forces
And accompanied by ten million carriages1389
And many quintillions
 of beings. {32}
1390
36. 77
“For twenty thousand years
I made offerings to the Jina.
I presented him
 with the seven jewels
1391
And the earth and its oceans. {33}
36. 78
“The clouds of the qualities of an ocean of sūtras,
Which were a display arisen from an ocean of prayers,
Had all appeared from the Tathāgata
And were taught to beings according to their dispositions. {34}
36. 79
“Those night goddesses,
 wishing to benefit
 me,
1392
1393
With compassion woke me at that time.
 [F.109.a]
1394
There arose an aspiration in me toward them:1395
‘May I become like them, awakening the intoxicated.’
 {35}
1396
36. 80
“That was the prayer that I made in my mind,
My first development of the aspiration for the highest enlightenment,
Which my residing in the ocean of saṃsāra,
The ocean of existences, has not destroyed. {36}
36. 81
“I had faith in and offered to
Ten
 million trillion buddhas.
1397
While in the midst of saṃsāra’s devas and humans,
I desired the scope of pleasure and bliss. {37}

“The first was Śrīsamudra.
After him came Guṇa pradīpa.
The third was the Jina Ratnaketu.
The fourth was the Buddha Gagana prajña. {38}

“The fifth jina was Kusumagarbha.
The sixth jina was Asaṅga mati candra.
The seventh jina was Dharma candra prabhu rāja.
The eighth was Jñāna maṇḍala prabhāsa. {39}
36. 84
“Then came the time of the ninth jina,
Racanārci parvata pradīpa.1398

The tenth was Tryadhva prabha ghoṣa.
With faith, I made offerings to them all. {40}
36. 85
“I made offerings to those ten
And all the other lords of humans.
But I did not at that time attain
The vision of entering the ocean of ways. {41}
36. 86
“After that there followed the realm
That was called Sarvaratnābha
In the kalpa called Devaśrī,
In which five hundred buddhas appeared. {42}
36. 87
“The first was Śaśimaṇḍala.
The second born was Bhāskara pradīpa.
The third buddha was Jyotidhvaja,
And after him there were Maṇisumeru, {43}

“Kusumārci sāgara pradīpa,
Jvalanaśrīśa, Devaśrīgarbha,
Avabhāsa rāja, and Prabha ketu.
The tenth was Samanta jñāna prabha rāja. {44}
36. 89
“I made offerings to those ten
And all the rest of those lords of humans.
But I delighted
 in being located in the body.
1399
I had a mind dwelling in the Dharma that has no location. {45}
36. 90
“Following that, there was [F.109.b]
The beautiful world realm
Called Dharma pradīpa megha śrī
In the kalpa called Brahmaprabha. {46}
36. 91
“In that there were countless jinas.
I made offerings to them and their followers.
From all of those sugatas1400

“The first jina was Ratnameru.
After him were Guṇa samudra

And after them
 was Meghaśrī. {49}

“I made offerings to those ten
And all the rest of those lords of humans.

 the true nature

“After that came the Sugata1403
Sūrya pradīpa ketu śrī
In a realm called Buddhamati,
In a kalpa called Somaśrī. {51}
36. 96
“I made offerings to all eight hundred million1404
Of those with the ten strengths who were present there,
With a variety of limitless, vast,
Numerous beautiful offerings.

“The first after him
 was Gandharva rāja,

36. 99
“I made offerings to those ten
And all the rest of those sugatas.
But I did not attain the knowledge
That comprehended that ocean of Dharma. {55}
36. 100
“After that, there was a perfectly pure realm
Called Vajra māṇyabhedyadṛḍha tejas,1408
In which there were constant clouds of light
And the presence of numerous beautiful displays. {56}
36. 101
“Within it there were many pure beings
With few afflictions from the stains of kleśas. [F.110.a]
The kalpa was called Praśānta mati tejas
With the display of the appearance of a thousand buddhas. {57}
36. 102
“The first jina was Vajranābhi,
The second was Asaṅga bala dhārin,

“But I did not realize
 this nature of phenomena,
1409
The pure nature that is the same as space,
In which one should remain while practicing
In the entire vast extent of realms. {61}
36. 106
“After that, there was the beautiful realm
Called Gandha pradīpa megha śrī,
Completely purified of all the kleśas,
In the kalpa that was called Susaṃbhava. {62}
36. 107
“During that time there appeared ten million jinas
Who were all arrayed throughout that kalpa.1410
Those guides taught the Dharma,
And I retained it through the power of memory. {63}
36. 108
“The first jina was Vipulakīrti,
Then there were Dharma samudra vega śrī rāja,
Dharmendrarāja, Guṇa ghoṣa,
Dharmaśrī, and Devamakuṭa; {64}

“Jñānārci teja śrī was the seventh
Of those lords of two-legged beings.

“The buddha that came after them
Was Ūrṇa śrī prabhāsa mati.
I made offerings to all those lords of humans,
But I did not purify the path free of attachment. {66}
36. 111
“After that there was the well-arranged world realm
Called Ratna dhvajāgra mati,

Which was an excellent display
Formed from all kinds of jewels. {67} [F.110.b]
36. 112
“During that kalpa, called Sārocaya,
There appeared five hundred buddhas.
I made offerings to all those self-arisen ones,
Wishing for this liberation free of attachment.

“The first was named Guṇa maṇḍala,

“All the jinas have followed
The purifying path of the jinas.
However, I had still not attained
The patience for entering this way of the jinas. {71}

World realm of very beautiful lights
Called Śānta nirghoṣa hāra mati,1416
Where dwelled beings with few kleśas. {72}

“In that kalpa called Sukhābhirati

The lord of two-legged beings, set forth,
I was the goddess Śaśivakra,

36. 129
“That jina
 proclaimed
 to me
1419
1420
Sūtras that were displays without location,


---

Displays that arose from an ocean of prayers,
Which I heard and retained through the power of memory. {85}
36. 130
“I attained at that time vast vision,
Samādhis, and the power of retention.
In each instant I saw oceans of jinas
And a succession of realms. {86}
36. 131
“There arose in me the essence of compassion,
The completely illuminating clouds of the way of kindness,
The aspiration to enlightenment, as vast as space,
And the vast beauty of the immeasurable buddha strengths.
 {87} [F.111.b]
1421
36. 132
“I saw beings who were in a state of delusion,
Attached to permanence, happiness, purity, and self,1422
Blinded
 by stupidity, obscured by ignorance,
1423
Disturbed by the kleśas, and having misperceptions. {88}
36. 133
“They performed actions in a thicket of wrong views,
Following frightening paths
 under the power of craving.
1424
Many various forms appearing
Were painted
 by karma. {89}
1425
36. 134
“Those who appeared through being born
Through the gateways to rebirth in all existences
Had bodies and minds that experienced
The torments of birth, aging, and death. {90}
36. 135
“Seeing that, in order to bring them benefit and happiness
I developed the supreme motivation
Wherever those with the ten strengths appeared,
Anywhere throughout the vast extent of realms. {91}
36. 136
“From that arose clouds of prayers,
Perfect dedication to the happiness of beings,
The arising of limitless accumulations,
And the understanding of the ways of an ocean of paths. {92}
36. 137
“I obtained vast clouds of practices,
The power of clear gateways to all paths,
Vast clouds of the perfections,
And the opening of the entire extent of the realm of Dharma. {93}
36. 138
“With the vast power to ascend the bhūmis,
Practicing without attachment on the bhūmis,


---

In the ways of the ocean of the three times,
In each instant I came into the presence of all jinas. {94}
36. 139
“What is more, I also mastered
The completely good jinaputra
 conduct,
1426
And I realized the ways of the ocean
Of the ten aspects of the realm of the Dharma. {95}
36. 140
“Noble one, do you think that the cakravartin king, that sovereign, who at
that time, in that time, [F.112.a] was established in the unbroken lineage of
the family of the buddhas is anyone else? Noble one, do not see him in that
way. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was at that time, in that time, that king, that
sovereign, who was the cakravartin, established in the unbroken lineage of
the family of the buddhas. The night goddess who awoke me was an
emanation of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra.
36. 141
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that Bhadramati, the precious
woman who was the queen of the cakravartin in that time, at that time, was
anyone else, do not see her in that way. At that time, in that time, I was
Bhadramati, the precious woman who was the queen of the cakravartin. I
was awoken by that night goddess and inspired by her to go see the
Buddha.
36. 142
“Noble one, I developed in that one existence the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment. In that way, through the power of that
development of aspiration, I have, throughout kalpas as numerous as the
atoms in a buddha realm, never fallen into rebirth in the lower realms but
have always continuously depended on existence as a human or deva, and
in all those existences I have seen tathāgatas. Finally, through just seeing
the Bhagavat Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Ratna śrī pradīpa guṇa ketu,
 I
attained the bodhisattva liberation called the banner of the power
 of vast,
stainless, completely good joy. When I had attained it, I took on this kind of form
in order to ripen and guide beings.
1427
1428
36. 143
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the banner of the
power
 of vast, stainless, completely good joy. How could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who, at the feet of all the tathāgatas
[F.112.b] in each instant of mind, attain a great ocean of the power for setting
out upon omniscience; who, in each instant of mind, have completed the
attainment of an ocean of great prayers within all the entrances for setting
out upon omniscience; who, in each instant of mind, are skilled, through the
ways of making an ocean of prayers, in accomplishing a domain of conduct
in future kalpas; who are skilled in accomplishing, within each conduct, as
many bodies as there are atoms in all buddha realms; who are skilled in
pervading, with each body, the entire ocean of different ways in the realm of
1429

phenomena; who are skilled in manifesting, in each ocean of different ways
in the realm of phenomena, a perceivable conduct of the body that accords
with the dispositions of beings throughout all the buddha realms; who are
skilled in comprehending, in each ocean of different ways in the realm of
phenomena, an ocean of tathāgatas, without limit or center, within all the
atoms of a realm in all realms; who are skilled in comprehending each
tathāgata’s miraculous tathāgata manifestations that pervade the entire
extent of the realm of phenomena; who are skilled in comprehending each
tathāgata’s accomplishment of gathering the accumulation of bodhisattva
conduct in past kalpas; who are skilled in obtaining and possessing each
tathāgata’s vast
 wheel of the Dharma; and who are skilled in
comprehending the ocean of the different ways of miraculous manifestations
by the tathāgatas in the three times?
1430
36. 144
“Depart, noble one. In this circle of the Tathāgata’s assembly, not far from
me, there is the goddess of the night named Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī.
[F.113.a] Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
36. 145
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā, circumambulated the night
goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā. [B7]

Chapter 37
SAMANTA SATTVA TRĀṆOJAḤ ŚRĪ
37. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, aspiring to the night goddess
Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā’s samādhi of the bodhisattva liberation
called the banner of the power
 of vast, stainless, completely good joy,
comprehending it, understanding it, knowing it, believing in it, undertaking
it, pervading it, recollecting it, remembering it, and meditating on it,
practicing the instruction of the kalyāṇamitra and memorizing the
instruction given by the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā in
order to maintain the continuity of the teaching of instruction, approached
the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī. Through contemplating
seeing a kalyāṇamitra, through the domain of all his faculties,
 by going
from place to place
 to obtain the sight of a kalyāṇamitra, through looking
in all directions, through being intent on searching for a kalyāṇamitra,
through being free from all pride, [F.113.b] through the prowess
 of
pleasing a kalyāṇamitra, through being resolved to create a great
accumulation of merit, through having become single-mindedly intent upon
a kalyāṇamitra,
 and through all his roots of merit,
 he had gained the
unwavering motivation for a kalyāṇamitra’s conduct of skillful methods, had
developed an ocean of the power of diligence for increasing reliance on a
kalyāṇamitra, and had prayed to dwell with and follow kalyāṇamitras
equally in all kalpas.
1431
1432
1433
1434
1435
1436
1437
1438
37. 2
As he approached her, the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, in
order to demonstrate the supreme might of the limitless bodhisattva
liberation called the manifestations that guide beings that appear in all worlds,
revealed her body, which had the complete beautiful signs and features of a
great being. She then radiated from her ūrṇā hair a ray of light called the
banner of stainless light that is a lamp of the complete radiance of wisdom,


---

accompanied by light rays without end or center. They illuminated all worlds
and then descended into the crown of the head of Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, and spread throughout his entire body.
37. 3
As soon as Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was touched by those light
rays, he instantly attained the samādhi called the area that is completely free of
particles.1439
37. 4
Because he had attained that, he saw the area of ground that was the route
between the night goddess Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā and the night
goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī as being made of atoms of fire; or atoms
of water; or atoms of earth; or atoms of diamond; or atoms of various great
kings of precious jewels; or atoms of flowers, incense, and powders; [F.114.a]
or atoms of all precious arrays; or atoms of all locations. In each atom there
were world realms as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm.
37. 5
He saw that they had aggregations of water, had aggregations of fire, had
aggregations of air, had aggregations of earth, had world-realm
boundaries,
 had bases, had foundations, had different shapes, had
surfaces of various kinds of different forms, had different kinds of encircling
mountains, had various kinds of encircling oceans, had arrays of various
kinds of buildings made of divine materials, had various kinds of trees, had
various adornments in the sky, had the adornment of the buildings of the
cities of devas, had the adornment of the buildings of the cities of nāgas, had
the adornment of the buildings of the cities of yakṣas, had the adornment of
the buildings of the cities of gandharvas, had the adornment of the buildings
of the cities of the asuras, had the adornment of the buildings of the cities of
garuḍas, had the adornment of the buildings of the cities of kinnaras, had
the adornment of the buildings of the cities of mahoragas, had the
adornment of the buildings of the cities of humans, had the adornment of the
buildings of the cities of all beings in the main and intermediate directions,
had the realm of the world of hells, had the realm of the world of animals,
had the realm of the world of Yama, had the realm of the death and rebirth of
humans and nonhumans,
 had various kinds of births, and had the
accumulation and destruction of various kinds of existences.
1440
1441
37. 6
He saw various kinds of differences between those worlds: he saw some
worlds that were defiled, [F.114.b] some that were pure, some that were
completely defiled, some that were purified of ordinary existences, some that
were purified of defilements, some that were both pure and defiled, some
that were completely pure, some that were a flat surface, some that were
upside-down, and some that were disordered, and he saw how in all the
existences of beings, in all the births of beings in those world realms, the
night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī became present for all those beings
in order to guide them according to their circumstances.


---

37. 7
He saw her becoming present separately for every being in order to ripen
and guide them in accordance with their lifespans; the various scopes of
their aspirations; the forms of their bodies; their languages, terminology, and
established definitions; the forms of their practices; and their dominance.
37. 8
This means that he saw her becoming present separately for every being
in order to dispel the fear of the various sufferings of hell for the beings who
were in hell existences; in order to dispel in beings among the various
animals the fear of being eaten by one another; in order to dispel the fear of
the suffering of hunger, thirst, and so on for beings within Yama’s realm; in
order to dispel all fear of the suffering of nāgas for those in nāga existences;
[F.115.a] in order to dispel all fear of the sufferings of the desire realm for all
beings within the desire realms; in order to dispel in those who existed in the
human world all fear of being bewildered in the darkness of night; in order
to dispel the fear of blame and infamy for those who were preoccupied with
criticism, blame, and infamy; in order to dispel the fear of anxiety before an
assembly for those beings who had the fear of anxiety before an assembly; in
order to dispel the fear of death in those beings who were frightened and
terrified of death; in order to dispel the fear of the abyss of the lower
existences for those beings who were frightened and terrified of the abyss of
the lower realms; in order to dispel the fear of having no livelihood for those
beings who were frightened and terrified of having no livelihood; in order to
dispel the fear of the loss of their roots of merit for those beings who were
frightened of losing their roots of merit; in order to dispel the fear of a
diminution of the aspiration for enlightenment for those beings who were
afraid of a diminution of their aspiration for enlightenment; in order to dispel
the fear of meeting bad companions for those beings who were frightened of
meeting bad companions; in order to dispel the fear of separation from
kalyāṇamitras in those beings who were frightened of separation from
kalyāṇamitras; [F.115.b] in order to dispel the fear of falling to the level of
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas in those beings who were frightened of
falling to the level of śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas; in order to dispel the
fear of the various kinds of suffering in saṃsāra for those beings who were
afraid of the various kinds of suffering in saṃsāra; in order to dispel the fear
of meeting contrary beings for those beings who were frightened and afraid
of meeting contrary beings; in order to dispel the fear of unfortunate times in
those beings who were frightened and afraid of unfortunate times; in order
to dispel the fear of rebirth into unfortunate families in those beings who
were frightened and afraid of rebirth into unfortunate families; in order to
dispel the fear of committing bad actions for those beings who were
frightened and afraid of committing bad actions; in order to dispel the fear of
the obscurations of karma and kleśas for those beings who were frightened


---

and afraid of the obscurations of karma and kleśas; and in order to dispel the
fear of the bondage of remaining fixed in a variety of conceptions for those
beings who were frightened and afraid of remaining fixed in a variety of
conceptions.
37. 9
This means he saw her, being present in and purifying all realms, through
possessing the supremacy of the vast miraculous powers of bodhisattva
liberation and through the accomplishment of the power of the prayer to
protect all beings: beings born from eggs, born from wombs, born from warm
moisture, born spontaneously, and with form, without form, with perception,
without perception, and neither with perception nor without perception;
through the vast prowess of the power of bodhisattva samādhi; [F.116.a]
through the power of the great higher cognitions of a bodhisattva; through
the power of attaining the completely good conduct and prayer of a
bodhisattva; and through developing the power of an ocean of the ways of
compassion; in order to spread everywhere the great love for all beings that
is free of attachment; in order to create happiness for all beings and increase
the power of their joy; and so that all beings will accomplish the
accumulation of wisdom.
1442
37. 10
He saw her focused on knowing the knowledge of all Dharmas; being
present there focused on making offerings and honoring all buddhas;
focused on holding the teachings of all the tathāgatas; focused on the
accumulation of all roots of merit; focused on the increase of all bodhisattva
conduct; focused on the minds of all beings being free of obscurations;
focused on ripening the faculties of all beings; focused on purifying the
ocean of the aspirations of all beings; focused on dispelling obscuring
qualities in all beings; focused on dispersing the darkness of ignorance in all
beings;
 and focused on creating the light of omniscient wisdom. [F.116.b]
1443
37. 11
When Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had seen this miraculous
prowess of the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī’s inconceivable
bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that guide beings that appear in all
worlds, he was overjoyed and acquired an ocean of the power of great
delight.
37. 12
He prostrated with his entire body before the night goddess Samanta-
sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī and then stood and gazed upon
 her.
1444
37. 13
Then the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī made her appearance in
the pure form and physical signs of a bodhisattva vanish, and she remained
in the form of a night goddess emanating all miraculous manifestations.
37. 14
At that time, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, standing with hands
together in homage before the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī,
recited these verses to her:
37. 15
“I have seen your vast
 body
1445


---

Adorned by the excellent, beautiful signs1446
And the wonderful special features,
Like the sky adorned by stars. {1}
37. 16
“Your perfect, beautiful body’s halo of light rays
As numerous as the atoms in infinite realms,
With its multicolored, incomparable
 radiance,
1447
Spreads throughout the extent of every direction. {2}
37. 17
“From the pores of your body shine
As many networks of light rays as there are minds of beings.
At the tip of each light ray an emanation of yours,
Seated upon a beautiful lotus, eliminates the sufferings of beings. {3}
37. 18
“Clouds of incense mists are emitted,
Taking on the forms of beautiful beings.
Flowers spread out everywhere [F.117.a]
To all the jinas in the realm of phenomena. {4}

“The vast, sublime mass of your shoulders1448
Shines with stainless jewel light, the size of Mount Meru,
With which you illuminate all beings,
Dispelling the darkness of ignorance. {5}

“Vast masses of clouds of suns
 are emanated
1449
From your beautifully colored, stainless
 face.
1450
Your wonderful light, which is like the disk of the sun,
Is emanated throughout Vairocana’s vast field of activity. {6}

“Clouds of the stainless light of the moon and the stars
Are constantly emanated from your eyes.
They spread throughout the ten directions,
Illuminating beings and eliminating the world’s blindness. {7}

I approached you contemplating good qualities.
At that time a beautiful, stainless mass of light rays
Radiated from between your eyebrows. {10}
37. 25
“They illuminated hundreds of oceans of directions
And created a vast radiance in the world.
They revealed many miraculous manifestations,
And at that time they entered into my body. {11}
37. 26
“When that mass of light touched me,
At that time I experienced a marvelous bliss.
I gained mastery of many hundreds of dhāraṇīs and samādhis,
And I saw limitless jinas in the ten directions. {12}
37. 27
“Wherever I stepped with my feet
I could perceive the number of atoms there,
And I saw in every single atom
Realms as numerous as a realm’s atoms. {13} [F.117.b]
37. 28
“There were many hundreds of defiled realms
Of many different kinds, located in atoms
In which beings experienced suffering,
Crying out with the sounds of lamentation and wailing. {14}
37. 29
“There were also many realms both defiled and pure,
In which there was much suffering and little happiness,
In which the compassionate jinas took birth,
As did the jinas’ śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas.

1452
37. 30
“There were some realms, purified of defilements,
That were ornamented by the presence of many bodhisattvas
And adorned by beautiful men and women,
And the brilliant family of the jinas resided there. {16}

“There were vast, stainless oceans of realms,
With level surfaces, that were located in atoms,

Vairocana purified his conduct in the past. {17}

“Within that entire vast extent of realms,
Jinas were revealed going to the lord of trees,
Attaining enlightenment, manifesting miracles,

When Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had recited those verses, he said to
the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, “Goddess, that profound
bodhisattva liberation is a great wonder. What is the name of that liberation?
How long ago did you attain it? How does a bodhisattva practice in order to
purify that bodhisattva liberation?”
37. 35
The night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī said, “Noble one, this subject
is difficult to believe in for the world and its devas, as well as for the
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas. Why is that? Because it is the field of
practice of those bodhisattvas who follow the completely good conduct and
prayer of the bodhisattvas; [F.118.a] who are dedicated to the essence of
compassion; who are engaged in saving all beings; who purify the paths that
lead to all unfortunate and lower realms; who purify all realms to become the
highest buddha realms; who create the unbroken continuity of the Buddha’s
family in all buddha realms; who hold the teachings of all the buddhas; who
have oceans of great prayers for remaining in the practice of bodhisattva
conduct throughout all kalpas; and who create the pure light of wisdom, free
of darkness, for all the oceans of Dharma; and those bodhisattvas who in
each instant have attained the state of remaining in the light of wisdom of
the entire ocean of the ways of the three times. However, through the
blessing of the Tathāgata, I will teach it.
37. 36
“Noble one, in the past beyond kalpas as numerous as the atoms in a
buddha realm, there was a world realm called Vairocana tejaḥśrī during a
kalpa called Virajomaṇḍala. In that kalpa there appeared as many buddhas
as there are atoms in Sumeru. In that world realm called Vairocana tejaḥśrī
there was an array of clouds of all jewels, and it was beautified by aerial
palaces made of diamonds.
37. 37
“That world realm was situated on a foundation of an ocean of the kings
of jewels possessing stainless light. Its solid body
 was formed from
precious jewels possessing all the kings of perfumes. It was completely
round in shape. It was both pure and defiled. It was covered by a canopy of
clouds of every adornment. [F.118.b] It had the array of a thousand precious
Cakravāla mountains. It was adorned by a quintillion four-continent worlds.
Some four-continent worlds were defiled and were the dwelling places of
beings who had defiled karma. Some were the dwelling places of beings
who had a mixture
 of both defiled and pure karma. Some were the
dwelling places of beings who were pure and also defiled, who had pure
good actions and few blameworthy actions. Some were the dwelling places
of pure bodhisattvas.
1453

37. 38
“To the east of the world realm Vairocana tejaḥśrī, next to the Cakravāla
mountains, there was a four-continent world called Ratna kusuma pradīpa-
dhvajā. It was pure but defiled. There beings enjoyed the unplowed harvests.
They lived in kūṭāgāras and aerial palaces that were created by the ripening
of their past karma. It was encircled by wish-fulfilling trees. There were
various kinds of aromatic trees that continually released clouds of perfume.
There were various kinds of garland trees that continually released clouds of
garlands. There were various kinds of flowering trees from which fell a
continuous rain of clouds of flowers with inconceivable colors and scents.
There were various kinds of colored-powder trees from which fell a
continuous rain of the powders of all the kings of precious scents. There
were various kinds of jewel trees from which fell many jewel seed-pods
that shone with various colors. [F.119.a] There were trees of various kinds of
divine music from which were emanated clouds of the sound of music. From
the sky came melodious sounds. Day and night, there was the pleasant light
of the sun and moon. The ground, which shone with all precious jewels, was
level.
1455
37. 39
“In those four continents there were a quintillion royal cities. Each of
those royal cities was encircled by a thousand rivers. All those rivers were
filled with the petals of divine flowers. They emitted the melodious, beautiful
sounds of divine music and song. Their banks were adorned by beautiful
precious trees. Boats adorned by various jewels crossed back and forth.
Every kind of happiness that could be delighted in was enjoyed there. In
between each river a quintillion towns had been established. Each of those
towns was encircled by a quintillion markets. All those villages, cities, and
markets were encircled by a quintillion divine parks, aerial palaces, and
mansions. In the center of the Jambudvīpa of that four-continent world was
the central royal city, which was called Ratna kusuma pradīpā.
37. 40
“This was a place that was prosperous and wealthy, with an abundance of
food;
 it had every kind of happiness and was filled with many devas and
humans, and the beings there followed the path of the ten good actions.
[F.119.b]
1456
37. 41
“Here dwelled King Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa, a cakravartin
who was sovereign over the four continents. He had been spontaneously
born from the center of a lotus flower, was adorned by the thirty-two signs of
a great being, was a follower of the Dharma, a Dharma king, and possessed
the seven jewels of a cakravartin.
37. 42
“He had a full thousand sons who were courageous and heroic,
 who
had perfectly formed bodies, who crushed the armies of enemies
 and had
perfect bodies fully formed in all aspects.
1457
1458

37. 43
“In his harem there were a quintillion women, all of whom had originated
from roots of merit that corresponded to those of the cakravartin, who had
the same conduct as he had, were born adorned with jewels,
 had virtuous
minds, and had bodies that were no different from those of goddesses,
bodies that were the color of Jambu River gold, that emitted various divine
scents from the pores of their bodies, and that shone with a pure, aromatic,
divine light.
1459
“He had millions of ministers such as the precious prime minister.1460
37. 44
“The cakravartin king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa’s queen
named Saṃpūrṇa śrīvakrā was the precious woman. She was beautiful,
attractive, and lovely to look at. She possessed an excellent, magnificent,
perfect color. Her hair was deep black. She had deep black eyes.
 She had
golden skin. She had the voice of Brahmā. Light continually shone from her
body. She spread lights of various colors and divine aromas for a thousand
yojanas around her.
1461
37. 45
“Saṃpūrṇa śrīvakrā, the king’s queen, [F.120.a] had the cakravartin’s
daughter named Padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā.
 
She 
had 
a
completely perfect body. She was beautiful, attractive, and lovely to look at.
The whole world never had enough of looking at her. For example, noble
one, just as no one was ever satisfied that they had seen enough of the
cakravartin, in the same way no one was ever satisfied that they had seen
enough of the cakravartin’s daughter Padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī, except
for those who had gained the satisfaction of wisdom.
1462
37. 46
“At that time, in that time, beings had an immeasurable lifespan. There
was no definite lifespan, so death occurred during it.
 At that time, beings
had various shapes, various colors, various voices, various names, various
families, various lifespans, and different sizes; different aspirations,
strengths, diligences, and powers; different beautiful and ugly appearances;
and various higher and lower aspirations.
1463
37. 47
“Those beings who had good color, high aspirations, and perfect bodies
and were beautiful and lovely to look at said, ‘Oh! We have a much better
color than you!’
37. 48
“In the same way, those beings who had an excellent body shape were
dismissive and arrogant toward those beings who had ugly body shapes. In
that way, they did not care about each other, so that through the roots of
demerit, their lifespans diminished. Even their color, strength, and
happiness diminished.
37. 49
“To the north of the royal capital Ratna kusuma pradīpā there was the
bodhimaṇḍa tree called Samantāvabhāsana dharma megha nirghoṣa dhvaja
that manifested in each instant the display of the bodhimaṇḍas of all
tathāgatas. [F.120.b] Its roots were as hard and indestructible as diamond,


---

the king of jewels. Its bulk was made from all precious jewels and was vast
and huge. Its trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruit were made from all
jewels. It was perfectly symmetrical. It had branches that spread everywhere.
It was a spreading, unceasing display. It shone with the lights of various
jewels, its light rays shining everywhere. It resounded with descriptions of
the miraculous manifestations that were the scope of all the tathāgatas.
37. 50
“In front of that bodhimaṇḍa there was a lake of scented water called
Ratna kusuma vidyuddharma nigarjita megha ghoṣa. It was encircled by a
quintillion precious trees, and all those precious trees had the same form as
the Bodhi tree.
37. 51
“All the banks of that great lake of scented water called Ratna kusuma-
vidyuddharma nigarjita megha ghoṣa were covered with a splendid array of
all precious jewels, decorated by various strings of all jewels, adorned by an
array of mansions made of pure jewels, and beautified by an array of all pure
adornments.
“All around the bodhimaṇḍa were countless kūṭāgāras made of precious
jewels, with lotuses in their centers.
37. 52
“In the center of the great lake of scented water called Ratna kusuma-
vidyuddharma nigarjita megha ghoṣa there was a great king of lotuses
called Sarva tryadhva tathāgata viṣaya patra saṃdhi vidyotita megha vyūha. On
that great lotus appeared a tathāgata named Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa-
ketu rāja,
 who was the very first
 from among tathāgatas as numerous
as the atoms in Sumeru. He would be the first of all of them to attain the
highest, complete enlightenment in that kalpa. [F.121.a] Having ripened
beings by teaching the Dharma for many thousands of years, he was
ripening beings for ten thousand years through the miraculous
manifestation of the radiance of light rays, and then after ten thousand years
that tathāgata would appear there.
1464
1465
1466
37. 53
“At that time, the great king of lotuses, Sarva tryadhva tathāgata viṣaya-
patra saṃdhi vidyotita megha vyūha, radiated a ray of light called Sarva sattva-
virajaḥpradīpa. The beings who were touched by that ray of light knew that
in ten thousand years a tathāgata would come.
37. 54
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in nine thousand years, the
Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Virajovatī śrī garbhā. The beings who
were touched by that ray of light saw all subtle forms.
37. 55
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in eight thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva sattva karma vipāka-
nirghoṣa. The beings who were touched by that ray of light comprehended
the ocean of their own karma and attained the wisdom that remembers
karma.

37. 56
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in seven thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva kuśala mūla saṃbhava-
nirghoṣā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light gained
unimpaired complete faculties.
37. 57
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in six thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Acintya buddha viṣaya nidarśana-
nirghoṣā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light made
emanations with a vast motivation.
37. 58
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in five thousand years,
[F.121.b] the great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva buddha kṣetra-
pariśuddhi nigarjita pratibhāsa vijñāpanā. The beings who were touched by
that ray of light saw with complete purity all buddha realms.
37. 59
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in four thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva tathāgata viṣayāsaṃbheda-
pradīpā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light comprehended
the all-pervading miraculous manifestations of the tathāgatas.
37. 60
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in three thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva jagad abhimukha pradīpā.
The beings who were touched by that ray of light directly saw, through their
aspiration, the tathāgatas.
37. 61
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in two thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Tryadhva jñāna vidyut pradīpā.
The beings who were touched by that ray of light realized and
comprehended the ocean of the past ways of the tathāgatas.
37. 62
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in a thousand years, the
great Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Vitimira jñāna tathāgata pradīpā.
The beings who were touched by that ray of light attained the all-seeing
view of the vision that sees all the manifestations of the tathāgatas, all
realms, and all beings.
37. 63
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in a hundred years, the great
Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva jagad buddha darśana vipāka-
kuśala mūla saṃbhavā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light
attained the perception of the arising of the tathāgatas. [F.122.a]
37. 64
“At the time when the tathāgata would come in seven days, the great
Bodhi tree shined a ray of light called Sarva sattva praharṣa prīti prāmodya-
samudaya nirghoṣā. The beings who were touched by that ray of light
developed the great power of the joy of seeing the tathāgatas.
37. 65
“Noble one, he ripened beings through that kind of immeasurable method
of ripening through light rays for a thousand years. Then, on reaching the
seventh day, he blessed the entire world realm as completely pure by

shaking it through an immeasurable method for shaking it. In each instant of
mind, all the pure buddha realms of all the tathāgatas in the ten directions
with their various inconceivable displays appeared in that buddha realm.
37. 66
“On the last, seventh, day, the beings in that world realm had been
ripened by the sight of the buddhas, and they all came to face the
bodhimaṇḍa.
37. 67
“Then, from all that world realm’s Cakravāla mountains, from all the
Sumeru mountains, from all mountains, from all rivers, from all oceans, from
all trees, from all the surface of the ground, from all towns, from all walls,
from all dwellings, from all aerial palaces, from all clothes, jewelry, and
enjoyments, from all musical trees, from all sounds of musical instruments,
from all emanated displays, from each perceived thing, there came the
description of the range of activity and the power of all tathāgatas, and there
issued forth clouds of all incenses and perfumes; clouds of lights shining
from jewels; clouds of lights shining from all perfumes and incenses;
[F.122.b] clouds in the form of all perfume and jewels;
 clouds of all
clothing, jewels, and precious jewelry; clouds of Sumerus of various precious
flowers; many clouds of various powders; and clouds of the light rays of all
the tathāgatas. The Cakravāla mountains and so forth emitted clouds of the
halos of light of all the tathāgatas. They resounded with clouds of the music
of all instruments and drums. They emitted clouds of the sound of the
prayers of all the tathāgatas. They resounded with clouds of the aspects of
voice and the oceans of speech of all the tathāgatas. They manifested clouds
of various images of the signs and features of a great being possessed by all
the tathāgatas. They revealed countless omens of the coming of a tathāgata.
1467
37. 68
“The 
lotus 
Sarva tryadhva tathāgata viṣaya patra saṃdhi vidyotita megha-
vyūha had a retinue of great lotuses that were all made of the kings of
jewels. On the filaments and pericarps of the great lotuses that were the
retinue of the great lotus made of the kings of jewels, there were precious
lion thrones with great lotuses in their centers. They were as numerous as
the atoms in ten buddha realms. As many bodhisattvas as there are atoms in
ten buddha realms were seated cross-legged around those thrones with a
precious center.
37. 69
“The moment that tathāgata, the Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa-
ketu rāja, attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood,
many tathāgatas in world realms in the ten directions also attained the
highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood and, in accordance with
the dispositions of beings, turned the wheel of the Dharma. [F.123.a]
37. 70
“The countless beings in those world realms were turned away from all
lower realms and downfalls. Countless beings were brought to rebirth in the
higher realms. Countless beings were established on the level of the


---

śrāvakas. Countless beings were ripened for the enlightenment of the
pratyeka buddhas. Countless beings were ripened for the enlightenment that
arises in the light of power. Countless beings were ripened for
enlightenment in the banner of stainless diligence. Countless beings were
established in the enlightenment that arises in dwelling in meditation on the
Dharma. Countless beings were ripened for the enlightenment that arises in
meditation on the purification of the faculties. Countless beings were
ripened for the enlightenment that arises in comprehending the practice of
the equanimity of strength. Countless beings were established in the
enlightenment that arises in the emergence of the yāna with its field of
attention turned toward the city of the Dharma. Countless beings were
established in the enlightenment that arises in the yāna of the ways of
various miraculous manifestations that pervade everywhere. Countless
beings were established in the enlightenment that arises in the way of being
dedicated to practice. Countless beings were established in the
enlightenment that arises in the ways of entering samādhi. Countless beings
developed the aspiration for the enlightenment of the bodhisattvas.
Countless beings were established on the bodhisattva path. Countless
beings were established on the pure path of the perfections. [F.123.b]
Countless beings were established on the first bodhisattva bhūmi.
Countless beings were established on the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,
seventh, eighth, and ninth bodhisattva bhūmis. Countless beings were
established on the tenth bhūmi. Countless beings were brought into the
preeminent conduct and prayers of the bodhisattvas. Countless beings were
established in the completely good conduct and prayers of the bodhisattvas.
1468
37. 71
“In that way, the Tathāgata turned the wheel of the Dharma through the
inconceivable miraculous manifestations and the power of the preeminence
of a buddha, so that in each instant of mind he guided realms of beings
without end or center.
37. 72
“All the beings of that world realm understood the Dharma taught by that
tathāgata through various bodies and the accomplishment of various skillful
methods.
37. 73
“In order to guide those beings in the royal capital Ratna kusuma pradīpā,
who were proud and arrogant because of their form, color, scope, and
enjoyments and had no care for one another, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra
manifested a supreme color and form and went to the royal capital. His halo
was so vast that it illuminated the entire royal capital.1469
37. 74
“The light of the royal capital, the light from the body of the cakravartin
king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa, the light from the precious queen,
the light from the precious trees, the light from the precious jewels, the light


---

from the sun, moon, planets, and stars, and whatever lights there were in
Jambudvīpa all ceased to shine.
37. 75
“For example, [F.124.a] when the sun shines, darkness and the light of the
moon, planets, stars, and constellations vanish, and the light from fire and
jewels vanishes. In the same way, through being outshined by the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, all the lights in Jambudvīpa vanished.
37. 76
“It is just as if, for example, you were to place some lampblack
 in front
of a lump of Jambu River gold, it would not be beautiful, would not be bright,
would not glow, and would not shine. In the same way, when the physical
forms of those beings were in front of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, they
were not beautiful, were not bright, were not glowing, and were not shining.
1470
37. 77
“They thought, ‘In front of him our bodies, light, color, and brilliance are
not beautiful, not bright, not glowing, and they do not shine. Is this a deva or
Brahmā whose attributes we are unable to comprehend?’
37. 78
“Then the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra stood in the sky above the aerial
palace of the cakravartin king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa, which
was in the center of the royal capital Ratna kusuma pradīpā. He said to the
cakravartin king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa, ‘Great king, know
this! A tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha has appeared in this world. He is
dwelling in your land, at the bodhimaṇḍa called Samantāvabhāsana dharma-
megha nirghoṣa dhvaja.’1471
37. 79
“When the king’s daughter, Samanta jñānārci padma bhadrābhirāma netra-
śrī candrā, saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s body, light, miracles, and
adornments and heard his voice,
 she experienced a powerful happiness
and delight.
 [F.124.b]
1472
1473
37. 80
“At that time, she thought, ‘May I, through whatever roots of merit I
accumulate, attain a body like that! May I have that kind of jewelry, those
kinds of characteristics, that kind of conduct, and those kinds of miraculous
powers! Just as he has brought a great light for beings in the darkness of
night and told them of the birth of a buddha, so may I dispel the darkness of
ignorance in beings and bring them the light of great wisdom! Wherever I
am reborn, may I never in all those lives be separated from this
kalyāṇamitra!’
37. 81
“Then, noble one, the cakravartin king Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī-
cūḍa, with the four divisions of his army,
 with his seven jewels, with his
retinue of women, and with his ministers and the people of his land, through
the king’s miraculous powers, through the great might of the king, rose up
into the sky above the royal capital Ratna kusuma pradīpā to a height of one
yojana. He filled the whole of Jambudvīpa and the entire four-continent
world with a great light. In order to encourage all beings to come and see the
1474


---

Buddha, he manifested his image on all the precious mountains and became
present before all beings in the four-continent world realm and sang a song
of verses that praised seeing the Buddha:
37. 82
“ ‘Into the world has come a buddha
Who will be a savior for all who have bodies.
Everyone should rise and set forth
In order to see that lord of the world! {20}
37. 83
“ ‘The appearance of a tathāgata,
Someone who teaches the Dharma
In order to benefit all who have bodies,
May occur only once in a billion
 kalpas. {21}
1475
37. 84
“ ‘He developed compassion on seeing
The world having gone astray,
Obscured by the darkness of ignorance [F.125.a]
And experiencing the suffering of saṃsāra. {22}
37. 85
“ ‘In order to ripen beings
So as to extinguish all suffering,
He practiced enlightened conduct
For countless millions of kalpas. {23}
37. 86
“ ‘For limitless, endless kalpas,
For the sake of the supreme enlightenment of buddhahood,
He gave away his legs and his arms,
And he also gave away his eyes, ears, and head. {24}
37. 87
“ ‘To see him, honor him,
And hear him will be beneficial.
It is rare even in ten million kalpas
For a lord of the world to appear in the world. {25}
37. 88
“ ‘He is dwelling at the seat of enlightenment.
He is there like a supreme secret.
He has subjugated Māra and his armies
And attained the supreme enlightenment of buddhahood. {26}
37. 89
“ ‘There is an infinite aura of light
That radiates from the Buddha’s body.
Come see its various colors
That bring satisfaction to beings. {27}
37. 90
“ ‘There are countless clouds of light rays

That come from the Buddha’s body.
Those beings upon whom they shine
Attain an unparalleled happiness. {28}
37. 91
“ ‘Develop great diligence.
And each according to your wishes,
Make offerings to that protector.
Come! And go into his presence!’ {29}
37. 92
“After King Vairocana ratna padma garbha śrī cūḍa had thus encouraged all
the beings in his realm with those verses, the cakravartin’s roots of merit
created a rain of a million clouds of various offerings that descended onto
the 
bodhimaṇḍa 
Samantāvabhāsana dharma megha nirghoṣa dhvaja.
Clouds of precious parasols covered the entire sky. Clouds of canopies of all
flowers were spread above. Clouds of all kinds of food covered and adorned
the sky. Clouds of nets of bells of various jewels adorned the expanse of the
sky. [F.125.b] The adornment of clouds of light rays of perfume that had been
perfumed by an ocean of various perfumes was present
 throughout the
expanse of the sky. The adornment of clouds of thrones made of all jewels
with seats that were precious cushions was present throughout the expanse
of the sky. The adornment of clouds of upright banners, made of all jewels,
was present throughout the expanse of the sky. The all-covering adornment
of clouds of mansions and aerial palaces was present throughout the sky.
The all-covering adornment of clouds of various flowers was present
throughout the sky. The adornment of rain from clouds of every display of
offerings was present throughout the sky.

“The king approached the location of the Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci-
śrī guṇa ketu rāja. Having arrived, he bowed his head to the feet of the
Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja. Then with the Bhagavat to
his right, he circumambulated him many hundreds of thousands of times. He
then sat before the Bhagavat upon a seat that had as its center a great lotus
of precious jewels that shined light into the ten directions.
37. 94
“Then the cakravartin’s daughter, Padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā,
removed the jewelry from her body and scattered it over the Bhagavat
Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja.
37. 95
“She saw that the jewelry became a great parasol of jewelry made of
precious jewels that was situated in the air above the crown of the
Bhagavat’s head. Around its border hung a net of various jewels, it was held
by a lord of the nāgas, its round form was composed of all the jewelry, and it
was surrounded by a circle of ten parasols made of jewelry. [F.126.a] There
was also a beautiful display of a completely pure variety of kūṭāgāras. There
was a covering of clouds of every jewel adornment. There was a covering of

an array of trees made of all king jewels. There was the adornment of all the
king jewels of an ocean of perfume. In their center there was a great Bodhi
tree called Dharma dhātu prabhava sarva ratna maṇi śākhā pralamba. This was a
display with no end or center to its description, a variety of displays that
were revealed with each instant.
37. 96
“She saw at the foot of that tree the tathāgata named Vairocana.
“She saw bodhisattvas as numerous as the atoms in countless buddha
realms, who had all arisen through the completely good bodhisattva conduct
and prayer and practiced many countless various different bodhisattva
displays surrounding him and in front of him.
37. 97
“She also saw all the lords of the world present there.
“She saw the Bhagavat Vairocana’s buddha miracles that were without
end or center.
37. 98
“She comprehended his past bodhisattva conduct through a succession of
kalpas. She comprehended that world realm’s kalpas of formation and
destruction. She comprehended the succession of past buddhas in that world
realm.
“She saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra diligently making offerings at
the feet of all the tathāgatas. She saw his ripening and guiding of all beings.
37. 99
“She saw all bodhisattvas becoming images within the body of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, [F.126.b] and that she herself followed them
there.
“She saw the image of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra appearing
everywhere —at the feet of all the tathāgatas, in the dwelling places of all
beings, and in every one of the world realms.
37. 100
“She saw that in each of those world realms there were as many worlds as
there are atoms in a buddha realm, with the extent of their arrays and with
their foundations, their shapes, their forms, their various pure arrays, their
being covered by clouds of various displays, their various names and
numbers, the descriptions of their various buddha lineages and their various
appearances within the three times, their pervasion throughout the extent of
the directions, their various presences throughout the extent of the realm of
phenomena, their appearance within the various areas of the realm of
phenomena, their various locations within areas in space, their displays of
various bodhimaṇḍas,
 the arising of the various miracles of the
tathāgatas, the display of the various lion thrones of the buddhas, the
various oceans of the assemblies of followers of the tathāgatas, the various
activities of the followers of the tathāgatas, the revelation of the skillful
methods of the tathāgatas, the various ways of the turning of the Dharma

wheels of the tathāgatas, the arising of the various aspects of speech and the
sound of the voices of the tathāgatas, the teaching through an ocean of
various languages, and the roar of clouds of various sūtras.
37. 101
“When she saw that, she attained a powerful happiness and delight.
[F.127.a] After she had given rise to powerful happiness, that tathāgata, the
Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja, taught the sūtra called The
Resounding of the Dharma Wheels of All the Tathāgatas and as many
accompanying sūtras as there are atoms in ten buddha realms. When she
heard that sūtra, she attained the bliss of reaching ten thousand subtle
gateways to samādhi. This was like the day
 a consciousness enters the
mother’s womb, to give an analogy. This was like the completed karma of
beings. This was like a day
 in which a seed or seedling that is the cause
of an excellent sal
 tree
 is planted.
1479
1480
1481
1482
1483
1484
37. 102
“She attained these gentle and pleasant samādhis: the samādhi called
directly perceiving all tathāgatas, the samādhi called the radiance that goes through
the entire extent of all the realms, the samādhi called entry into comprehending all
the ways of the three times, the samādhi called the resounding of the Dharma wheels
of all the tathāgatas, the samādhi called perceiving the ocean of prayers by all the
buddhas, the samādhi called the perception of the resounding of the roaring that
saves beings afflicted by the suffering of saṃsāra, the samādhi called the array of
prayers to dispel the darkness of all beings, the samādhi called the perception of the
prayers for all beings to be free from suffering, the samādhi called the origin of the
attainment of happiness by all beings, the samādhi called the essence of never
wearying in ripening and guiding all beings, [F.127.b] the samādhi called the
banner of entering the path of all bodhisattvas, the samādhi of the display of reaching
all the bhūmis of the bodhisattvas, and the other ten thousand gateways to
samādhi.
37. 103
“She had a mind that rested in subtle equanimity, a mind that was
unwavering, a mind that was filled with joy, a mind that was relieved, a mind
that was immeasurable, a mind that followed the kalyāṇamitras, a mind that
was focused on profound omniscience, a mind that had entered an ocean of
the ways of kindness, a mind that had risen above all attachments, a mind
that did not dwell within the scope of the world, a mind that had entered the
scope of the tathāgatas, a mind that was illuminated by the forms and colors
of all the buddhas, a mind that was undisturbed, a mind that was
immovable,
 a mind that was without anger,
 a mind that was without
instability,
 a mind that was without weariness, a mind that was without
regression, a mind that was without dejection,
 a mind that understood
the nature of all phenomena, a mind that had the understanding of the
analysis of all phenomena, a mind that comprehended the ocean of all
beings, a mind that wished to save all beings, a mind that gave rise to the

illumination of the ocean of multitudes of buddhas, a mind that
comprehended the ocean of prayers of all the tathāgatas, a mind that
shattered the mountain of all obscurations, [F.128.a] a mind that
accomplished a vast accumulation of merit, a mind that was directed toward
attaining
 the ten strengths of the tathāgatas, a mind that had attained the
illumination of the range of all bodhisattvas, a mind that increased the
accumulations of all bodhisattvas, and a mind that pervaded throughout all
directions.
1489
37. 104
“With an ocean of prayers as numerous as the atoms in ten buddha
realms, she made the past prayers of all tathāgatas, so that she could
acquire
 completely good great prayers and purify her own buddha realm.
1490
37. 105
“They included prayers to ripen and guide all realms of beings, to know
the entire extent of the realm of phenomena, to comprehend the ocean of the
ways of the realm of phenomena, to practice bodhisattva conduct in all
buddha realms throughout future kalpas, to remain in the domain of
bodhisattva conduct throughout all future kalpas, to go into the presence of
all tathāgatas, to please all kalyāṇamitras, to perfectly make offerings to and
be an attendant for all tathāgatas, to attain omniscient wisdom in every
instant, and to have continuous bodhisattva conduct in order to attain
buddhahood.
37. 106
“Through accomplishing an ocean of gateways to prayers, as numerous as
the atoms in ten buddha realms, she was making the prayer for completely
good bodhisattva conduct.
37. 107
“In order for her to accomplish the completely good bodhisattva conduct
and prayer, the Bhagavat [F.128.b] Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja
encouraged her and inspired her with past roots of virtue that he taught,
revealed, explained, displayed, made stable so they would not be lost,
increased so that they would spread greatly, and caused to remain so that
there would be dedication to omniscience.
37. 108
“This concerned the first development of her aspiration to enlightenment
and her acquiring an ocean of the countless prayers of past tathāgatas.
37. 109
“Noble one, in a past time, ten kalpas before that, the daughter Samanta-
jñānārci padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā was following the teaching of
the Tathāgata Candra dhvaja śrī ketu in a world realm called Maṇi sūrya-
candra vidyotita prabhā. The bodhisattva Samanta bhadra instigated her to
repair a broken statue of the Tathāgata seated upon a lotus. When she had
repaired it, she painted it. When she had painted it, she adorned it with
jewels. Through following the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra she developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment.


---

37. 110
“As a result of that root of merit, she became a Dharma follower free of
downfalls. She was always born into a family of lords of devas or a family of
lords of humans. In all her lives she had a body that was attractive and lovely
to look at and had an excellent, beautiful color. She always saw tathāgatas
[F.129.a] and was never separated from the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. That
bodhisattva ripened her in every lifetime and made her remember. She
always honored the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra and was always devoted to
him.
37. 111
“Noble one, who do you think was the cakravartin king Vairocana ratna-
padma garbha śrī cūḍa at that time, in that time? Do not think that it was
anyone else. It was the bodhisattva Maitreya who was Vairocana ratna-
padma garbha śrī cūḍa at that time, in that time.
37. 112
“Noble one, who do you think was the king’s queen, Saṃpūrṇa śrīvakrā, at
that time, in that time? Do not think that it was anyone else. It was this night
goddess, Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī, who is before me.
37. 113
“Noble one, who do you think was the king’s daughter, Samanta jñānārci-
padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā, at that time, in that time? Do not think
that it was anyone else. I was at that time, in that time, the king’s daughter,
Samanta jñānārci padma bhadrābhirāma netra śrī candrā. When I was a young
girl in the time of the teaching of the Tathāgata Candra dhvaja śrī ketu and
repaired the statue of the Tathāgata seated upon a lotus, that was the cause
for my highest, complete enlightenment. At that time, the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra inspired me toward the highest, complete enlightenment,
and that was my first development of that aspiration. [F.129.b]
37. 114
“I went into the presence of the Bhagavat Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa-
ketu rāja and scattered my jewelry over him and then saw the Tathāgata’s
miraculous manifestations. Then when I heard the Dharma from that
bhagavat, I attained this bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that
guide beings that appear in all worlds.
37. 115
“I have honored tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru. I have
honored them by all the activities of offering them necessary articles and
attending upon them. I have heard all the Dharma that those tathāgatas have
taught, and I have followed the instructions and teachings of those
tathāgatas. I have greatly venerated those tathāgatas so that through that
veneration I have seen in an instant of mind all tathāgatas, their assemblies
of bodhisattvas, and all their buddha realms.
37. 116
“The world realm Vairocana tejaḥśrī
 passed away, and the kalpa called
Virajomaṇḍala came to an end. They were followed by the world realm called
Maṇi cakra vicitra pratimaṇḍita vyūhā and the kalpa called Mahāprabha, in
which appeared five hundred buddhas, and I honored all of them. The very
1491


---

first of them in the Mahāprabha kalpa was the tathāgata whose name was
Mahā karuṇa megha dhvaja. When he set forth into homelessness, I was a
night goddess who made offerings to him.
37. 117
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Vajra nārāyaṇa ketu. I
was a cakravartin who made offerings to him. [F.130.a] That tathāgata taught
me the sūtra called The Birth and Arising of All Buddhas, together with
accompanying sūtras as numerous as the atoms in ten buddha realms. I
heard it and retained it.
37. 118
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Jvalanārciḥ parvata-
śrī vyūha. I was a head merchant’s daughter and made offerings to him. That
tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The Essence of the Light of the Three Times,
together with accompanying sūtras as numerous as the atoms in
Jambudvīpa. I heard it and retained it.
37. 119
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Sarva dharma-
samudrābhyudgata vega rāja. I was a king of devas and made offerings to
him. That tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The Categories of the Knowledge of
All the Bases of the Realm of Phenomena, together with five hundred
accompanying sūtras. I heard it and retained it.
37. 120
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Gambhīra dharma śrī-
samudra prabha. I was the daughter of a lord of the nāgas and made an
offering to him of the rain from a cloud of kings of precious wish-fulfilling
jewels. That tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The Power of an Increasing
Ocean of Delight, together with a million accompanying sūtras. I heard it and
retained it.
37. 121
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Ratna śikharārciḥ-
parvata pradīpa. I was an ocean goddess who approached him and made an
offering of the rain from a cloud of precious lotuses. [F.130.b] That tathāgata
taught me the sūtra called Ways of the Ocean of Phenomena, together with
accompanying sūtras as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm. I heard it
and retained it, memorized it, and kept it.
37. 122
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Guṇa-
samudrāvabhāsa maṇḍala śrī. I was a ṛṣi with the five higher cognitions who
was encircled by sixty thousand ṛṣis and manifested great miracles. I
approached him and made an offering of the rain from a mountain-sized
cloud of perfumed lotuses. That tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The
Lamp of Phenomena Being without Location, together with ten thousand
accompanying sūtras. I heard it and retained it.
37. 123
“After that, there was the tathāgata whose name was Vairocana śrī garbha.
I was an earth goddess named Samatārtha saṃbhavā. Together with a
countless retinue of earth goddesses, I approached him to make an offering
of the rain falling from a cloud of precious flowers and a cloud of strings of


---

jewels that had arisen from the trunks of trees made of all jewels. That
tathāgata taught me the sūtra called The Essence of the Source of the Wisdom
That Is the Origin of All the Tathāgatas, together with countless accompanying
sūtras. I heard it, retained it, and did not lose it.
1492
37. 124
“Noble one, the last of all those five hundred tathāgatas was the tathāgata
Dharma dhātu gagana pūrṇa ratna śikhara śrī pradīpa who appeared in the
world. At that time, I was the daughter of a dancer [F.131.a] and had the
name Abhirāma śrīvakrā. The tathāgata came to the city, and when the
dancers were playing music, through the power of the Buddha I rose up into
the air and praised the tathāgata with a thousand verses. Then I went to him.
From the tathāgata’s ūrṇā hair shined a ray of light called the display of the
radiance of the realm of the Dharma, which illuminated my entire body. The
instant that light touched my body, I obtained the liberation called the
concentrated essence of the way of the realm of Dharma.
37. 125
“Noble one, in that way I pleased and made offerings to all those
tathāgatas, the five hundred buddhas that appeared in the world realm
called 
Maṇi cakra vicitra pratimaṇḍita vyūhā 
during 
the 
kalpa 
called
Mahāprabha. Those tathāgatas taught me the Dharma, and I remembered it
all. I did not forget a single letter or a single word of those ways of the
Dharma.
37. 126
“When I went before each of those tathāgatas, I recited the Buddha’s
Dharma, and in that way I benefited countless beings.
37. 127
“From each of those tathāgatas I obtained an ocean of the contents of the
realm of the Dharma, an illumination from the lightning of omniscience,
[F.131.b] which was called The Extensive Realm of the Dharma That Is the Essence
of the Knowledge of the Three Times, and I followed and continued all the
completely good conduct.
37. 128
“In that way, noble one, in each instant of mind there appear tathāgatas
without outer limit or center. When I see those tathāgatas, there is the
illumination of the lightning of omniscience, and that which I had not
previously attained, which I had not previously seen, becomes present
within the continuum of my mind, without ever deviating from the
completely good conduct of the bodhisattva.
37. 129
“Why is that? This attainment of the illumination from the lightning of
omniscience is a teaching that has no outer limit or center.”
37. 130
At that time, the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, in order to teach
further and classify the bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that
guide beings that appear in all worlds, through the blessing of the Buddha recited
these verses to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
37. 131
“The profound view is difficult; it is difficult to comprehend
The different ways of the extents of the three times


---

And the completely shining domain of Dharma light.
Listen to these words of mine, Sudhana. {30}
37. 132
“Listen to me as I reveal the way,
Wishing for the qualities of buddhahood,
I first developed the aspiration for enlightenment
And how it was I attained this liberation. {31}
37. 133
“In the past, beyond kalpa after kalpa,
As many as there are atoms in a buddha realm,
There was a vast, stainless, faultless world realm
Called Vairocana dhvaja pradīpa śrī. {32}
37. 134
“There had arisen the kalpa Virajomaṇḍala,
In which there was a succession of buddhas.
At that time those with the faultless ten strengths
Appeared as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru. {33}
37. 135
“The first of those sugatas was
Samanta jñāna ratnārci śrī guṇa ketu rāja,
Then there was the Jina Dharmadhvaja, then Śrīsumeru,
And the fourth jina was Guṇa keśarīśvara. {34}
37. 136
“Then there were the Jina Śānti rāja, Samitāyus,
Yaśaḥparvata, Guṇa sumeru śrī,
The Jina Abhāskara, and the Bhagavat Śaśimukha,

The tenth buddha was Dharma dhātu kusuma.
In that way, these were the second ten
From the description of the ocean of buddhas. {37}

In that way, those were the third ten
Within the way of this vast teaching. {39}

“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations
that guide beings that appear in all worlds. How could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who remain in the aspiration to an
ocean of bodhisattva conduct that has no outer limit or center, who have
bodies in accordance with the various dispositions of beings, who
accomplish an ocean of various faculties, and who have the realization of the
various kinds of bodhisattva conduct and prayers?

“Depart, noble one. Here in the bodhimaṇḍa, there is the goddess of the
night named Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī.

night goddesses. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
37. 162
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī, circumambulated the night
goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī many hundreds of thousands of times,
keeping her to his right, [F.133.b] and, looking back again and again,
departed from the night goddess Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī. [B8]

Chapter 38
PRAŚANTA RUTA SĀGARA VATĪ
38. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, meditating on the night goddess
Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī’s bodhisattva liberation called the manifestations that
guide beings that appear in all worlds, and contemplating it, having faith in it,
engaging in it, increasing it, expanding it, augmenting it,
 gaining power
over it, illuminating it, and being absorbed in it, approached the night
goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī.
1497
38. 2
He bowed his head to the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī’s feet,
circumambulated the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī many hundreds
of thousands of times, and then stood before the night goddess Praśanta-
ruta sāgara vatī.
38. 3
With his hands placed together in homage, he said, “Āryā, I have entered
upon the highest, complete enlightenment, and through relying on

vyūha, during the kalpa called Samantāvabhāsa dhvaja, I venerated as many
tathāgatas as there are atoms in ten buddha realms. Sometimes I venerated

them when I was a lord of devas; sometimes, when I was a lord of nāgas;
sometimes, when I was a lord of yakṣas; sometimes, when I was a lord of
gandharvas; sometimes, when I was a lord of asuras; sometimes, when I was
a lord of kinnaras; sometimes, when I was a lord of mahoragas; sometimes,
when I was a lord of humans; sometimes, when I was a lord of Brahmās;
sometimes, when I was a deva; sometimes, when I was a human; sometimes,
when I was a woman; sometimes, when I was a man; sometimes, when I was
a boy; and sometimes, when I was a girl. To all those tathāgatas I made
offerings and offered whatever I possessed. I attended to all those
tathāgatas. I heard the Dharma that all those tathāgatas taught.
38. 66
“After I passed away, I practiced bodhisattva conduct in that world realm
for as many kalpas as there are atoms in a buddha realm.
38. 67
“Then, when I passed away, I was reborn in this Sahā world realm in the
ocean of world realms called Kusuma tala garbha vyūhālaṃkāra.
38. 68
“I venerated the Tathāgata Krakucchanda. As soon as I saw that
tathāgata, I attained a samādhi called the radiance that is free of all darkening dust.
38. 69
“Subsequently, I venerated the Tathāgata Kanaka muni. [F.143.b] As soon
as I saw that tathāgata, I attained a samādhi called the radiance that spreads
throughout all the ocean of realms.
38. 70
“Subsequently, I venerated the Tathāgata Kāśyapa. As soon as I saw that
tathāgata, I attained a samādhi called the thunder of the sounds of the ocean of the
languages of all beings.
38. 71
“Subsequently, I venerated the Tathāgata Vairocana. At the bodhimaṇḍa,
he manifested in each instant of mind an ocean of the gateways to the
miraculous manifestations of a tathāgata’s buddhahood. As soon as I saw
that, I attained this bodhisattva liberation called the display in each instant of
mind of the arising of the power of vast delight. As soon as I had attained it, I
entered an ocean of the ways of the realm of phenomena that were as
numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms. I saw
that in each of the atoms that were all the atoms within all buddha realms in
that ocean of all the ways of the realm of phenomena, there were buddha
realms as numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha
realms.
38. 72
“I saw that among all those buddha realms, in each buddha realm there
was the Bhagavat Vairocana going to the bodhimaṇḍa and in each instant of
mind manifesting the miraculous manifestation of the attainment of
buddhahood. Each miraculous manifestation of the attainment of
buddhahood completely pervaded the ocean of ways of the realm of
phenomena.

38. 73
“I perceived that among all those tathāgatas, I was seated at the feet of
every one of those tathāgatas. [F.144.a] I heard all the Dharma that was
taught by all those tathāgatas seated at the bodhimaṇḍa in those world
realms.

“An ocean of emanations came from each pore of all those tathāgatas,
roaring out an ocean of clouds of Dharma, manifesting various miraculous
manifestations, and turning the wheel of the Dharma according to the
various dispositions of beings born into various kinds of existences, the
entire extent of all beings in all the ocean of realms, in all successions of
world realms, in the entire extent of world realms within the ocean of every
direction in the realm of phenomena.
38. 75
“I possess all those turnings of the Dharma wheel, comprehend them,
understand them, and keep them through the power of mental retention that
has the prowess of maintaining all their meaning, words, and letters. I purify
them with wisdom that understands the essence of the pure domain of all
the Dharmas. I understand their categories through skill in the analysis of
the ocean of all Dharmas. I permeate them with an understanding that is as
vast as the three times. I perceive them as equal through the wisdom that
comprehends the equality of the tathāgatas. I accomplish all the ways of the
Dharma. I attain clouds of sūtras within all the Dharmas.
 I am established
in an ocean of Dharma within the clouds of all sūtras. I am established in the
categories of Dharma in the ocean of all Dharmas. I know clouds of Dharma
within the categories of all Dharmas. [F.144.b] I give rise to waves of Dharma
within the clouds of all Dharmas. I attain an ocean of the power of delight in
the Dharma within the waves of all Dharmas. I accomplish the power of
attaining the bhūmis
 within the power of delight in all Dharmas. I
accomplish the power of an ocean of samādhis within the power of all the
bhūmis. I attain an ocean of visions of the buddhas within the clouds of

“You ask me how long it has been since I attained this bodhisattva
liberation called the display in each instant of mind of the arising of the power of vast
delight? [F.146.a] It was like this: As many kalpas ago as there are atoms in
two buddha realms, in the world realm called Kanaka vimala prabhā, I was a
Bodhi-tree goddess by the name of Puṇya pradīpa saṃpatsamanta ketu-
prabhā. When I heard the Dharma taught by the Tathāgata Avivartya-
dharma dhātu nirghoṣa, I developed that aspiration to attain the highest,
complete enlightenment. I practiced bodhisattva conduct for as many kalpas
as there are atoms in two buddha realms and was then reborn in this world
realm called Sahā. I venerated the tathāgatas of the Bhadra kalpa, from
Krakucchanda to Śākyamuni, and I will also venerate its future buddhas.
And just as in this world realm, I will venerate and make offerings to the
future succession of buddhas in all world realms.
38. 78
“Noble one, there continues even now to be a succession of buddhas in
the world realm Kanaka vimala prabhā.
“Therefore, noble one, you should dedicate yourself to this way with the
fortitude of the bodhisattva.”
38. 79
At that time, the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī, in order to teach
further the bodhisattva liberation called the display in each instant of mind of the
arising of the power of vast delight, recited these verses to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son:
38. 80
“Listen, Sudhana, to these words of mine
About how I obtained this good liberation.
Hearing them will give rise to great delight,
And you must comprehend this liberation. {1}
38. 81
“I purified my mind and my thoughts,
And I developed a vast, powerful aspiration. [F.146.b]
Intent on the city of omniscient wisdom,
I practiced for many oceans of past kalpas. {2}
38. 82
“I listened to the sugatas in the three times
And developed an aspiration toward them all.
Through the passage of many hundreds of kalpas,
I attended on them and their assemblies. {3}
38. 83
“I saw the sugatas of the past and made offerings to them


---

Over a long time, so as to bring benefit to beings.
Having developed a powerful enthusiasm,
I listened to their Dharma without weariness.
 {4}
1526
38. 84
“On following the way of this liberation,
I continually and respectfully attended
Those who were my father, mother, and guru,
Venerating them and bringing them happiness and benefit. {5}
38. 85
“Through hundreds of lifetimes and with a loving mind,
I was a wealthy protector who brought happiness
To many people who were old, who were sick, and who were poor,
Who had impaired faculties, were in suffering, and had no protector. {6}
38. 86
“During my bodhisattva conduct in past lives,
I saved beings from an ocean of various dangers
Caused by kings, fire, and bandits1527
And by lions, elephants, and enemies. {7}
38. 87
“During my bodhisattva conduct in past lives,
I saved beings afflicted by kleśas in the three realms
From the various terrors of the ocean of existence
That arise through their bad actions. {8}
38. 88
“I protected those classes of beings
Who have fallen into the abyss of saṃsāra,
Terrified by the sufferings of the lower realms,
Which are always overwhelmingly dreadful.
As I practiced bodhisattva conduct in the world,
I ended the terrors of birth, old age, sickness, and death.
 {9}
1528
38. 89
“My prayer is that until the last kalpa
I will bring an end to the suffering of saṃsāra;
I will bring happiness to all beings
And give rise to the ultimate happiness of buddhahood. {10}
38. 90
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the display in each
instant of mind of the arising of the power of vast delight. [F.147.a] How could I
know the conduct or describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who have
comprehend the entire realm of phenomena, who are liberated from every
outer and inner suffering, who know the names of all kalpas, who are wise
in the creation of the ocean of all worlds and their destruction?

38. 91
“Depart, noble one. Here in this very bodhimaṇḍa, within the assembly of
the Bhagavat Vairocana, there is the goddess of the night who has the name
Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a
bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva
practice it?’ ”
38. 92
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, recited these appropriate verses
to the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī:
38. 93
“The kalyāṇamitra instructed me correctly,
And therefore I came into your presence, goddess.
I saw you seated upon your throne
With a body that knows no limit or center. {11}
38. 94
“Those who rely on existence and believe things to be real,
Whose fields of perception are colors, shapes, and characteristics,
Inferior beings who hold wrong views,
Cannot know this field of activity of yours. {12}
38. 95
“The vision of your body is infinite.
The world and its devas could not know
The characteristics of your form and color
Even by examining them for endless kalpas. {13}
38. 96
“Goddess, you are above the basis of the skandhas.
You are not located within the āyatanas.
There is no doubt that you have transcended the world
And manifest miracles within the world. {14}
38. 97
“You are unshakable, without fault, without impediment.
You have purified your eyes of wisdom.
You see in an atom as many buddhas
As there are atoms, performing miracles. {15}
38. 98
“Your body has the essence of the Dharma body. [F.147.b]
Your mind consists of unobstructed wisdom.
You shine with the radiance of all-pervading light,
Illuminating the endless beings in the world. {16}
38. 99
“Endless karma arises from the mind.
All the worlds are paintings by karma.
You know directly the minds of beings,
And the manifestations of your body are as numerous as beings. {17}
38. 100
“You know this world to be like a dream


---

And that all the buddhas are like reflections,
That every single Dharma is like an echo,
And without impediment you act within all worlds. {18}
38. 101
“You manifest your body in each instant
To all the beings dwelling in the three times.
With no duality in your mind,
You teach the Dharma throughout all directions. {19}
38. 102
“The ocean of atoms is without end,
And the ocean of beings is also measureless.
The ocean of the buddhas has no edge or center,
And they are all within the scope of your liberation.” {20}
38. 103
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having praised the night goddess
Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī with these appropriate verses, circumambulated the
night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī many hundreds of thousands of
times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed
from the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī. [B9]

SARVA NAGARA RAKṢĀ SAṂBHAVA TEJAḤ ŚRĪ
39. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was meditating on, familiarizing himself
with,
 and cultivating the bodhisattva liberation called the display in each
instant of mind of the arising of the power of vast delight. He was following,
remembering, [F.148.a] and comprehending the instruction and teachings of
the night goddess Praśanta ruta sāgara vatī, remembering each word and
letter, the numerous countless aspects, the knowledge of the aspects of the
nature of phenomena, and he was relying on it through his memory,
analyzing 
it 
with 
his 
intelligence, 
comprehending 
it 
with 
his
understanding,
 increasing it with his intellect, feeling it with his body,
practicing it, and engaging in it, and eventually he arrived where the night
goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī was.
1529
1530
39. 2
He saw the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī seated
upon a great lotus throne containing the kings of precious jewels that
illuminate towns and dwellings, with an entourage of countless night
goddesses, with a body that appeared in all directions to all beings, with a
body that had the forms of those of all beings, with a body that appeared
before all beings, with a body that was unstained by all beings, with a body
that had the same nature as that of all beings, with a body that was superior
to those of all beings, with a body of the kind that could ripen and guide all
beings, with a body through which she spoke to all beings, with a body that
did not pass away among all beings, with a body that had vanquished all
obscurations, with a body that had the nature of the ultimate nature of
things,
 with a body that had reached the conclusion of guiding all beings.
1531
39. 3
When Sudhana saw her, he was filled with joy, delighted, elated, pleased,
and happy. He bowed his head to the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā-
saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī’s feet, circumambulated the night goddess Sarva nagara-
rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī many hundreds of thousands of times, and then
stood before the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī.

39. 4
With his hands placed together in homage, [F.148.b] he said, “Goddess! I
have entered upon the highest, complete enlightenment. Goddess, I pray
that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct
so that they will be a medicine
 for beings. How do bodhisattvas gather
beings into the highest gathering? How do bodhisattvas, authorized by the
tathāgatas, dedicate themselves to bodhisattva conduct so that, having
become dedicated, they become kings of the Dharma.
1532
39. 5
The night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī said to Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you ask
about conduct that is a rain from clouds of Dharma that accords with the
aspiration of the entire ocean of beings, so as to reach the conclusion of
ripening and guiding all beings; so as to reach the conclusion of joining and
maintaining the family of the tathāgatas; so as to conjoin with the wisdom
that pervades throughout the extent of the directions; so as to focus on
comprehending the entire ocean of the ways of the realm of the Dharma; so
as to pervade the infinity of all that can be known, which is as vast as the
extent of space; and so as to obtain and possess the wheels of Dharma of all
the tathāgatas.
39. 6
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the entry into
beautiful sounds and profound manifestations.
39. 7
“Noble one, through this liberation I undertake being on the unimpeded
level of a dharmabhāṇaka. I have the aspiration to make a gift of the Dharma
treasure of all the tathāgatas. I have attained the power of great love and
compassion. [F.149.a] I am dedicated to activities that benefit all beings in
order to bring all beings to the aspiration for enlightenment. I remain on the
level of a guide for beings so that they will continuously gather the
accumulation of the roots of merit of the aspiration for enlightenment. In
order to bring all beings onto the path to omniscience, I engage in causing
the sun of the Dharma to appear out of the clouds of the Dharma in the
world. I continuously engage in a motivation that regards all beings as equal
in order to illuminate all worlds with countless roots of merit. I am conjoined
with a pure motivation so that all beings will know the accomplishment of
accumulating roots of merit. I engage in being a leader of the caravan of all
beings so that they will appropriately accomplish all the paths of good
actions; I am engaged in the activity of causing all beings to reject all paths
of bad actions and be established in the Dharma of good actions. I am
engaged in teaching the path to happiness to all beings. I bring all beings to
the beginning of the array of the yānas. I am engaged in establishing all
beings in all virtuous Dharma practices. I am engaged in providing
unceasing service and veneration to all kalyāṇamitras. I am engaged in
establishing all beings in the teaching of the tathāgatas. I am engaged in


---

causing all beings to commence upon good qualities through receiving the
very first gift of the Dharma. I cause the arising of an aspiration for
omniscience that is enduring and indestructible. I have the vast domain of
the aspiration focused on the strengths of the Buddha, which is as enduring
and solid as the most powerful vajra, [F.149.b] and I practice by relying on a
kalyāṇamitra.
39. 8
“I have a mind that shatters the mountain of all the obscurations from
karma and kleśas. I am dedicated to the accumulation of omniscience. I am
engaged in accomplishing all good qualities. I am dedicated to being
engaged in a mind that is focused on and aspires for omniscience that has no
end or center.
39. 9
“Noble one, in that way, I am purifying the revelation to all beings of the
gateway to the light of the Dharma, and I am establishing them in gathering
the accumulation of roots of merit.
39. 10
“I look upon, comprehend, and fathom the realm of phenomena in ten
ways. What are those ten? (1) I comprehend the realm of phenomena
because I have attained the vast light of wisdom. (2) I comprehend the realm
of phenomena as having no end and no center in order to perceive the
miraculous manifestations of all the tathāgatas. (3) I comprehend the realm
of phenomena as limitless in order to reach all buddha realms and to make
offerings and show veneration to the tathāgatas. (4) I comprehend the realm
of phenomena as having no boundary in order to have the vision of
bodhisattva activities within the ocean of all worlds. (5) I comprehend the
realm of phenomena as being without division in order to enter the
undivided domain of wisdom of the tathāgatas. (6) I comprehend the realm
of phenomena as singleness [F.150.a] in order to enter the domain of speech
of the tathāgatas, which is perceived by all beings in accordance with their
aspirations. (7) I comprehend the realm of phenomena as having a nature of
vastness
 in order to realize the ultimate conclusion of the past prayers of
the tathāgatas to reach the conclusion of guiding all beings. (8) I
comprehend the realm of phenomena as having the equality of all beings in
order to realize the vast extent of completely good bodhisattva conduct. (9) I
comprehend the realm of phenomena as a single adornment in order to
comprehend the adornment of the miraculous manifestations of completely
good conduct. (10) I comprehend the realm of phenomena as being
indestructible
 in order for the pure pervasion of the realm of phenomena
by all good actions to have the nature of indestructibility.
1533
1534
39. 11
“Noble one, I look upon, comprehend, and fathom the entire realm of
phenomena in those ten ways in order to gather all the accumulations of
good karma, in order to comprehend the greatness of the buddhas, and in
order to realize the inconceivable scope of the buddhas.

39. 12
“Moreover, noble one, I teach the Dharma to beings with my mind fixed
upon the greatness of the tathāgatas and through ten-thousandfold domains
of the activity of mental retention. What are those ten? They are (1) the
domain of mental retention called the gathering of the entire ocean of the Dharma,
(2) the domain of mental retention called the blessing of all dharmas, (3) the
domain of mental retention called the holding of all dharmas, (4) the domain of
mental retention called the lamp of the intention of all the tathāgatas, (5) the
domain of mental retention called the essence that illuminates the ocean of the
karma of all beings, [F.150.b] (6) the domain of mental retention called the
fathoming of the entire stainless ocean of the ways of the yānas,
 (7) the domain of
mental retention called the proclamation of the turning
 of the wheel of the names
of all the buddhas, (8) the domain of mental retention called the fathoming of the
teaching of the ocean of the past prayers of the buddhas in the three times, (9) the
domain of mental retention called the intense power of the gathering of all dharmas,

mental retention and the rest of the ten thousand domains of mental
retention.

comprehending that in the way of the realm of the Dharma there is no
differentiation in the ocean of the tathāgatas. Thereby I create an
unsurpassable accumulation of the Dharma, continue with the bodhisattva’s
completely good conduct throughout all future kalpas, and meditate on this
bodhisattva liberation called the entry into beautiful sounds and profound
manifestations, expanding with each instant of mind the way of meditation on
the vista of this liberation, with each instant of mind expanding throughout
the entire realm of phenomena the way of meditation on the vista of this
liberation.” [F.151.b]
39. 26
Sudhana said, “Goddess, it is wonderful that this bodhisattva liberation is
so profound. Āryā, how long has it been since you attained this bodhisattva
liberation?”
She replied, “Noble one, in the past, in time gone by, beyond as many
kalpas as there are atoms in a world realm, there was a world realm called
Dharmārci nagara meghā, which had as many clouds of perfumed jewels as
there are atoms in a four-continent world realm. It was bordered with lotuses
that had been proclaimed in the past prayers of all the tathāgatas. Its body
was formed from the ocean as the king of precious jewels, having arisen
from the ocean of the karma of all beings. It had the shape of a great lotus. It
was both pure and defiled.
 It had as many encircling Cakravāla mountain
ranges of lotuses as there are atoms in Sumeru. It was adorned by as many
risen Sumerus of perfumed jewels as there are atoms in Sumeru. It was
adorned by as many great four-continent worlds as there are atoms in
Sumeru. In each four-continent world there was an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of
quintillions of cities.
1537
39. 27
“Noble one, there was in that world realm a kalpa called Vimalābha.
During that kalpa there appeared as many tathāgatas as there are atoms in
Sumeru. In the center of that world realm called Dharmārci nagara meghā
1538


---

there was a four-continent world called Vicitra dhvaja, in the center of which
was the royal capital called Samanta ratna kusuma prabhā.
39. 28
“Not far from that royal capital was a bodhimaṇḍa called Dharma rāja-
bhavana pratibhāsa. [F.152.a] At that bodhimaṇḍa there appeared the
Tathāgata Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa prabha rāja, the first of the tathāgatas
of that kalpa, who were as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru.
39. 29
“At that time there was a cakravartin king by the name of Vimala-
vakrabhānu prabha, who received from the Tathāgata Sarva dharma sāgara-
nirghoṣa prabha rāja the sūtra called The Ocean of All Dharmas. After he had
received it, after the Dharma wheel was turned, and after the passing into
nirvāṇa, the king entered homelessness and possessed all the teaching.
39. 30
“At the time when the teaching was reaching its end, it divided into a
thousand teachings, and in each teaching there was a division into a
thousand ways of teaching. During the intermediate kalpa of deterioration,
beings were obscured by the obscurations of karma and kleśas, and they
were engaged in fighting, quarreling, and disruption. Bhikṣus were not
concerned with the good qualities of the Buddha’s teachings but were
dedicated to delighting in the objects of the senses, engaged in
conversations about kings and thieves, were interested in stories about
women and countries and oceans, and used the words of the Lokāyatas.
39. 31
“The follower of the Dharma cried out, ‘Oh! The great lamp of the Dharma,
which has been established for many kalpas, is close to being extinguished!’
Having said these sad words, he rose into the air to the height of seven palm
trees and emanated clouds of light of infinite colors. When he had emanated
that great display of a net of light rays of various colors, [F.152.b] those
multicolored lights pacified the torment of the kleśas in the world and
established beings without end or center in enlightenment, which revived
the teachings of the tathāgata so that it remained for a further sixty thousand
years.
39. 32
“At that time, the cakravartin king Vimala vakrabhānu prabha’s daughter, a
bhikṣuṇī by the name of Dharma cakra nirmāṇa prabhā, had an entourage of a
hundred thousand bhikṣuṇīs. When she heard those sad words and saw
that miraculous manifestation, she and her entourage developed the
aspiration for enlightenment, and the hundred thousand bhikṣuṇīs became
irreversible on the path to the highest, complete enlightenment and attained
the samādhi called the manifest presence of the tathāgatas. They also obtained the
power of mental retention called the light emanated from the Dharma wheel of all
the tathāgatas. They also attained the perfection of wisdom called the entry into
all the ways of the ocean of the Dharma. The bhikṣuṇī Dharma cakra nirmāṇa-
prabhā attained the samādhi called the lamp of the light that arises from the
teachings of all the tathāgatas, and she attained in a subtle and gentle way this


---

bodhisattva liberation called the entry into beautiful sounds and profound
manifestations. When she had attained that, she directly perceived all the
miraculous manifestations of the Tathāgata Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa-
prabha rāja.
39. 33
“Noble one, what do you think? At that time, in that time, who do you
think was the cakravartin king Vimala vakrabhānu prabha, who entered
homelessness in the teaching of the Tathāgata Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa-
prabha rāja [F.153.a] and, after the turning of the wheel of the Dharma and the
passing into nirvāṇa, when the teachings were coming to an end, lit the
Dharma lamp of holding the teaching? Noble one, do not think that he was
anyone else; at that time, in that time, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra was
the cakravartin king Vimala vakrabhānu prabha.
39. 34
“Noble one, what do you think? At that time, in that time, who do you
think was the bhikṣuṇī Dharma cakra nirmāṇa prabhā, the daughter of the
cakravartin king Vimala vakrabhānu prabha, who had an entourage of a
hundred thousand bhikṣuṇīs? Noble one, do not think that she was anyone
else; at that time, in that time, I was the bhikṣuṇī Dharma cakra nirmāṇa-
prabhā. In that way, I held the teaching of the Tathāgata Sarva dharma-
sāgara nirghoṣa prabha rāja. I caused those hundred thousand bhikṣuṇīs to
progress irreversibly toward the highest, complete enlightenment. I
established them in the samādhi called the manifest presence of the tathāgatas. I
also established them in the power of mental retention called the light
emanated from the Dharma wheel of all tathāgatas and the perfection of wisdom
called the entry into all the ways of the ocean of the Dharma.
39. 35
“After that tathāgata, I venerated the Tathāgata Vimala dharma parvata-

39. 36
“In that way, noble one, there were these hundred buddhas and the other
tathāgatas, as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru, who appeared in the kalpa
called Vimalābha.


---

39. 37
“Noble one, the last of those tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in
Sumeru was a tathāgata by the name of Dharma dhātu nagarābha jñāna-
pradīpa rāja. [F.156.b]
39. 38
“In that way, noble one, I made offerings to those tathāgatas as numerous
as the atoms in Sumeru, beginning with Sarva dharma sāgara nirghoṣa prabha-
rāja and ending with Dharma dhātu nagarābha jñāna pradīpa rāja. I attended to
all those tathāgatas. I heard the Dharma taught by them all. I entered
homelessness in the teachings of all those tathāgatas. I possessed the
teachings of all those tathāgatas. I obtained the bodhisattva liberation called
the entry into beautiful sounds and profound manifestations from all those
tathāgatas, obtaining it in various ways. At the feet of all those tathāgatas I
ripened an ocean of beings without edge or center.
39. 39
“Since then, in practicing the Dharma I have made offerings to as many
buddhas as have appeared throughout as many kalpas as there are atoms in
a buddha realm.
39. 40
“Noble one, during that time, I have watched over beings as they slept in
ignorance in the darkness of saṃsāra. I have guarded the cities of their
minds. I have brought them up out of the city of the three realms and
brought them into the city of omniscience.
39. 41
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the entry into
beautiful sounds and profound manifestations, which prevents meaningless
worldly talk, establishes speech that is not dishonest, and concludes with it
being firmly established in truth. [F.157.a] How could I know the conduct or
describe the qualities of bodhisattvas who know without impediment all
languages,
 who understand all Dharma in each instant of mind, who
comprehend all the words and languages of all beings, who are skilled in
accumulating the entire ocean of languages, who are skilled in the ways and
practices of an ocean of numbers and terms in all Dharmas, who have the
power of an ocean of mental retention that engages with all the Dharma,
who are skilled in creating clouds of Dharma that accord with the
dispositions of all beings, and who have fully attained ripening and guiding
all beings? How could I know their practice of gathering all beings, their
application 
to 
undertaking 
supreme 
bodhisattva 
activity,
 
their
comprehension of very subtle bodhisattva knowledge, their power of
supremacy in opening the treasures and treasuries of bodhisattva Dharma,
or their ascending the lion throne for teaching the bodhisattva Dharma?
1541
1542
39. 42
“Why is that? It is because those excellent beings have all attained the
retention of the domain of the level of the entire Dharma.
39. 43
“Depart, noble one. Here at the feet of the Bhagavat Vairocana, there is the
goddess of the night who has the name Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha-
saṃvāsā. She is not far from me, so go to her and ask her, ‘How should


---

bodhisattvas
 train in omniscience? How should they practice it so as to
bring all beings to omniscience?’ ” [F.157.b]
1543
39. 44
Then at that time, the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī,
in order to teach further the bodhisattva liberation called the entry into
beautiful sounds and profound manifestations, recited these verses to Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son:
39. 45
“Profound and difficult to see is the bodhisattvas’ liberation
By which they know every jina in the three times,
The entire realm of phenomena without edge or center,
And the complete extent of the characteristics of all cognition.
 {1}
1544
39. 46
“The ways of the liberation that arise from the accumulations are infinite.
They are inconceivable and immeasurable, for they attain
 the true nature.
1545
You should enter into the paths of the ways of love in the three times
That completely increase power that is unimpeded. {2}
39. 47
“There was a realm in the past, beyond as many kalpas
As there are atoms that exist in a buddha realm;
That glorious
 world realm was Dharmārci megha nagara,
1546
And there was a very bright kalpa called Vimalābha. {3}
39. 48
“In that one kalpa there appeared an unbroken succession of jinas,
As many buddhas as there are atoms in Sumeru.
First to appear, the first in that kalpa,
Was the Sugata Dharma samudra prabha garjita rāja. {4}
39. 49
“The last of those tathāgatas to appear in the world
Was the Jina Dharma megha nagarābha pradīpa rāja.
I came before them all and made offerings to them.
From them all I heard the Dharma with great joy. {5}
39. 50
“First I saw, having a golden light,
Dharma samudra prabha garjita rāja,
Adorned with the thirty-two signs and resembling Meru,
And seeing him I thought, ‘I shall become a sugata!’ {6}
39. 51
“The very moment I saw that tathāgata,
There arose the powerful first aspiration to become a jina
Who had the character of the true nature, as vast
 as space, [F.158.a]
1547
Because of the all-pervading arising of omniscience. {7}
39. 52
“All of the sugatas within the three times,
Encircled by oceans of all the bodhisattvas,


---

The extensive ocean of realms with their oceans of beings,
Have arisen from the great ocean of the amrita of compassion. {8}
39. 53
“I also aspired that in order to ripen beings
I would pervade every single realm with my body,
Manifest a body to beings in accordance with their aspirations,
And illuminate and shake every single realm. {9}
39. 54
“I also came before the second buddha
And saw jina lords in ten oceans of realms.
I saw the last jina within an ocean of realms
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms. {10}
39. 55
“Since then, during kalpas as numerous as a realm’s atoms,
I have gone before and made offerings to
All of the jinas, the lamps of the world, who appeared
And purified an ocean of ways of liberation.” {11}
39. 56
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, attained this bodhisattva liberation
called the entry into beautiful sounds and profound manifestations, attained an
endless, centerless ocean of samādhis, gained an understanding that arose
from a vast ocean of gateways to retention, attained the great illumination of
a bodhisattva’s higher cognitions, and entered an ocean of great
discernment,
 and in his mind spread a vast ocean of powerful delight.
1548
39. 57
He then praised the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī by
reciting these appropriate verses:
39. 58
“Your wisdom is active in a vast ocean of the Dharma.
You practice in the centerless, endless ocean of existences.
The essence of your perfect wisdom body lives long without illness. [F.158.b]
Goddess, you have come and beautified this assembly. {12}
39. 59
“You have realized the nature of phenomena to be like space.
You realize without impediment the ways of all three times.
In each instant of mind there are inconceivable, countless
Perceptions, all of which are without conceptualization. {13}
39. 60
“With your wisdom eyes you see the true nature in which there are no
beings,
Yet you perceive with compassion the infinite ocean of beings.
You enter the very vast
 liberation of your mind,
1549
And you guide and ripen countless beings. {14}
39. 61
“You know through analyzing the field of phenomena.


---

You have realized the way of knowing the nature of phenomena.
You meditate on all the stainless paths of the āryas.
You purify all beings without exception and liberate them. {15}
39. 62
“You have realized the stainless wisdom of omniscience.
Goddess, you have become the supreme guide
 of beings.
1550
You pervade all beings within the realm of phenomena
And teach them the Dharma and end all fear in the world. {16}
39. 63
“Goddess, through the way of the prayers of Vairocana,
You have a vast,
 stainless, unimpeded, exact understanding.
1551
You have understood the power
 of the omnipresent jinas,
1552
And you see the miraculous manifestation of the jinas in all realms. {17}
39. 64
“Your mind is as invincible as space.
You are primordially pure, unstained by the stains of the kleśas.
Within it appear all the realms of the three times
And the assemblies of all buddhas and bodhisattvas. {18}
39. 65
“Within each instant there are days and nights and months,
In each moment years and the creation and destruction of kalpas.
You know an ocean of kalpas, their ocean of names and numbers,
And the ocean of the perceptions of beings, within each instant. {19}
39. 66
“You know the births and deaths of beings in all directions,
Those with and without form, with and without perception, [F.159.a]
Those who follow the way of belief in reality.
You show them the path and bring them to supreme enlightenment. {20}
39. 67
“Manifesting from the family of Vairocana’s net
 of prayers,
1553
Born from the single body of all the sugatas,
Your unimpeded mind is the pure Dharma body,
And you manifest your form body in all worlds according to aspirations.”
{21}
39. 68
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having praised the night goddess Sarva-
nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī with these appropriate verses, bowed his
head to the feet of the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī,
circumambulated the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī
many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking
back again and again, departed from the night goddess Sarva nagara rakṣā-
saṃbhava tejaḥ śrī. [B10]

Chapter 40
SARVA VṚKṢPRAPHULLANA SUKHA- 
SAṂVĀSĀ
40. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, further meditating on, believing in,
and increasing the bodhisattva liberation called the entry into beautiful sounds
and profound manifestations, went to where the night goddess Sarva-
vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā was. He saw the night goddess Sarva-
vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā seated upon a lion throne consisting of the
saplings of precious trees, inside a kūṭāgāra made from the branches of all
perfumed precious trees and encircled by an entourage of ten thousand
night goddesses. [F.159.b]
1554
40. 2
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the night
goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā and then stood before her.
With his hands placed together in homage, he said, “Goddess, I have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, and so I
pray that you explain how bodhisattvas should practice bodhisattva
conduct, how they should train in it, and how, having practiced and trained
in it, they proceed toward omniscience!”
40. 3
The night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā said to Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, through my power, when the sun sets
in the Sahā world realm, the lotus blossoms close,
 the men and women
who are dedicated to delighting in pleasures in parks have the wish to
return to their homes, the beings who travel along roads and narrow paths
think of finding somewhere to stay for the night, and they turn their
attention to all the safe dwellings for beings. Those who dwell in forests, in
mountain clefts, and in caves enter their forests, clefts, and caves. Those
beings who dwell in trees think of returning to their homes in the trees.
Those beings who dwell in holes return to their holes. Those beings who
dwell in villages, towns, districts, and lands return to their villages, towns,
districts, and lands. Those beings who dwell in water enter the water. Those
1555


---

beings who have gone to lands in other directions begin to think of the
directions of their own lands in order to remain in a feeling of happiness
during the night.
40. 4
“Moreover, noble one, to the young men and women in the prime of life
who are intoxicated by youthfulness, intoxicated by the delights of singing,
dancing, and music, [F.160.a] who are dedicated to delighting in sensory
pleasures, to them I praise dedication to creating roots of merit as a remedy
for the fear of birth, old age, death, and the great darkness of ignorance. I
bring beings who are miserly to the practice of generosity. I bring beings
who have bad conduct to the practice of correct conduct. I praise love to
beings who have malicious minds. I establish beings with disturbed minds
in the practice of patience. I establish beings who are lazy in the practice of
undertaking bodhisattva diligence. I establish beings who have intoxicated
minds in the practice of dhyāna. I bring beings with poor wisdom to the
practice of the perfection of wisdom. I establish beings who aspire to the
lower yānas in the practice of the Mahāyāna. I establish beings who have
attachment to the three realms in the bodhisattva perfection of prayer, the
field of the ultimate conclusion of the paths of existence. I establish in the
perfection of bodhisattva strength those beings who are overpowered by
their objects of perception,
 are tormented by karma and kleśas, and have
weak merit and wisdom. I establish in the perfection of bodhisattva
knowledge those beings who are overwhelmed by the darkness of
ignorance and enveloped in the darkness of believing in a self and
possessions.
1556
40. 5
“Moreover, noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
arising of the vast radiating light of joy.”
40. 6
Sudhana asked, “Goddess, what is this bodhisattva liberation called the
arising of the vast radiating light of joy like?” [F.160.b]
40. 7
She answered, “Noble one, this bodhisattva liberation has the radiance of
the knowledge and methods of gathering beings through the merit of the
tathāgatas. Why is that?
40. 8
“Noble one, it is because all happiness that beings experience occurs
through the power of the merit of the tathāgatas, through the path of
instruction of the tathāgatas, through practicing the words of the tathāgatas,
through following the example of the tathāgatas, through the blessing of the
tathāgatas, through practicing the path taught by the tathāgatas,
 through
creating roots of merit in the same way the tathāgatas have, through the
power of the natural result of the Dharma that is taught by the tathāgatas,
and through illumination from the sun of the wisdom of the tathāgatas.
1557
40. 9
“Noble one, the happiness of beings arises from the light of the disk of
good qualities
 of the family of the tathāgatas. Why is that?

40. 10
“Noble one, it is like this: I realized this bodhisattva liberation called the
arising of the vast radiating light of joy when I remembered, comprehended, and
understood the ocean of the past bodhisattva conduct of the Bhagavat
Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Vairocana.
40. 11
“When, in the past, the Bhagavat was on the bodhisattva bhūmis, he
developed a motivation of great compassion on seeing beings with the belief
in a self, with the belief in possessions, enveloped in the darkness of
ignorance, wandering in the wilderness of thickets of wrong views, under
the power of craving,
 [F.161.a] imprisoned within the bondage of desire,
having thoughts of hatred caused by anger, with their minds disturbed by
ignorance, ensnared by jealousy and greed, with their minds disturbed by
kleśas, experiencing great suffering in saṃsāra, afflicted by the suffering of
poverty in saṃsāra, and having turned away from the sight of a buddha.
1559
40. 12
“He developed a motivation to benefit all beings through the
accumulation and possession of precious requisites in the world, a
motivation to produce necessary requisites for all beings, a motivation that
was without attachment to anything, a motivation that had no yearning for
anything in the entire field of perceptions, a motivation that had no clinging
to any pleasure, a motivation that had no longing for any enjoyment, a
motivation that had no wish for results ripening from generosity, a
motivation that had no longing for any worldly prosperity, a motivation that
was not
 oblivious of causes and conditions, a motivation that had the
understanding of the Dharma that was being sought, and a motivation that
had attained dedication to the benefit of all beings.
1560
40. 13
“In that way, he had a mind that understood the nature of all phenomena,
the realization of the impartiality of great love toward all realms of beings.
He had the activity of spreading clouds of great compassion over all worlds
of beings. He possessed a great round parasol of the Dharma that sheltered
all worlds of beings. [F.161.b] He possessed the thunderbolt weapon of great
wisdom that destroys the mountains of obscurations of all beings. His mind
had the increasing power of contentment through bringing happiness to all
beings. His mind prayed that all beings would attain the ultimate happiness;
he intended to send down a rain of wealth on all beings in accordance with
their wishes and aspirations. His mind never abandoned beings but was
focused on them all equally. He intended to satisfy all beings with the
wealth of the āryas. He intended that they attain the supreme, stainless,
precious knowledge of the ten strengths. He had attained the strength of the
higher cognitions of a bodhisattva. He filled the entirety of the realms of
beings and the vast realm of phenomena, as far as space extends, with great
clouds of various miraculous bodhisattva manifestations. He manifested his


---

presence before all beings and sent down a gift of great rain from a cloud of
every form and every kind of object of perception. He sent down rain from a
great cloud of every kind of precious jewelry.
40. 14
“In that way, so that all beings could have enjoyment according to their
own kind, he accomplished giving infinite, different kinds of things,
practiced countless different kinds of assistance, engaged in accumulating
all the many various kinds of gifts, practiced the conduct of giving away a
numerous variety of things, produced an indescribable array of different
kinds of requisites, and realized the way of infinite generosity that satisfies
beings according to their aspirations with an accumulation of various gifts
with various characteristics. [F.162.a]
40. 15
“Thus he gave, conferred, and bestowed all the things that would bring
contentment to beings according to their aspirations. He engaged in saving
all beings from continuous composite suffering. He had no wish for any
being to repay his kindness. He possessed the realization of the equality of
all beings, so that he purified the precious minds of all beings, and through
the methods of gathering beings that have arisen from the roots of merit of
all buddhas as a single ocean, he sent down a rain of requisites in
accordance with the wishes of all beings, and he increased the power of the
ocean of the merit of omniscience for all beings.
40. 16
“He accomplished this in order to purify the successive ripening and
guiding of all beings without exception in each instant of mind; in order in
each instant of mind to cover and adorn the succession of all realms without
exception with the pure adornments of the highest, undefiled buddha
realms; in order in each instant of mind to pervade and purify the ocean of
the ways of all phenomena without exception; in order in each instant of
mind to complete the way of wisdom that pervades the entire extent of space
without exception; in order in each instant of mind to purify the way of the
wisdom that comprehends all beings and times without exception; in order
in each instant of mind to attain the illumination of the way of the wisdom
that guides all beings without exception; [F.162.b] in order in each instant of
mind to irreversibly
 turn the wheel of the Dharma in all times without
exception; and in order in each instant of mind to benefit all beings through
revealing all skills, without exception, that are the blessing of omniscient
wisdom.
1561
40. 17
“He performed bodhisattva conduct in each instant of mind in all the
numbers of world realms without exception; in the arisen
 ocean of all
world realms; in the congregation of the ocean of all world realms; in the vast
extent of world realms of various descriptions; within the array of the
boundaries of various differentiated families
 of world realms with
boundaries; with descriptions of various bases and masses; in world realms
1562
1563


---

with descriptions of various divisions into kalpas; in world realms that were
defiled but also pure, pure but also defiled, entirely pure, and entirely
defiled, that were immense, vast, measureless, narrow, minute, and huge,
high, level, sideways, upside-down, facing the principal directions and the
intermediate directions, and located in the ocean of various directions; and in
an array of various shapes and entrances described in various ways.
40. 18
“He entered a bodhisattva’s faultlessness in order to spread widely his
bodhisattva conduct and miraculous manifestations, in order that in each
instant of mind other beings would perceive in their minds and thoughts all
the activity
 of the buddhas of the three times without exception, so that
all beings would accomplish increasing the ocean of merit of omniscience. I
know and I remember his accomplishment.
 [F.163.a]
1564
1565
40. 19
“Noble one, in that way, when the Bhagavat Vairocana was previously
practicing bodhisattva conduct, he had compassion for those dwelling in the
world, who were devoid of the accumulations of merit and wisdom, who
were filled with ingratitude toward other beings, who were enveloped by
the darkness of ignorance, who were attached to belief in a self and belief in
possessions, who were obscured by the darkness and blindness of
ignorance, who had inappropriate thoughts, who were deep
 in the
wilderness of thickets of wrong views, who were ignorant of cause and
results, who were under the power of kleśas and karma, who had fallen into
the underground world of the great suffering of saṃsāra’s wilderness and
were experiencing the various
 sufferings of poverty.
1566
1567
40. 20
“Having compassion for them, he praised establishing strong roots of
merit through a vast cloud of the practice of the perfections, dispelled
saṃsāra’s suffering of poverty in all beings, inspired them toward a great
accumulation of merit and wisdom, elucidated the aspect of the field of
causes, explained the aspect of actions that are in accord with the Dharma,
illuminated 
the 
aspect 
of 
understanding
 
the 
domain 
of 
the
Buddhadharma, elucidated the aspect of the aspirations of beings, taught the
aspect of the creation of the realms of beings, followed the aspect of the
uninterrupted family of all the buddhas, held the aspect of the teaching of all
the buddhas, dispelled the aspect of all bad qualities, described the aspect of
the accumulation of omniscience, [F.163.b] and filled all the realms of beings
with the great cloud of the perfections. Having accomplished that, he
satisfied beings in accordance with their aspirations, establishing beings in
the compilation of the Dharma; he inspired them toward the accumulation of
omniscience; he brought them to the great perfections of a bodhisattva; he
increased the ocean of the roots of merit of beings; he strengthened them
1568


---

through the attainment of the wealth of the āryas; and he increased the
ocean of the roots of merit of beings through the power of their aspiration for
omniscience.
40. 21
“He brought them to enter the gateways to the miraculous manifestations
of the tathāgatas, gathered them through possessing the bliss of the
pacification of the skandhas, made them aspire to the greatness that is the
nature of the tathāgatas, and established them in the wisdom possessed by
the bodhisattvas.”
40. 22
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, how long has it been since you entered upon the
highest, complete enlightenment?”
40. 23
She answered, “Noble one, this is a subject that is difficult to believe in,
difficult to know, difficult to aspire to, difficult to comprehend, difficult to
describe, and difficult to understand; the world and its devas and the
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas are unable to comprehend it. However,
through the blessing of the tathāgatas, through being in the care of a
kalyāṇamitra,
 those beings who have no yearning for any bliss in
saṃsāra, who are focused on the bliss of the tathāgatas, who are engaged in
ending the suffering and unhappiness of all beings, who aspire to the
knowledge
 that comprehends the ocean of the qualities of the tathāgatas,
[F.164.a] who have realized the nature of all phenomena and have space as
their field of activity, who are purified by the path of a vast aspiration, who
have turned away from the course of saṃsāra, who aspire to the ocean of
wisdom of all the tathāgatas, who are determined to go to the city of the
Dharma,
 who have the diligence to attain the field of activity of the
tathāgatas, who have the prowess to reach the level of the buddhas, who
aspire to the perfection of the power of omniscience, and who have fully
attained the ten strengths, with a mind supported by a vast accumulation of
merit and wisdom, with a pure motivation, with a mind that is not
disheartened, is not defiled, is not insincere, is unimpaired, has not
narrowed, and is not in darkness, with a mind that is illuminated by the light
of completely illuminating wisdom, with a mind intent on bringing
happiness and benefit to all beings, with a mind that cannot be defeated by
the kleśas and all Māra’s entourage, and with a mind that has the
opportunity to attain omniscient wisdom, are able to understand,
comprehend, believe in, grasp, follow, and know this subject.
1569
1570
1571
1572
40. 24
“Why is that? Noble one, this subject is the field of the knowledge of the
tathāgatas. All bodhisattvas, let alone all other beings, cannot reach it.
Nevertheless, through the blessing of the tathāgatas, I teach it so that noble
beings will have a perfectly pure motivation, so that beings with a conduct of
roots of virtue will have a superior motivation, and so that you will obtain
the arising of the true answer to your sincere
 question.” [F.164.b]

40. 25
Then, at that time, the night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha-
saṃvāsā, in order to teach this meaning further, looking into the field of
knowledge of the tathāgatas of the three times, recited these verses:
40. 26
“The profound, inconceivable field of knowledge of the buddhas
About which you, son of the buddhas, have asked a question
Cannot be entirely explained, even in as many kalpas
As there are atoms in countless realms. {1}
40. 27
“Beings who have desiring minds and those with angry minds,
And similarly those obscured by the darkness of ignorance
And those who are afflicted by hypocrisy and arrogance,
Are unable to know the peace of the true nature of the jinas. {2}
40. 28
“Those who are overpowered by and follow envy and jealousy,
Those who are polluted by thoughts of deception and deceit,
And those who are obscured by the obscuration of kleśas and karma
Are unable to know this field of the buddhas. {3}
40. 29
“Those who are established in the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas,
Those who are dependent on the destructible accumulation,
And those whose minds and views are aberrant
Are unable to know this level of the buddhas. {4}
40. 30
“The field of the jinas is a peace that is difficult to comprehend.
Its nature is stainless, and it is without conceptualization.
Those who are dependent on existence and cling to saṃsāra
Are not able to know this Dharma. {5}
40. 31
“This is the field for those ṛṣis
Of the family and born in the family
 of the buddhas,
1574
Who have been consecrated by all the tathāgatas
And are holders of the lineage of the Dharma king. {6}
40. 32
“Those who are never satisfied by an ocean of good qualities,
Who have been taken into the care of kalyāṇamitras,
And who have a cloud of aspiration focused on the strengths of the munis
Attain peace when they hear this. {7}
40. 33
“Those who have stainless, nonconceptual motivation,
Whose understanding is like a cloud of lamps ending darkness —
Those stainless ones have this field of activity
Throughout the main and intermediate directions, to the extent of space. {8}
[F.165.a]


---

40. 34
“They who have a motivation of compassion for the ocean of beings —
Their presence pervades the entire three times.
They follow every single being with love,
Entering this way of the jinas. {9}
40. 35
“Those who have a rapturous mind that is free of grasping
Are constantly dedicated to giving away everything.
They engage in activity with all beings equally
And have no attachment to this level of conduct. {10}
40. 36
“Those who are without defilements, with conduct free of transgressions,
Who are dedicated to practicing the teaching of the buddhas
And whose minds have repentance of wrongdoing
 —
1575
Those stainless ones have this field of activity. {11}
40. 37
“Those who have unshakable, steadfast minds,
Whose minds have realized the nature of phenomena,
Who have minds unhindered by an ocean of karma —
For them this liberation is inexhaustible. {12}
40. 38
“For those with minds that are never disheartened,
 never turn back,
1576
Those who have strong and powerful diligence,
With endless diligence for the accumulation of omniscience —
For those with excellent discipline, there is this field of activity. {13}
40. 39
“Those with minds of peace, minds at rest,
Who are in complete peace, unfevered,
Practicing an ocean of omniscient dhyāna —
For those who have become peaceful, there is this way. {14}
40. 40
“Those whose minds are freed from all attachment,
Whose minds have understood the nature of phenomena,
Who have realized the Dharma realm of the jinas —
For those who are lamps of wisdom, there is this way. {15}
40. 41
“Those whose minds have realized the nature of beings,
Whose minds have no attachment to the ocean of existence,
Who appear to the minds of beings like the reflections of the moon —
For those who are wise in the path, there is this liberation. {16}
40. 42
“Those who practice in all future realms
That arise from the ocean of the family of prayers [F.165.b]
Of the ocean of jinas who are in the three times —
For those who are completely good, there is this way. {17}

40. 43
“Those who through an ocean of the ways of the realm of Dharma
Enter into the entire ocean of worlds
In all the kalpas of creation and destruction —
For those who are free of conceptualization, there is this liberation. {18}
40. 44
“Those who see, in the atoms of the realms in all directions,
Countless buddhas at the foot of the kings of trees
Attaining enlightenment and guiding beings —
For those with vision free of attachment, there is this way. {19}
40. 45
“You have served kalyāṇamitras
Through a great ocean of kalpas
And so have come here, unwearyingly seeking the Dharma.
You are able to hold this when you have heard it. {20}
40. 46
“In order to purify your motivation,
Through the inconceivable blessing of the sugatas1577
This immeasurable field of Vairocana
Will arise without impediment from my words. {21}
40. 47
“Noble one, in a time in the past even beyond as many kalpas as there are
atoms in a world realm, there was an ocean of world realms called Maṇi-
kanaka parvata śikhara vairocana.
40. 48
“Noble one, in that ocean of world realms called Maṇi kanaka parvata-
śikhara vairocana there was a tathāgata by the name of Jñāna parvata dharma-
dhātu dikpratapana tejorāja. 
The 
Tathāgata 
Jñāna parvata dharma dhātu-
dikpratapana tejorāja, through his previous bodhisattva conduct, had
purified the ocean of world realms called Maṇi kanaka parvata śikhara-
vairocana.1578
40. 49
“In that ocean of world realms called Maṇi kanaka parvata śikhara vairocana
appeared as many ranges of world realms as there are atoms in the earth and
the mountains. In each range of world realms appeared as many groups of
world realms as there are atoms in a multitude of world realms. In each
world realm
 appeared as many kalpas as there are atoms in a world
realm. In each kalpa appeared numerous intermediate kalpas. [F.166.a] In
each intermediate kalpa appeared numerous world realms with different
appearances. In those appeared various occurrences of tathāgatas and their
miraculous manifestations. During each appearance of a buddha appeared as
many sūtras as there are atoms in a world realm. Within each sūtra appeared
as many prophecies to bodhisattvas as there are atoms in a world realm.
There appeared a vast extent of guided beings, without edge or center,
accomplishment through the ways of various yānas, and guidance through
various miraculous manifestations.
1579

40. 50
“Noble one, in that ocean of world realms called Maṇi kanaka parvata-
śikhara vairocana there was a central group of world realms called Samanta-
digabhimukha dvāra dhvaja vyūha.
40. 51
“Noble one, in that central group of world realms called Samanta-
digabhimukha dvāra dhvaja vyūha there was the world realm called Sarva-
ratna varṇa samanta prabhāsa śrī.
40. 52
“It had a display of basis and borders of world realms. It had the shining
bodhimaṇḍas of all the tathāgatas that were made of kings of jewels.
 It
resided upon an ocean of flowers of various jewels. Its main mass was made
of kings of precious jewels in which appeared the images of the emanations
of all the tathāgatas. It had the form of a city of devas. It was both pure and
defiled.
1580
40. 53
“In that world realm there were as many four-continent world realms as
there are atoms in Sumeru. The central four continents among those four
continents that were as numerous as the atoms in Sumeru was called Sarva-
ratna śikhara dhvaja. In that four-continent world called Sarva ratna śikhara-
dhvaja, each of the four continents was a hundred thousand yojanas wide.
[F.166.b] In each of those continents there were a thousand great cities. In
the center of the Jambudvīpa of that four-continent world there was a royal
capital called Ratna sāla vyūha megha pradīpā, which was encircled by ten
thousand cities.
40. 54
“At that time, the people of that Jambudvīpa had a lifespan of ten
thousand years. In the royal capital called Ratna sāla vyūha megha pradīpā
there was a cakravartin king by the name of Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra-
maṇḍala nirghoṣa. 
The 
cakravartin 
king 
Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra-
maṇḍala nirghoṣa had five hundred ministers. He had sixty thousand
queens. He had seven hundred sons who were all courageous and heroic,
with perfectly formed bodies, handsome and magnificent, and very strong.
40. 55
“During the time of King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa,
he protected all of Jambudvīpa under one parasol and vanquished all
enemies and opponents. During that time, in that world realm, as the
intermediate kalpa was ending, the five degenerations appeared, the path of
the ten good actions vanished, beings practiced the path of the ten bad
actions, and most went to the lower realms. Their following the path of bad
actions became the cause for lifespans to become short, pleasures to be few,
and bodies to be ugly, have a bad color, and be misshapen. There was little
happiness and the experience of many kinds of suffering. They deceived and
betrayed one another. They caused divisions between one another. They
engaged in harsh speech. They spoke incoherently. They were overcome by
overpowering desires. [F.167.a] They had the thoughts of angry minds. They
wandered in a wilderness of various thickets of wrong views. They clung to


---

desires that were contrary to the Dharma, and they were overcome by those
overpowering desires. They were encompassed by false Dharma. Therefore,
trees, plants, and harvests of food did not grow from the ground. The rain
did not come on time. For those beings, the grass, herbs, shrubs, forests,
orchards, and trees withered. They were afflicted by various illnesses.
Throughout the main and intermediate directions they had no protector, and
so they disrespected and were in contention with one another.
40. 56
“They all gathered together and went to the royal capital Ratna sāla vyūha-
megha pradīpā. They surrounded it, some with their arms upraised, some
with hands clasped together, some with their bodies trembling, some
collapsing,
 some falling with their heads on the ground, some with their
bodies stretched out on the ground prostrate, some kneeling, some waving
their arms in the air, some naked without clothes, some with an ugly
expression of the face and eyes. They stared at King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa and cried out in a great piteous clamor,
‘Your Majesty! We are in distress! The suffering of hunger and thirst pains
us! We are afflicted by various fears! We have no refuge! We have no
protector or last resort! We are walled around by suffering! We are losing our
lives! We are facing death!’
1581
40. 57
“In that way they wailed in various ways, crying out with various kinds of
voices, with various words, various unpleasant facial expressions, various
verbal expressions,
 terms of speech, and words from various dialects and
in various accents. [F.167.b].
1582
40. 58
“All the men and women, boys and girls of that royal capital, who were
tormented by hunger and thirst, whose bodies were devoid of jewelry, who
had no clothes and were naked, who were unsightly and discolored, whose
skin was cracked and rough, and who were suffering and unhappy, were in
distress, yearning for happiness, and afraid of suffering. Therefore, they
sought protection from the great wise being King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa as a refuge, perceiving him to be someone
through whom they could obtain happiness, perceiving him to be someone
through whom they could become free of suffering,
 perceiving him to be
someone through whom they could gain sustenance and obtain treasure,
perceiving him to be like the sight of a ford, perceiving him to be a ship,
perceiving him to be a great island of wisdom,
 perceiving him to be
someone through whom they could attain a great benefit, and perceiving
him to be someone through whom they could obtain all the joys and
happiness of higher existences.
1583
1584
40. 59
“When King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa heard the
great clamor of the wailing of numerous piteous cries from all around him,
he entered countless millions of gateways into great compassion. His mind


---

resting in the mental state that is the way of great compassion, he
contemplated one-pointedly for a moment and then spoke ten sentences of
great compassion. What were those ten? They were:
40. 60
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings have fallen into the abyss of saṃsāra and
are without a support. When can I become a refuge for these beings, who
have fallen into the great abyss of saṃsāra, and bring them to the level of the
tathāgatas?
40. 61
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings are oppressed by the torment of the kleśas
and have no refuge. When can I become a refuge for these beings, who are
frightened by various kleśas, without a refuge, and oppressed by the
torment of the kleśas, and establish them in irreproachable actions? [F.168.a]
40. 62
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings are overcome by the fear of old age and
death in this world and have no refuge. When can I become a refuge for
these beings, who have no refuge, and dispel all their fear of saṃsāra?
40. 63
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings are tormented by the various fears in this
world and have no recourse. When can I become a recourse for these beings,
who are tormented by the various fears in the world, and establish them on
the very happy and faultless path to omniscience?
40. 64
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings are enveloped in the darkness of ignorance
in the world, and their sight is obscured by doubts and uncertainty. When
can I become a lamp for these beings who have no refuge and dispel all the
darkness of their ignorance?
40. 65
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see these beings who are deprived of light. When can I
provide them with the light of great wisdom by revealing to them the
undarkened gateway to wisdom?
40. 66
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see beings, deprived of the brilliant light of wisdom, who are
polluted by envy and jealousy, deception and deceit. When can I establish all
beings in perfect purity and illuminate them with the brilliant light of the
highest wisdom?
40. 67
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see the world of beings, who are without guidance, without
a guide. When can I bring all beings into the ways of the ocean of the
Dharma and become their guide?
40. 68
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see the world of beings, within the current of the ocean of
saṃsāra, who are without a guide. When can I ripen and guide all beings in
every way, without missing the time for the blessing of the tathāgatas, and
become their guide? [F.168.b]
40. 69
“ ‘Oh! Alas! I see the world of beings is blind and without a guide. When
can I bring all beings into the way of unobscured omniscient wisdom and
become their guide?’

40. 70
“After he had spoken these ten sentences of great compassion, the great
bell of the royal capital was rung, and the great drum of the great gift-giving
was beaten. He declared, ‘I shall give whatever anyone desires, and I shall
bring satisfaction to all beings.’
40. 71
“In all the royal capitals throughout Jambudvīpa, and in all the villages,
towns, market towns, districts, countries, and cities, all the stores of
requisites were opened, and many different kinds of requisites were
arranged at all crossroads, at the junctions of three roads, and in streets, and
all beings were provided with the necessities of life.
40. 72
“All treasure houses and treasuries were opened, and a great
accumulation of a treasure of jewels was displayed. Many piles of various
jewels were heaped up.
40. 73
“Storehouses of food and drink, clothes, vehicles, flowers, garlands,
incense and perfume, powders, jewelry, and precious clothes of various
colors were opened.
40. 74
“There were mansions, divine palaces, and houses, adorned by beds,
seats, and clothing, with a perfection of all wealth and treasure, and a
display of kings of jewels that dispelled darkness with their brilliant
radiance.
1585
40. 75
“He emanated and displayed in each of those houses an emanation that
resembled his body, so that he could fulfill all the wishes and desires of
those beings.
40. 76
“In order to heal all the illnesses of all beings, he arranged the perfect
conditions of medicines, doctors, treatments, and the various requisites for
sustaining life. [F.169.a]
40. 77
“He also set out containers of different shapes, made of various precious
materials, that contained every kind of the variety of requisites: There were
containers made of diamond jewels that were filled with various kinds of
perfumed precious jewels. There were containers made of various perfumed
precious jewels that were filled with clothes of various excellent colors.
There were many chariots, set out throughout all the regions of the land, that
were of various shapes and colors and adorned with various jewels, that had
thoroughbred horses,
 oxen, and elephants
 —various precious chariots
that were worthy of a king, made enjoyable with all adornments and jewels,
set with various kinds of cushions, adorned with various jewels, covered
with various canopies, hung with strings of precious bells, and adorned with
upright parasols, banners, and flags. He commanded that villages, towns,
countrysides, and regions were to be given away.

the city called Maṇi śikhara tejas, there was a vast level area of immense
breadth, without any rise or fall. [F.169.b] It was pure and level ground free

a realm of all jewels. The ground was made from all jewels. All kings of
jewels were strewn over it. It was adorned by many adornments of precious
jewels. It was filled with various jewel flowers. Various extremely aromatic

the pure signs of a great being. He wore a crown that shone with jewels. His
body was as solid and indestructible as a powerful thunderbolt. His well-

him with palms together in homage.

maṇḍala nirghoṣa wished to obtain various necessities and various things.
They came from various families, they were various kinds of beings, they
had minds with various desires, they had various aspirations and wishes,
they had gathered from various regions, they were accustomed to various
ranges of enjoyments, they had minds that aspired for various kinds of
enjoyment, they had various kinds of intentions and ideas, they were from
various classes of humans, they had been born into various families, they
had come from various lands, they spoke various languages and with
various vocabularies, they gave rise to various fields of speech, they
supplicated for various things, and they spoke in various words and voices.

looking at —he alone is a great man of wisdom.’

“In expectation they thought, ‘He is supported by great merit, he is a
moon that is a great man, and he intends to perform a great act of
generosity.’

“When he saw the great gathering of supplicants who had been gathered
by a mind with the aspiration of a bodhisattva, who had been manifested by
a mind with the aspiration of a bodhisattva, he felt in his mind affection,
delight, and benevolence
 toward them. He perceived them to be his
kalyāṇamitras. [F.171.b] There arose in him a vast and powerful great
compassion. He also developed the powerful diligence that would never
turn back from satisfying all supplicants throughout future kalpas. There
also arose all-pervading clouds of the aspiration to be equally engaged in
generosity toward all beings.
1597
40. 89
“As soon as King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa saw those
supplicants, it caused him to experience a joy greater than attaining the
sovereignty of a cakravartin king of a billion-world universe for endless
kalpas; a joy greater than attaining the throne of the sovereignty of Śakra for
many quintillions of kalpas; a joy greater than attaining the throne of the
sovereignty of the lord of devas, Suyāma, for many quintillions of kalpas; a
joy greater than attaining the throne of the sovereignty of the lord of devas,
Saṃtuṣita, for many quintillions of kalpas; a joy greater than attaining the
throne of the sovereignty of the lord of devas, Sunirmita, for endless kalpas;

countless kalpas; a joy greater than attaining the throne of Brahmā and
enjoying the bliss of dwelling in the Brahmā paradise for endless kalpas; a
joy greater than attaining the bliss of the Ābhāsvara devas for endless

kalpas; a joy greater than attaining the bliss of the Śubhakṛtsna devas for an
unceasing, unequaled number of kalpas; and a joy greater than attaining the
bliss of peaceful liberation of the Śuddhāvāsa devas for kalpas without end.

“Noble one, it was like [F.172.a] a solitary
 man, filled with longing, who
has been separated for a long time from his father, mother, brothers, sisters,
friends, relatives,
 sons, daughters, and wife and is wandering in a
wilderness. He longs and longs to see them, and when he meets them he
never has enough of looking at them, and a great joy and affection arises
within him.

1599
40. 91
“Noble one, in the same way, the instant King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa saw those supplicants, a great powerful joy
arose in him. His mind was overpowered
 by bliss and happiness. He
experienced an intensely powerful delight. The power of a great joy arose in
him. The great strength of the power of faith in and aspiration for the
enlightenment of buddhahood increased. The heartfelt faith in omniscience
increased. The strength of his pure, superior aspiration for the Dharma of all
the buddhas increased. He became capable of attaining the powers of a
bodhisattva. There arose the great power of aspiration through his mind
being pervaded with joy. Through the vast power of his rapture, he became
deeply reverential in faculties and thoughts toward kalyāṇamitras.
1600
1601
40. 92
“Why was that? Because King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala-
nirghoṣa was engaged in undertaking attaining omniscience; he had set out
for omniscience; he was turned toward the gateway to omniscience; he was
engaged in focusing on bringing satisfaction to all beings; he was intent on
practicing entry into the ocean of the qualities of all the buddhas; he was
dedicated to destroying the mountain of all the obscurations from māras,
karma, and kleśas;
 he was prepared to respectfully obtain the teachings
of all the tathāgatas; [F.172.b] from his heart he was dedicated to
accumulating completely and totally an ocean of the roots of merit; the
continuum of his mind had transcended all attachment; he had no
attachment to any sensory object in the world; his field of activity was space,
which is the nature of phenomena; he perceived them to be worthy of
offerings; he perceived them to be kalyāṇamitras; he perceived them to be
rare; he perceived them to be those who do what is difficult; he perceived
them to be those who do much; he perceived them to be of the highest
benefit; he perceived them to be teachers of the path to enlightenment; he
perceived them to be ācāryas; and he perceived them to be teachers.

“In that way, wherever they came from,
 for whatever reason,
whenever they had assembled, however long they had been present,
whatever the things they were asking for, whatever their longings, whatever
they wished for, whatever they yearned for, whatever they desired,

whatever the things they sought, he satisfied those supplicants through the
gateway of generosity that was without any disapproval, that had a great
range of love, that was not dependent on what the supplicants would do
with what they received, that had the light rays of great generosity, and that
was united with the equality of all beings.
40. 94
“He gave food to those who wanted food. He gave drink to those who
wanted drink. He gave clothes to those who wanted clothes. He gave
flowers to those who wanted flowers. In the same way, he gave perfumes,
garlands, ointments, powders, robes,
 parasols, banners, flags, precious
materials, jewelry, seats, beds, houses, divine palaces, temples, orchards,
parks, forests for ascetics, cavalry, elephants, [F.173.a] chariots, infantry,
carriages, palanquins, steeds, gold, treasures, jewels, pearls, conches,
crystals, corals, gold nuggets, and silver.
1605
40. 95
“He opened, shared, and gave away all his own dwellings, divine palaces,
harem, court, and royal treasures. He said, ‘Take whatever you want!’ If they
wanted a land, he gave them a land; if they wanted a city, he gave them a
city; if they wanted a town, he gave them a town. Treating all beings equally,
he gave away everything he owned to those supplicants, and in giving away
everything presented
 it to them. [B11]

“At that time, there was a head merchant’s daughter by the name of
Ratnaprabhā, who had an entourage of sixty girls and had arrived at the site
of the great offering. She was beautiful, attractive, and pretty; she had the
most perfectly formed, magnificent color; she was the color of gold; her hair
was deep black; her eyes were a contrasting deep black and white; she had a
pleasant, beautiful aroma; she had the voice of Brahmā; she wore excellent
clothing; she was perfectly adorned in jewelry; she had mindfulness and
intelligence; she had joy and a sense of shame; she had perfect conduct and
costume; she had respect for the gurus; she acted with perfect mindfulness;
she had profound activities; she had received, retained, and comprehended
the Dharma; she was honest; she had created excellent roots of merit in the
past; the continuum of her mind was clear, as it had been moistened by the
Dharma; she had pure, virtuous thoughts; she had a vast aspiration; she had
space as her field of activity; she had a mind that rejoiced in benefiting
others; [F.173.b] she was turned toward the direction of seeing the buddhas;
and she aspired to omniscience.
40. 97
“Ratnaprabhā, the head merchant’s daughter, was standing with palms
together in homage, not far away, on the right-hand side of the lion throne of
King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa. She bowed down to the
king but did not take anything from him. Then she went to one side and
thought, ‘That I have been able to see and to be with this kind of
kalyāṇamitra is an excellent attainment.’

40. 98
“She perceived King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa to be a
kalyāṇamitra, perceived him to be a teacher, perceived him to be
compassionate, perceived him to be someone who benefits others, and
perceived him to be a buddha.
40. 99
“She attained the power of joy, aspiration, and enthusiasm, and with a
mind that was free of dissimulation, she removed her jewelry and, gazing at
King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa, threw it toward him,
scattering it on the platform at the foot of the lion throne. When she had in
that way scattered her jewelry, she made this prayer: ‘May I in the future
become the same as King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa,
who is a refuge for beings who have no protector and are enveloped in
darkness. May I know whatever Dharma he knows. May I set forth through
whatever yāna he has set forth. May I follow whatever path he has followed;
may I become just like him whose body gives unending pleasure when
gazed upon, who has a limitless entourage [F.174.a] and is undefeatable,
invincible, and unconquerable. Wherever he is born, may I also be reborn
there.’
40. 100
“King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa knew what her mind
was focused on and engaged with, and he said to her, ‘Girl, take whatever
you need! Girl, I am giving away all my possessions. I am engaged in
satisfying all beings.’
40. 101
“She thought, ‘King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa has
understood me,’ and gained an even greater faith in him. With that faith in
him, giving rise to the power of immense vast roots of merit, she recited
these verses to King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa:
40. 102
“ ‘In the past, in Sāla vyūha megha,
Before you, the lion king, were born,
There was no delight,
 no magnificence.
1607
It was like the dreadful land of the pretas. {22}
40. 103
“ ‘All the people wished to kill.
They stole and acted inappropriately.
They told lies and spoke harshly
And spoke slanderous and meaningless words. {23}
40. 104
“ ‘They had minds that craved the wealth of others.
They thought maliciously of all other people.
They had wrong views and a field of sinful activity.
Through misleading practices they fell into the lower existences. {24}
40. 105
“ ‘The people practiced what was not Dharma,
Obscured by the darkness of ignorance and stupidity,

Following wrong views, and having heretical viewpoints,
And therefore for many years the rains did not fall. {25}
40. 106
“ ‘When the rains did not fall, seeds died,1608
The harvests did not grow, trees did not grow,
Lakes, ponds, and streams dried up, [F.174.b]
And it was the same for all the forests and plants. {26}
40. 107
“ ‘When you, who have pure eyes, had not been born,
Every river, without exception, had dried up.
All orchards resembled desolate mountains,
And the ground was covered with white bones. {27}
40. 108
“ ‘When you gathered together a multitude of supplicants
And brought satisfaction to all those supplicants,
Great clouds gathered from all four directions,
Bringing satisfaction to all plains and lowlands. {28}
40. 109
“ ‘Since then there has been no thieving, robbery, or fraud.
There has been no murder and no executions.1609
No one has died because they had no protector.
You have become the protector for all beings who have none. {29}
40. 110
“ ‘Those humans who delighted in killing,
Who slew others and then drank their blood,
And those who ate one another’s flesh,
Through your great generosity now have benevolent minds. {30}
40. 111
“ ‘At that time, those who possessed clothes
Numbered no more than one hundred thousand.
The others covered their bodies with clothing of straw and leaves,
And at that time, all were tormented by hunger as pretas are. {31}
40. 112
“ ‘You were born as a protector for those without a protector.
Now even rice grows without being planted, without plowing.
Treasures are obtained from wish-fulfilling trees,
And men and women have become learned. {32}
40. 113
“ ‘In the past, for a month or half a month they would
Follow bad ways, working to accumulate to no avail.1610
But nowadays they have much jewelry and excellent clothing
And are always happy, like devas amusing themselves. {33}

“ ‘Previously, passionate men, with dreadful
 wrong conduct,

 wives of others,

They lied, spoke harshly, slandered, and spoke meaninglessly.

Made of precious materials and covered by a net of gold,
With a glorious center of treasure and a handle of beryl
And encircled by completely precious, excellent bells. {38}

Outshine all the music in this world.
They emit sounds like the aspects of the Buddha’s speech,
Resounding with the peaceful sounds of the Dharma. {39}

The wheels of the names of the ocean of wise ones,
Of the ocean of sugatas in the ocean of successive kalpas
In the realms in all directions, without exception. {40}

In correct sequence whatever the names
Of those who have appeared in the past, in one realm after another,

through a higher cognition of great beings, you are, without doubt,
established in the way to enlightenment.
40. 155
“ ‘My prowess in gathering together the beings of Jambudvīpa has proved
meaningful because someone like you, with your kind of knowledge, has
been born in my realm.’
40. 156
“Then King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa picked up with
his own hands a great, priceless, precious jewel, a multicolored precious
jewel that contained the lights of the stars, and priceless, precious clothing,
and gave them to the head merchant’s daughter Ratnaprabhā. He gave
various precious clothing to each of the girls in Ratnaprabhā’s entourage.
[F.177.b] He said, ‘Girl, take this precious clothing, keep it, and wear it
yourself!’
40. 157
“Then the head merchant’s daughter, Ratnaprabhā, accompanied by her
entourage, knelt with both knees on the ground, took up the precious
clothing with both hands, placed it on her head, withdrew, and put on that
precious clothing. All the girls in the entourage also each put on their own
precious clothing. When she had put on that precious clothing, accompanied
by her entourage of girls, she circumambulated King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa, keeping him to her right. The images of all
constellations and stars appeared on those precious clothes. When the

gathering of people saw her, they said, ‘Girl, your entourage of girls is as
beautiful as a night goddess adorned by the stars. You, encircled by them,
are even more beautiful.’ ”
40. 158
Then the night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā said to
Sudhana, “Noble one, what do you think? At that time, in that time, who was
King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa? Do not think that it was
anyone else, for at that time, in that time, it was this bhagavat tathāgata arhat
samyak saṃbuddha Vairocana who was King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra-
maṇḍala nirghoṣa.
40. 159
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Padmaprabhā, the queen of King Jyotiṣprabha and the mother of King Sarva-
dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa? Do not think that it was anyone
else, for at that time, in that time, Māyādevī was Padmaprabhā, the king’s
queen who took the miraculously born prince onto her lap.1621
40. 160
“Also, what do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Jyotiṣprabha, the father of King Sarva dharma nirnādacchatra maṇḍala-
nirghoṣa? Do not think that it was anyone else, for at that time, in that time,
Śuddhodana was the king named Jyotiṣprabha. [F.178.a]
40. 161
“Also, what do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Ratnaprabhā, the head merchant’s daughter? Do not think that it was
anyone else, for at that time, in that time, I was Ratnaprabhā, the head
merchant’s daughter.
40. 162
“Also, what do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who were
the beings who had been born in Jambudvīpa and whom King Sarva dharma-
nirnādacchatra maṇḍala nirghoṣa had gathered together through the four
methods of gathering pupils? Do not think that it was anyone else, for they
are those who are gathered in this assembly of the followers of the Bhagavat,
have been established on the bodhisattva path, and are progressing
irreversibly toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Some are
established on the first bhūmi, some on the second bhūmi, some on the third
bhūmi, some on the fourth bhūmi, some on the fifth bhūmi, some on the sixth
bhūmi, some on the seventh bhūmi, some on the eighth bhūmi, some on the
ninth bhūmi, and some are established on the tenth bodhisattva bhūmi.
40. 163
“They are bodhisattvas who have their attainments through various kinds
of prayers, various ways of setting out toward omniscience, various
accumulations, various accomplishments,
 various conducts,
 various
setting forths, various pure displays of the path, various supremacies in
miraculous manifestations, and different kinds of displays of the path.
1622
1623
40. 164
“They are these practitioners who are dwelling and practicing within
various divine palaces of the Dharma in this assembly of followers through
their practice of various kinds of liberations.”

40. 165
The night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā, in order to teach
further the bodhisattva liberation called the arising of the vast radiating light of
joy, recited these verses to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son: [F.178.b]
40. 166
“Son of the jinas, with my vast sight
I am looking into all directions
At the vast ocean of realms of various kinds
And also the ocean of beings in saṃsāra. {71}
40. 167
“I see the spotless jinas in the vast extent of all realms
Present everywhere throughout the ten directions
Seated at the feet of Bodhi trees,
Teaching the Dharma and guiding beings. {72}
40. 168
“With the pure ocean of my hearing,
I hear all sounds without exception.
All the Dharma that is taught by the sugatas
I hear with delight again and again. {73}
40. 169
“My nondual, unimpeded knowledge
Enters the field of the minds of other beings.
I comprehend the entirety of the characteristics1624
Of the vast ocean of the minds of other beings. {74}
40. 170
“Through the power of memory and samādhi
I know the ocean of countless kalpas in the past.
And similarly I know the ocean of the successions
Of the many lifetimes of myself and of others. {75}
40. 171
“I know in a single instant kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms,
The existences of beings within saṃsāra,
And the buddhas and their hosts of miraculous manifestations. {76}
40. 172
“I also remember the first aspirations
Made by the knowers of the world,
Their vast ways of attainment and engagement,
And how through conduct they accomplished the accumulations. {77}
40. 173
“In a single instant of mind I comprehend
The vast ways of enlightenment and buddhahood
Of all those who have reached the level of empowerment
Of having an ocean of unequaled, immeasurable qualities. {78}
40. 174
“I know how the sugatas, through various methods,


---

Turn the supreme wheel for beings,
The measureless qualities of their nirvāṇas,
And the length of time their Dharma remains. {79}
40. 175
“I comprehend individually, through various ways,
The ocean of the ways of their stainless yānas,
All their vast guidance for beings,
And the teachings they give to beings. {80} [F.179.a]
40. 176
“I have meditated for many hundreds of kalpas
On the way of this liberation of the illumination
Of the treasure of delight and the wealth of aspiration.1625
You too should quickly comprehend this way. {81}
40. 177
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the arising of the vast
radiating light of joy. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities
of bodhisattvas who at the feet of all the tathāgatas engage in an ocean of
prayers to enter omniscience; who complete the fulfillment of the ocean of
the past prayers by the tathāgatas; who are skilled in reaching the ocean of
all bodhisattva bhūmis through reaching one bodhisattva bhūmi; who have
pure prayer and conduct in which there is an ocean of all bodhisattva
conducts included within each conduct; who have the power of practice of
the entire ocean of bodhisattva liberations being included within each
bodhisattva liberation?
40. 178
“Depart, noble one. The goddess of the night who has the name Sarva-
jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā has come to this bodhimaṇḍa and is in
the presence of the Bhagavat. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a
bodhisattva ripen beings for the highest, complete enlightenment? How
should a bodhisattva purify all buddha realms? How should a bodhisattva
honor and serve all tathāgatas so as to please them? How should a
bodhisattva be dedicated to the Dharma
 of all the buddhas?’ ” [F.179.b]
1626
40. 179
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the night
goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā, circumambulated the night
goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā many hundreds of thousands
of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again,
departed from the night goddess Sarva vṛkṣpraphullana sukha saṃvāsā.

Chapter 41
SARVA JAGAD RAKṢĀ PRAṆIDHĀNA VĪRYA-
PRABHĀ
41. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went to where the night goddess Sarva-
jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā was. He saw the night goddess Sarva-
jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā in the center of her entourage, seated
upon a throne that contained kings of jewels that illuminated the dwellings
of all beings. She had a body covered completely in a net of jewels that
illuminated the ways of the realm of phenomena. Her body revealed the
images of the sun, the moon, and all the planets, stars, and constellations.
She had a body that manifested to the perception of beings in accordance
with their wishes. She had a body such that her own body was perceived by
all beings as having the same form as their bodies. She had a body that
manifested perceptions of a vast, centerless, edgeless ocean of skin colors.
She had a body that manifested practicing all paths of the practice of
conduct. She had a body that could be perceived from every kind of
orientation.
 She had a body that was present in all worlds, filling all
directions with the sound of thunder from the cloud of the Dharma and with
various miraculous manifestations. She had a body that reached throughout
the realm of space, at all times looking at how to benefit all beings. She had a
body that paid homage and bowed down at the feet of all tathāgatas. She
had a body that came before all beings, aiding them in the accumulation of
roots of merit. [F.180.a] She had a body that possessed the mindfulness of
keeping and never deviating from the motivation to accomplish and fulfill
the prayer to receive and possess clouds of Dharma directly from all the
tathāgatas. She had a body that filled all principal and intermediate
directions with light that had no edge or center. She had a body that
manifested the illumination and the spreading light of the lamp of Dharma,
dispelling the darkness in all beings. She had a body that manifested as a
stainless body of the wisdom that phenomena are like illusions. She had a
1627


---

body that manifested as a Dharma body free of darkness and dust. She had a
body that appeared with the nature of being an illusion. She had a mind free
of darkness that had realized the true nature. She had attained the
illumination in all aspects of the light of wisdom. She had a mental body that
was completely free of illness and had no pain. She had appeared from the
realm of the enduring and indestructible Dharma body. She had a body that
was the pure body of the stainless true nature, the state completely without
kleśas, and which had the nature of the unlocated blessing of the tathāgatas.
41. 2
When he had seen her, he bowed his head, and, remembering the ways of
seeing her, which were as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm, he
bowed down to the ground, prostrating himself for a long time.
 Sudhana,
the head merchant’s son, then stood up from the ground, placed his palms
together, and, looking at the body of the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā-
praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā, he gained ten pure perceptions, and through
gaining them he gained commonality with all kalyāṇamitras.
1628
1629
41. 3
What were those ten? [F.180.b] (1) He gained the perception of his own
mind being among the kalyāṇamitras in order to have all the diligence for
undertaking the attainment of omniscience. (2) He gained the perception of
the pure nature of the ripening of his own karma so as to attain the
accomplishment of vast roots of merit from honoring kalyāṇamitras. (3) He
gained the perception of the adornment of bodhisattva conduct so as to
remain in the conduct that is the adornment of all prayers. (4) He gained the
perception of the accomplishment of all the Dharmas of the buddhas so as to
practice the path of the instructions of all the tathāgatas. (5) He gained the
perception of the arising of sensations so as to see the radiance of practicing
the unsurpassable Dharma that is the field of all buddhas. (6) He gained the
perception of a single setting forth so as to have the pure conduct and prayer
of setting forth through the completely good conduct.
 (7) He gained the
perception of the origin of the ocean of the merit of omniscience so as to
increase the accumulation of all good qualities. (8) He gained the perception
of protecting, increasing, and completing incomplete
 good qualities so as
to increase the power of diligence for omniscience in the enlightenment of
buddhahood. (9) He gained the perception of the completion of all roots of
merit so as to fulfill the wishes of all beings. (10) He gained the perception of
the accomplishment of all goals among kalyāṇamitras so as to be established
in having the power of the qualities
 of all bodhisattvas. [F.181.a]
1630
1631
1632
41. 4
Those are the ten pure perceptions he gained. Having gained them, he
gained from the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā

buddha realm.

He attained those pure perceptions through looking at the night goddess
Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā. He attained these and other
commonalities, as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm, from the night
goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā.

41. 8
With his upper robe removed from one shoulder and with his palms

praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā and recited these verses:
41. 9
“I regard my own mind and my aspiration
To enlightenment to be firm and irreversible.
As it is in your mind, so it is in mine.
And that which is mine has today become firm. {1}
41. 10
“I have been purified of everything that is sinful;
I have attained the unequaled
 ripening of good karma.
1641
When I look and see you, beautiful one,
I accumulate inexhaustible
 good qualities. {2}
1642
41. 11
“My mind is adorned by a river of qualities.
Through dedication to benefiting beings in various ways,
I practice a conduct that is thus adorned
Within all realms until the last of future kalpas. {3}
41. 12
“Āryā, in order to show your kindness to me,
You have revealed the accomplishment of all Dharmas.
I pray that for my benefit
 you will decide to care for me
1643
And bestow on me the highest teaching of the Dharma. {4}
41. 13
“You have repelled the path of falling into lower existences.
You have shown the pure path to the higher existences.

You have taught the path
 to omniscience,
1644
Which is the way followed by every sugata. {5}
41. 14
“Incomparable, marvelous one, I have in your presence1645
Developed the supreme conception of setting forth.
The pure entranceway to the Dharma of omniscience
Is immeasurable and stainless, like space. {6}
41. 15
“Today I have developed the immeasurable perception of you
As the excellent source of immeasurable omniscience.
An ocean of merit as immeasurable as space
Arises in the mind with every instant. {7} [F.185.a]
41. 16
“Āryā, I pray you empower me with the perfections.
I pray that you augment inconceivable merit.
Having augmented all goodness and qualities,
Cause me to quickly attain the level of omniscience. {8}
41. 17
“I constantly perceive the kalyāṇamitras
As the complete path to omniscience.
Therefore they will be made content
By my quickly perfecting all good qualities.
 {9}
1646
41. 18
“Therefore, from this come all benefits
And the accomplishment of good qualities.
I shall accomplish this path to omniscience
And proclaim it to beings through infinite praises. {10}
41. 19
“You are my teacher of immeasurable qualities.
You are my guide toward the qualities of omniscience.
Āryā, even in countless quintillions of kalpas
I will not be able to repay your kindness.” {11}
41. 20
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having recited those verses, said to
the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā, “Goddess, if you
teach me this inconceivable scope of your bodhisattva liberation, then,
goddess, what is the name of this liberation? Goddess, how long has it been
since you entered upon attaining the highest, complete enlightenment?
How long will it be before you attain the highest, complete enlightenment of
buddhahood?”
41. 21
The night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā said to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, this liberation is called the
origin of the roots of merit that inspire the ripening of all beings. Noble one, through
possessing this liberation, having realized the equal nature of all

images within the existences of worlds while not being dependent on
beings; colors that purify the great strength of wisdom; colors that remember
and accompany all worlds; colors like those of all jewels; colors that manifest
the essence of brightness; colors that accord with the aspiration of all beings;

manifestations through blessings; colors that manifest the rising of the
power of the supremacy of manifestations through all miraculous powers;

into an ocean of the ways of the realm of all Dharmas free of transgressions;

treasures of powders and pervade throughout the ten directions of the ocean
of the ways of the entire realm of phenomena, and through having acquired

the blessing of the tathāgatas I manifest to beings who are guided through
seeing, who are guided through hearing, who are guided through
remembering, who are guided through creating emanations of Dharma
wheels, who are guided through the time having come for their ripening,
who are guided through the manifestation of form bodies, who are guided
through acts of veneration, who are guided through realization, who are
guided through manifesting various miracles and emanations, and who are
guided through manifesting the perception of countless miracles and
emanations, through the power of their aspirations, the power of the time,
the power of turning them away from bad actions, the power of establishing
them in the accomplishment of good actions, the power of accomplishing the
karma of great prayers of the past, the power of the might of omniscience,
the power of the qualities of attaining the miraculous manifestations of vast
bodhisattva liberations, the power of the arising of the strength of great
compassion that creates a refuge for all beings, and the power of the
aspiration that creates a pure ocean of great love.
41. 22
“Noble one, in that way I am established in this bodhisattva liberation
called the origin of the roots of merit that inspire the ripening of all beings, and
comprehending the true nature of phenomena
 to be without division, I
manifest the shapes and colors of bodies without limit or center, [F.188.a] and
from each manifested body come the perceptions within worlds of an
endless and centerless ocean of colors, and from each manifested color
clouds of light rays without limit or center are radiated, and from each light
ray the images of buddha realms without limit or center are manifested, and
in each buddha realm tathāgatas without limit or center are manifested, and
each tathāgata manifests buddha miracles without limit or center, and thus I
inspire those who have
 past roots of merit, and I cause those who have
not generated roots of merit to generate them, those who have generated
them to increase them, and those who have increased them to make them
vast.
1655
1656
41. 23
“In each instant of mind, I establish realms of beings without limit or
center on the level of irreversible progress toward the highest, complete
enlightenment. [B12]
41. 24
“Moreover, noble one, you asked, ‘How long has it been since you entered
upon attaining the highest, complete enlightenment? For how many
hundreds of kalpas have you been practicing bodhisattva conduct?’
Through the blessing of the buddhas I will teach you the answer.
41. 25
“Noble one, the domain of wisdom of the bodhisattvas is a field of
perception without thoughts, concepts, or assumptions.
 There is no
establishment or description of saṃsāra as being long or being short. There
1657
1658


---

is no establishment or description of defiled kalpas, pure kalpas, short
kalpas, great kalpas, numerous kalpas, [F.188.b] differing kalpas, a variety of
kalpas, or irregular
 kalpas.
1659
41. 26
“Why is that? Noble one, the domain of wisdom of the bodhisattvas
naturally has a completely pure nature, is free of all nets of
conceptualization, has transcended all the mountains of obscurations, and,
arising in their aspirations, illuminates all beings whom it is time to ripen
and guide accordingly.
41. 27
“Noble one, it is like this: the disk of the sun itself has no enumeration of
and does not exist as days and nights, but when it sets, that is perceived as
sunset,
 and when the disk of the sun rises, that is said to be daytime.
1660
41. 28
“Noble one, in that way, in the domain of wisdom of the bodhisattvas
there are no thoughts, concepts, or assumptions; there are also no
perceptions of residing in saṃsāra and no division into times. However,
through the power of the time for ripening all beings, that domain of wisdom
without concepts that arises from the aspiration of the bodhisattvas has the
enumeration of numbers concerning the duration of kalpas and the
perceptions of saṃsāra. There is the enumeration of the duration of past and
future kalpas in the conceptless domain of wisdom.
41. 29
“Noble one, it is like the analogy of the disk of the sun in the realm of
space, which appears as a perceived image on all jewel mountains, all jewel
trees, all jewel vessels, all jewel quarries, all oceans, all lakes and ponds,
[F.189.a] in all bowls of water, and to all beings. It appears as a direct
perception for all beings. The image of the disk of the sun appears in the
atoms of all jewels, but the disk of the sun is not present in the mountains of
jewels, does not enter the jewel trees, and so on, up to atoms of jewels, is not
contained within precious stones, does not come to jewel quarries, does not
enter oceans, and does not go into bowls of water, yet it appears within
them.
41. 30
“Noble one, in that same way, bodhisattva mahāsattvas have risen high
above the ocean of saṃsāra and are in the sky of the realm of Dharma of the
tathāgatas, active within the field of activity that is the sky of the nature of
phenomena, and dwell in the realm of the sky of peace. However, in order to
ripen and guide all beings in all the paths of existence and births, they
appear in bodies that are the same as those of all beings, but without being
stained by the faults of saṃsāra, without being accompanied by thoughts
and concepts, without the perception of a kalpa being long, and without the
perception of a kalpa being short.
41. 31
“Why is that? Because bodhisattvas have transcended error, have
transcended erroneous perception, mentation, and views, have comprehend
all worlds to be like dreams, [F.189.b] realize all worlds to be like magical


---

conjurations, have attained the realm of the wisdom that there are no beings,
view all phenomena exactly as they truly are, and, through the power of the
vast domain of compassion and of great prayers, appear to all beings in
order to ripen and guide all beings.
41. 32
“Noble one, it is like the analogy of a ship on a great river, and so on,
which is continuously engaged in ferrying beings across. It does not stay at
the opposite shore, it does not stay at the near shore, and it does not remain
in between.
41. 33
“Noble one, in the same way, bodhisattvas, through the power of the ship
of the great perfections, are engaged in ferrying beings across the flow of the
river of saṃsāra, doing so without fear of the near shore and without a
conception of the bliss of the far shore. Yet they are continuously engaged in
the practice of bringing all beings to liberation while maintaining
bodhisattva conduct throughout countless kalpas without attachment to the
different kinds of kalpas. They do not practice bodhisattva conduct with the
perception that the passing of a kalpa is a long time.
41. 34
“Noble one, it is like the analogy of the realm of space that is the domain of
the sky, the vast realm of phenomena, which though it includes the creation,
destruction, and passing of all world realms is without thought and is
naturally pure and completely undefiled, undisturbed, unobscured, and
unwearied by possessing all realms throughout all future time. [F.190.a]
41. 35
“Noble one, in the same way, the domain of the space of the wisdom of
bodhisattvas’ aspiration, with the revolving of the circle of the wind of great
prayers, holds back beings from all the abysses of the lower existences
without ever wearying; it brings them onto the path to happiness without
being disheartened, brings them onto the path to omniscience without
becoming despondent, is undisturbed by any kleśas, and is not afflicted by
any of the harms of saṃsāra.
41. 36
“Noble one, it is like the analogy of a man, with all the larger and smaller
parts of the body complete, who is a magical conjuration and in whose body
ten qualities are absent. What are those ten? They are (1) inhalation, (2)
exhalation, (3) cold, (4) warmth, (5) hunger, (6) thirst, (7) happiness, (8)
unhappiness, (9) birth, aging, sickness, and death,
 and (10) injury.
1661
41. 37
“Noble one, in the same way, bodhisattvas have forms that emerge as the
magical conjuration of wisdom; they have bodies that are not separate from
the realm of the Dharma, and which are born in order to ripen all beings in
the classes of existence within saṃsāra.1662
41. 38
“Although they are present in all kalpas, there are ten qualities that they
do not have.


---

“What are those ten? They are (1) delight in saṃsāra, (2) sadness on being
reborn within a class of existence within saṃsāra, (3) dedication to the
pleasures of the senses, (4) an angry mind, (5) desire for enjoyments, (6)
being afflicted by all the kleśas, (7) experiencing the sensation of suffering,
(8) fear through being born in frightening existences, (9) yearning for an
existence, and (10) clinging to an existence.
41. 39
“However, noble one, I shall also teach, through the blessing of the
buddhas, in order to increase the power of the vast bodhisattva prayers of
future bodhisattvas. [F.190.b]
41. 40
“Noble one, in the past, in times gone by, beyond as many kalpas as there
are atoms in an ocean of world realms, and even further beyond, there was at
that time, in that time, a world realm called Ratnaprabhā.
41. 41
“Noble one, in that world realm called Ratnaprabhā there was kalpa called
Suprabha. In that kalpa called Suprabha there appeared ten thousand
buddhas.
41. 42
“Noble one, the first of those ten thousand buddhas in that kalpa who
appeared in that world was the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha
Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, who was one with wisdom
and conduct,
 a sugata, one who knows the world’s beings, an
unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a teacher of devas and humans, a
buddha, and a bhagavat. He was the first of them all to attain the highest,
complete enlightenment of buddhahood.
1663
41. 43
“Noble one, that tathāgata appeared not far from the royal capital named
Rativyūhā in the central four-continent world. To the east of the royal capital
Rativyūhā, there was a forest called Suprabha. In Suprabha Forest there was
a bodhimaṇḍa called Ratna kusuma megha. At that bodhimaṇḍa called Ratna-
kusuma megha there appeared a lion throne on which there was a shining
jewel lotus.
 It was upon this that the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha
Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja 
attained 
the 
highest,
complete enlightenment of buddhahood.
1664
41. 44
“At that time, in that time, the lifespan of humans was ten thousand years,
but there occurred killing, [F.191.a] stealing, sexual misconduct, lying,
slander, harsh speech, meaningless talk, avariciousness, maliciousness, and
wrong views, and in that way the path of the ten bad actions became
widespread and enduring.
41. 45
“The 
Bhagavat 
Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja
remained
 at the bodhimaṇḍa, teaching the Dharma to bodhisattvas,
 in
order to ripen the roots of merit of the lords of the world and Jambudvīpa
humans who had served past jinas.
1665
1666

41. 46
“At that time, in that time, in the royal capital Rativyūhā, there lived King
Jayaprabha, who in order to subdue them imprisoned many hundreds of
thousands of people who had stolen, robbed, performed criminal acts, killed,
performed sexual misconduct, lied, slandered, spoken harshly, and talked
meaninglessly, who were avaricious, were malicious, held wrong views,
were attached to desires contrary to the Dharma, were overwhelmed by
irresistible desires, were encompassed by wrong Dharma, and who
committed sinful actions, acted wrathfully, did not create merit, did not
save
 those who were in fear, did not respect their mothers, did not
respect their fathers, were not reverential to mendicants, were not
reverential to brahmins, were not respectful of āryas,
 and committed
transgressions.
1667
1668
41. 47
“King Jayaprabha had a son whose name was Vijitāvin. He was
handsome, attractive, a delight to see, and he had a very beautiful, perfect,
magnificent complexion. He had twenty-eight of the signs of a great being.
He went up on the roof of the palace called Sarasvati saṃgīti, [F.191.b] where
he stayed, encircled by an entourage of many women. He heard the terrified
cries of the beings who had been put into prison and were tightly bound by
various instruments. On hearing them he became unhappy, and his mind
was not at ease. Great compassion arose in him, and he descended from the
roof of the palace. He entered the prison and inside that strict prison saw the
beings who in darkness were imprisoned, bound in wooden stocks, chains,
manacles, and fetters and chained one to another. It was thick with blinding
smoke, and they were stricken by unpleasant sickening air, breathing with
difficulty, tormented by hunger and thirst, and naked, without clothes, their
bodies entirely covered in dirt and dust, their bodies covered by their own
hair, their thighs tightly bound together; they were overwhelmed by a
sensation of the suffering of a series of various torments, and in their
suffering they cried out with unendurable wailing and screams.
41. 48
“When he saw this, a great compassion arose in him along with a
motivation to help others. He reassured them, saying, ‘I will free from prison
all those who have been placed in the darkness of this prison,’ thus giving
them the gift of freedom from fear.
41. 49
“He went to King Jayaprabha and said to him, ‘Your Majesty, I request
your attention. Taking pity on those beings who are in the unhappiness of
being imprisoned, I have given them the assurance of freedom from fear.
Please release them.’
41. 50
“King Jayaprabha gathered together his five hundred ministers and asked
them, ‘What do you think?’ [F.192.a]1669


---

“They said, ‘All these prisoners have stolen from the king’s treasuries,
have attempted to harm the king, have trespassed into your harem, and so
on. They should be executed. Their punishment should be execution or to die
in chains. Someone who undertakes to help them is committing a crime
against the king.’1670
41. 51
“Prince Vijitāvin, giving rise
 to an overwhelming compassion, said to
those ministers, ‘Let it be as you have just said. I will endure all their
experiences of suffering for their sake. Do to me whatever you would do to
them and set them free! I will undergo every kind of unhappiness in order to
free them from prison. I will even give up my body and life. Why is that? If I
am unable to free even these beings from prison, how would I be able to
liberate beings who are imprisoned in the three realms, who are bound by
the noose of craving, who are within the darkness of ignorance, who have
been cast into the darkness of stupidity, who are tormented by the suffering
of poverty, who are distressed in the deep abyss of the lower existences,
whose bodies have unpleasant shapes and ugly color, who are lacking in the
functioning of the senses, who have bewildered minds, who do not see a
way out of saṃsāra, who are devoid of light, who cling to the three realms,
who lack the accumulations of merit and wisdom, who are deprived of a
basis for wisdom, whose minds are stained by various kleśas, who are
trapped in an enclosure of suffering, who are under the power of Māra, and
who are tormented by birth, aging, sickness, death, misery, wailing,
suffering, unhappiness, and tribulation?’ [F.192.b]
1671
41. 52
“Prince Vijitāvin could not be dissuaded from freeing those imprisoned
beings by offering up himself, by offering everything, and by ransoming
them with his entourage and all his accumulation of wealth, and then taking
on the suffering of those beings.
41. 53
“Then the five hundred ministers, wailing with their arms upraised, went
to King Jayaprabha and said to him, ‘Your Majesty, we request attention.
Prince Vijitāvin’s plans will destroy the kingdom!
 We are even concerned
for our own lives! If Your Majesty does not restrain the prince, before long
Your Majesty’s life will be taken from you!’
1672
41. 54
“Then King Jayaprabha became angry and condemned to death Prince
Vijitāvin and all those people who were criminals.
41. 55
“When his birth mother heard this, she was distressed and, with her
entourage of a thousand women with their hair in disarray, their jewelry cast
aside, and their faces scratched, beating their breasts, with their heads
covered with dirt, and wailing with piteous cries, came into the presence of
the king, and she and her entourage bowed down at his feet and made this
supplication: ‘Your Majesty, listen to our plea! Free Prince Vijitāvin! Spare
the life of Prince Vijitāvin!’


---

41. 56
“Then the king had Prince Vijitāvin brought before him and said to him,
‘Prince, abandon those people who are criminals! If you do not abandon
them, you will be executed in their stead!’ [F.193.a]
41. 57
“The prince was not disheartened or discouraged but was engaged in
attaining the goal of omniscience, was dedicated to benefiting others, was
led in all his actions by compassion, and accepted his death.
41. 58
“His mother requested King Jayaprabha to give him half a month, saying,
‘I request that this prince be allowed to perform acts of charity for half a
month, and after that you may do as you wish.’
“The king gave his permission, saying, ‘Let it be so!’
41. 59
“The prince went to the great park called Sūrya prabha, which was to the
north of Rativyūhā, the royal capital, and was the traditional location for
offerings and acts of charity. There the prince gave anyone whatever they
wanted, making unconditional offerings and gifts of every kind for half a
month. He gave food to those who wanted food, gave drink to those who
wanted drink, and likewise gave steeds, clothes, flowers, powders,
ointments, Dharma robes, parasols, banners, flags, precious jewelry,
 all
ornaments, and every kind of necessity that was wished for.
1673
41. 60
“When the last day arrived, an assembly of many
 beings gathered. The
king’s ministers, the group of queens, the head merchants, the
householders, the people of the land, and the Jains assembled.
1674
41. 61
“The Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha-
pradīpa rāja, knowing it was the time to guide and ripen beings, also went to
the site of the distribution of gifts. A gathering of lords of the devas was his
entourage; lords of the nāgas made offerings to him; [F.193.b] lords of the
yakṣas were bowing to him; lords of the gandharvas were praising him;
lords of the asuras were bowing down to him; lords of the garuḍas, who
were adorned by crest jewels, were with delight strewing offerings; lords of
the kinnaras made offerings with joy and sang inspirational songs of praise;
and lords of the mahoragas encircled him, gazing at his face.
41. 62
“That great gathering of beings and Prince Vijitāvin saw, approaching
from afar, the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Dharma-
cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, who was handsome and delightful
to look at, with pacified senses and a pacified mind, withdrawn,
victorious over the senses, as tame as an elephant, as pure, clear, and
unpolluted as a lake, beautified by buddhahood’s emanations and great
miraculous manifestations and by the powerful supremacy of buddhahood,
and shining with the greatness of buddhahood. His body was beautifully
adorned by the adornments of the physical signs and features of a buddha,
and he was filling all worlds with the illumination of a buddha’s halo of
light, illuminating with a buddha’s light rays, emanating a field of the
1675


---

spreading aroma of precious perfumes from all his body’s pores, and
shaking all world realms in the manner of shaking buddha realms. He was
approaching while sending down a rain from a cloud of all adornments, with
the prowess of buddhahood, with the conduct of buddhahood that
eliminates kleśas within all beings, and through the sight of the buddha’s
face increasing the power of joy in all beings, [F.194.a] who on seeing the
tathāgata gained faith in their minds in the tathāgata.
41. 63
“Then Prince Vijitāvin and the great gathering of beings went to greet in
the distance the Bhagavat Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja,
and with faith in him they prostrated with their whole bodies, touching the
tops of their heads to his feet. They offered various kinds of offerings to him
and said, ‘Come, Bhagavat! Come, Sugata! Tathāgata, pay heed to us!
Tathāgata, take us into your care!’
41. 64
“Then Prince Vijitāvin prepared an excellent seat for the Bhagavat and
said to him, ‘Bhagavat, I request that you be seated upon this seat that has
been arranged for you.’
41. 65
“The Bhagavat approached it, and, through the blessing of the buddha,
the types of devas who were devoted to cleanliness of the body transformed
the seat so that it had in its center a lotus of the king of precious perfumes.
41. 66
“The Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha-
pradīpa rāja, sat upon that seat, and bodhisattvas sat upon the surrounding
seats. The beings of that assembly, as soon as they saw his face, became
freed from all obscurations; all their illnesses ceased, and they became
vessels for the Dharma of the āryas.
41. 67
“Then the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha-
pradīpa rāja, knowing that those beings had become ready vessels, gave the
teachings in stages. He taught the sūtra called The Illumination of the Field of
Causes. [F.194.b] He spoke through the entire ocean of the languages of
beings, definitions, and sounds of the voice, speaking with the thousands of
aspects of speech and possessing the thousands of aspects of the Dharma.
41. 68
“At that moment, eight hundred million beings within that assembly
became free of impurities, became stainless, and developed the Dharma
vision of the Dharma; many millions of beings attained the state beyond
training; and ten thousand beings were guided into the Mahāyāna. Thus
they entered into the way of completely good bodhisattva conduct and
accomplished great prayers.
41. 69
“When the Bhagavat this time turned the wheel of the Dharma through
the great miraculous powers of buddhahood, beings in the ten directions, as
numerous as the atoms in a hundred thousand buddha realms, were guided
into the Mahāyāna; beings without end or middle throughout the extent of


---

the various worlds and buddha realms were turned away from the lower
existences, and beings beyond number were brought onto the path to rebirth
in the higher existences.
41. 70
“Prince Vijitāvin also attained this bodhisattva liberation called the origin of
the roots of merit that inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the ripening of all
beings.1676
41. 71
“Noble one, at that time, in that time, there was the prince named Vijitāvin
who gave up his own body and life, his accumulation of wealth, his entire
entourage, and the happiness of living in the human world and freed those
beings who were in prison, [F.195.a] made an unrestricted great distribution
of gifts and offerings, honored the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak-
saṃbuddha Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, and, when he
saw the face of that tathāgata, developed the aspiration for the highest
complete enlightenment and attained this bodhisattva liberation called the
origin of the roots of merit that inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the
ripening of all beings. If you think he was anyone else, noble one, do not see
him in that way. At that time, in that time, I was the prince named Vijitāvin.
In that way, I was the prince named Vijitāvin, who became saddened
because of great compassion and who engaged in benefiting all beings
without any hope of not remaining in the three realms or of having a karmic
result in return; without any delight in fame, renown, or a great name;
without praise for oneself; without criticizing others; without attachment to
anything; having risen above the perceptions of existence; without
delighting in the three realms; while turning away from the pleasures of the
sensory field of the world, perceiving the field of the tathāgatas, having the
pure motivation of the bodhisattvas, having created the thunderbolt of the
superior motivation, and dedicated with great love to all beings; through
compassion
 for all beings undertaking the ending of suffering; with a
sincere focus on the strengths of the tathāgatas; and while training in the
path of the bodhisattvas, [F.195.b] adorning the path that brings forth the
displays of the Mahāyāna, and gazing upon the gateway
 into
omniscience, in that way accomplishing actions that are difficult
 to do.
1677
1678
1679
41. 72
“Noble one, that is how long it has been since I attained this bodhisattva
liberation called the origin of the roots of merit that inspire, in accordance with their
dispositions, the ripening of all beings.
41. 73
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that anyone else was at that
time, in that time, the five hundred ministers who made a perverse request to
King Jayaprabha and gave their counsel so that I would be executed, do not
see them in that way. They were the five hundred men sent by Devadatta to
assassinate the Bhagavat.


---

41. 74
“The Bhagavat has prophesied that they too will attain the highest,
complete enlightenment in a future time, after as many kalpas as there are
atoms in Sumeru, in a kalpa called Suprabha, as five hundred buddhas with
various qualities and displays of a buddha realm, born into various clans and
castes; with mothers and fathers with various names; manifesting various
miraculous births; with various miraculous settings forth into homelessness;
manifesting various lights from Bodhi trees; having various gateways into
going toward bodhimaṇḍas; manifesting various defeats of Māra;
manifesting various miraculous attainments of buddhahood; having various
ways of turning the Dharma wheel, of terms, and of definitions; teaching
various ways of the sūtras; teaching with various kinds of speech and voice;
having an array of various assemblies of followers; radiating the various
displays and powers
 of their halos of light; [F.196.a] having various
lifespans; having various blessings from their teachings; their teachings
having various objectives; having various names; and all having bodies of
great compassion.
1680
41. 75
“The first in that kalpa will be a tathāgata by the name of Mahākāruṇika,
who will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood in a
world realm called Ratnaprabhā. After him, in that same world, there will be
the second tathāgata called Sarva jagad dhita praṇidhāna candra. The third
tathāgata will be called Mahā karuṇā siṃha. The fourth tathāgata will be
called Sarva loka hitaiṣin. The last of them all will be a tathāgata called
Vaidyarāja.
41. 76
“Noble one, as for the men who were criminals at that time, in that time,
who had committed offenses against the king, and whom I freed from
imprisonment by going to the executioners and giving up my life and body,
if you think that they were anyone else, do not see them in that way. They
were the tathāgatas of the Bhadra kalpa, beginning with Krakucchanda, and
also countless millions
 of bodhisattvas, who upon seeing the Bhagavat,

“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that King Jayaprabha at that
time, in that time, was anyone else, do not see him in that way. The great
teacher Satyaka was at that time, in that time, King Jayaprabha.

“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that King Jayaprabha’s
retinue of queens in the harem, the sentinels at the harem entrance, and his
court and attendants at that time, in that time, were anyone else, do not see
them in that way. They were these six thousand Jains whom Satyaka

brought before the Bhagavat, who came to debate against the Bhagavat so as
to possess the victory banner of teaching, and when they came, the
Bhagavat 
prophesied 
their 
attainment 
of 
the 
highest, 
complete
enlightenment, telling them that they would come into a world as tathāgatas
with the arrays of various realms, in various kalpas, and with various names.

“Noble one, Prince Vijitāvin’s father and mother gave him permission, so
that after he freed those beings from prison, he cast aside the pleasure of
existence, the good fortune of wealth and precious treasuries, abandoned
children and wives, and entered mendicancy under the Bhagavat, the
Tathāgata Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja. After entering
mendicancy he maintained celibacy for five thousand years.
41. 80
“During that time he accomplished ten thousand gateways into samādhi,
[F.197.a] he attained ten thousand gateways into the power of mental
retention, he entered ten thousand ways of higher cognition, he attained ten
thousand bodhisattva treasures,
 he developed ten thousand powers of
omniscience, he purified ten thousand gateways into patience, he
accomplished ten thousand realizations through contemplation, he
multiplied ten thousand bodies with the strengths of a bodhisattva, he
entered ten thousand gateways into the knowledge of a bodhisattva, he
developed ten thousand ways of the perfection of wisdom, he perceived ten
thousand gateways for looking at the buddhas in the directions, and he
accomplished ten thousand bodhisattva prayers.
1682
41. 81
“Possessing such qualities in each instant of mind, he could arrive in ten
thousand buddha realms. In each world realm, in each instant of mind, he
could remember ten thousand past and future buddhas. He could see and
know ten thousand oceans of emanations from each of those buddhas going
into the ten directions.
41. 82
“In each instant of mind, he could see all the beings within those ten
thousand buddha realms. He knew their birth into various existences, their
passing away and their rebirths, their decline, their ascent, their going on the
path to happy existences, their going on the path to lower existences, their
having a beautiful color, and their having a bad color,
 exactly as they
were born.
1683
41. 83
“He saw the passing away and the rebirth of all those beings, and he saw
and knew their movements of mind, the conduct of their minds, the
continuation of their minds, their various thoughts, [F.197.b] their ocean of
faculties, the vast extent of their activities, the conclusion of their karma, and
the times for ripening and guiding them.
41. 84
“Noble one, when that prince passed away, he was reborn in the family of
that king in the royal capital, Rativyūhā, in that Jambudvīpa, and he
succeeded to the sovereignty of a cakravartin king. When he had become a

cakravartin king, following the parinirvāṇa of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata
Dharma cakra nirghoṣa gagana megha pradīpa rāja, he honored the Tathāgata
by the name of Dharma gaganābhyudgata śrī rāja.
41. 85
“After that, he became a Śakra who at the bodhimaṇḍa honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Devendragarbha.
“After that, in that world realm he became a Suyāma king of devas who
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Dharaṇī śrī parvata tejas.

“After that, in that world realm he became an asura lord who honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Sarva dharma nigarjita rāja.
41. 88
“After that, in that world realm he became a Brahmā lord [F.198.a] who
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Dharma cakra nirmāṇa samanta-

41. 89
“Noble one, there were those and the rest of the ten thousand buddhas
who appeared in that world realm of Ratnaprabhā during the Suprabha
kalpa. Prince Vijitāvin honored all those tathāgatas.
41. 90
“Noble one, following that Suprabha kalpa arose the kalpa
 called
Suraśmi. During that Suraśmi kalpa there were ten thousand buddhas.
1684
41. 91
“In that kalpa, I became Mahāmati. During the time when I was King
Mahāmati, I honored the Tathāgata by the name of Lakṣaṇa śrī parvata.
41. 92
“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a householder and I honored
the Tathāgata by the name of Saṃvṛtaskandha.
“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a minister and I honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Vimala vatsa.

“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a Vaiśravaṇa and I honored the
Tathāgata by the name of Devendracūḍa.

“Following that, in that same kalpa, I was a kumbhāṇḍa lord and I
honored the Tathāgata by the name of Avabhāsa makuṭin.
41. 97
“Noble one, in that way, I honored those ten tathāgatas and all the others.
I was reborn in various existences in the Suprabha kalpa and honored six
hundred million tathāgatas and made offerings to all those tathāgatas.
Whenever I came before each of those tathāgatas, I ripened realms of beings
without end or middle for the highest, complete enlightenment. Whenever I
came before each of those tathāgatas, I attained various entrances into
samādhis, various entrances into powers of mental retention, various ways
of accomplishments, various ways of accomplishing discernments, various
realizations of the ways of omniscience, various ways of attaining the
entrances to the illumination of the Dharma, various aspects of the analysis
that comprehends the ways of knowledge, various illuminations of entering
into the ocean of directions, and various illuminations of entering and
comprehending the various oceans of realms, and I attained various
illuminations of the perception that sees the ocean of tathāgatas. I overcame
them, purified them, perfected them, and remained in them. They were born,
they arose, they were increased, they were magnified, they arose perfectly,
and they arose completely.
41. 98
“Just as I attended the tathāgatas in that Suprabha kalpa, during kalpas as
numerous as the atoms in all the ocean of world realms, however many
tathāgatas appeared, however many tathāgatas came from other world
realms, [F.199.a] from all those tathāgatas who taught the Dharma, I heard
the Dharma that they taught, and having heard it, I possessed it. I honored
all those tathāgatas and served them. I held the teaching of all those buddha
bhagavats. I obtained from all those tathāgatas various ways for the
attainment of this bodhisattva liberation called the origin of the roots of merit that
inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the ripening of all beings, and I
obtained various entrances into ways of liberation.”
41. 99
Then at that time, the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya-
prabhā, in order to describe and teach this liberation, recited these verses to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
41. 100
“You, friend,
 have asked me about
1685
This inconceivable supreme liberation.
I shall teach it through the blessing of the Sugata.
Listen to me properly and entirely. {12}
41. 101
“There was the beautiful world realm
Ratnaprabhā in the past beyond
Inconceivable, vast, endless kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of buddha realms. {13}

41. 102
“In that time, there arose the kalpa Suprabha
In which countless jinas appeared.
I honored those lords of munis
And meditated on this liberation. {14}
41. 103
“There was a vast, excellent royal capital,
And its name was Rativyūhā.
At that time, the minds of beings were impure,
And they had dreadfully bad conduct. {15}
41. 104
“In that time, there was King Jayaprabha,
Who governed those beings according to the Dharma.1686
His son, named Vijitāvin, was handsome [F.199.b]
And adorned by the signs of a great being. {16}
41. 105
“At that time, seeing that the king was executing
Those many thousands of criminals,
The prince was filled with compassion and sadness,
And he quickly beseeched the king to release them. {17}
41. 106
“When the king had heard him, he gathered together
All his ministers and spoke to them.
They all bowed down to him and said to him,
‘This is a plan to assassinate you, Your Majesty!’ {18}
41. 107
“The king, having this misunderstanding,
At that time ordered the execution of his son.
The prince was indifferent to the loss of his own life,
And he did not free himself from being executed. {19}
41. 108
“When his mother heard that he was to be executed,
With her entourage she supplicated the king,
Asking for permission for the prince to give to the world
All that he possessed for the duration of half a month. {20}
41. 109
“The king gave his permission for that to be done,
And the prince gave away whatever was wanted
For half a month, day and night, practicing generosity.
And on the last day, to a gathering of Jains {21}
41. 110
“He gave whatever they desired,
And having given to them he prepared for death.
A multitude of beings wailing and weeping
Gathered together at the royal capital. {22}

41. 111
“At that time, there sat at the foot of a Bodhi tree
The Sugata Saddharma ghoṣāmbara dīpa rāja.
That lord of beings knew it was time to ripen them,
And with great compassion he came to the place where gifts were given. {23}
41. 112
“The Tathāgata came to that gathering
Through his miraculous powers,
And the Sugata taught the king of sūtras,
The sound of the Dharma as a cloud of lamps of the Dharma. {24}
41. 113
“He guided beings without end or middle
And at that time gave prophecies of enlightenment.
The son of the king, Vijitāvin, was overjoyed
And entered upon attaining the supreme enlightenment. {25}
41. 114
“He offered to the Sugata vast honors and offerings, [F.200.a]
And with joy he said these words:
‘May I become for beings a sanctuary, a guide,
A protector, a refuge, and a defender.’ {26}
41. 115
“He became a mendicant under that muni
And sought the path to enlightenment.
He examined the nature of phenomena,
Remaining practicing in that way for a hundred kalpas. {27}
41. 116
“He had compassion for beings with no protector
Who were falling into an ocean of suffering,
And, meditating on the path to true enlightenment,
He attained at that time this liberation. {28}
41. 117
“He joyfully honored every one
Of the sugatas who appeared in that kalpa,
Making great offerings to all of them
And possessing their wheels of the Dharma. {29}
41. 118
“After that, during an ocean of kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in a sea of realms,
He made offerings, and he honored
However many jinas appeared. {30}
41. 119
“I was the one named Vijitāvin,
Who saw the prisoners in the dreadful prison,
Offered up his body in order to free them,
And at that time attained this liberation, {31}

41. 120
“Who meditated during a great ocean of kalpas
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms,
And who, in each instant, multiplied the ways
That were unequaled and vast, without end or middle. {32}
41. 121
“I have obtained this liberation
From as many lords of munis as I saw;
They taught me this liberation
Through various ways of entry. {33}
41. 122
“I trained for many millions of kalpas
In this unmistaken, inconceivable liberation I received from them.
Established in it by the jinas, I was liberated.
I simultaneously drank from their clouds of Dharma. {34}
41. 123
“My bodies pervaded without impediment
All the realms in all the ten directions.
In each instant, I entered countless realms [F.200.b]
And entered the divisions of the three times. {35}
41. 124
“They gaze upon each and every one without exception
In the ocean of the jinas in the three times.
They wander in the presence of the clouds
Of the visual images of their bodies. {36}
41. 125
“They go in every direction,
Going into the presence of the jinas.
They send down a rain of every beautiful display,
And they offer it to those jinas. {37}
41. 126
“They ask an endless number of all questions
To the immense, vast ocean of buddhas.
And they possess all, without exception, of the rain
That falls from the clouds of the Dharma of the jinas. {38}
41. 127
“They go into every direction without exception,
Arriving in the presence of the fields of the jinas.
They manifest a variety of a multitude of forms,
And they manifest a variety of miracles. {39}
41. 128
“They fill all directions with thousands of forms
With their physical bodies that have infinite colors.
They can manifest from the form of a single body
Infinite aspects, vast without end or middle. {40}

41. 129
“They radiate an ocean of innumerable
Light rays from each and every pore,
And through a variety of methods they extinguish
The pain from the fire of the kleśas within beings. {41}
41. 130
“While they remain in one place, clouds of emanated bodies
Are radiated from each and every pore,
Filling all directions with marvelous wonders
And guiding beings with the rain of the water of the Dharma. {42}
41. 131
“This way of entering is that of inconceivable form.
It is the support for all the progeny of the jinas.
Remaining in this, they practice the conduct
Within all realms until the last of future kalpas. {43}
41. 132
“They teach the Dharma in accordance with aspirations,
And they repel the nets that are wrong views.
They establish beings in the higher existences and nirvāṇa,
And they teach the level of omniscience. {44}
41. 133
“They teach the Dharma according to aspirations
With endless colors and countless bodies, [F.201.a]
With all kinds of birth and worlds without exception,
With bodies that are the images of the bodies of all beings. {45}
41. 134
“These and also a measureless ocean of other qualities,
As numerous as the atoms in an ocean of realms
And beyond conception, are attained
By those who have this liberation, this peace. {46}
41. 135
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the origin of the roots
of merit that inspire, in accordance with their dispositions, the ripening of all beings.
How could I know the conduct, or comprehend the ocean of qualities, or
understand the prowess of the knowledge, or ascertain the states of mind, or
realize the power of samādhi, or know completely the miraculous
manifestation of the liberations of bodhisattvas who have transcended all
the existences in worlds, who appear in the visual form of all births in
worlds, who have transcended all worldly knowledge, who are dedicated to
destroying the mountain of all obscurations of knowledge, who have
discerned the nature and characteristics of all phenomena, who are
dedicated to eliminating all the obscurations and darkness of the kleśas, who
are skilled in the accomplishment of the analysis of all phenomena, who
have the direct perception of the Dharma of there being no self, who are
continuously ripening and guiding beings, who have realized the way of

nonduality of the realm of the Dharma, and who have the intelligence to
follow the ocean of all the ways within the scope of speech?1687
41. 136
“Depart, noble one. In the forest of Lumbinī in this Jambudvīpa, there is
the goddess of the Lumbinī Forest called Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī. Go to her
[F.201.b] and ask her, ‘How are bodhisattvas born into the family of the
tathāgatas? How do bodhisattvas appear in the world? How do they
unwearyingly practice bodhisattva conduct until the last of all future
kalpas?’ ”
41. 137
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the two feet of the
night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā, circumambulated
the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā many hundreds
of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, with palms together,
looking back at her, departed from the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā-

42. 1
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, remembering the instruction of the
night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā and meditating on,
comprehending, and augmenting the bodhisattva liberation called the origin
of the roots of merit that inspire the ripening of all beings, eventually arrived at the
Lumbinī Forest.
42. 2
He circumambulated the Lumbinī Forest, keeping it to his right, and then
searched for Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest goddess.
42. 3
He saw Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest goddess, in the Lumbinī
Forest inside a kūṭāgāra made by the encircling of all branches of trees made
of all precious materials. She was seated upon a precious lion throne with a
lotus in its center and accompanied by an assembly of two hundred
thousand trillion forest goddesses, seated before her and to whom she
taught the Dharma. [F.202.a] She was teaching them a sūtra called The
Teaching of the Ocean of Lifetimes of All Bodhisattvas. She was increasing the
power of the ocean of qualities of bodhisattvas who had been born into the
family of the tathāgatas.
42. 4
He approached the Lumbinī Forest goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, bowed
down to the feet of the Lumbinī Forest goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, and,
standing before her with palms together, said, “Āryā, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
bodhisattvas are born into the tathāgata family and how in practicing
bodhisattva conduct they bring light to beings.”
42. 5
The Lumbinī Forest goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī said, “Noble one, if the
bodhisattvas possess these ten kinds of birth, they are born into the family of
the tathāgatas. The bodhisattvas who originate from them in every instant of
mind increase the roots of merit of a bodhisattva, are unimpeded, are not
disheartened, do not regress, are not interrupted, are not dismayed, are not
discouraged, do not deteriorate, do not become confused, do not become

development of the bodhisattva’s aspiration for enlightenment, they
increase all the perfections, they turn away from all worldly existences, they

“Noble one, what is the first birth of a bodhisattva, called the essence of
dedication to the prayer to serve all buddhas? It is when the bodhisattva first
engages in serving and making offerings to the buddhas; venerating,

buddha bhagavats; never having enough of gazing upon the face of a
tathāgata; being dedicated to venerating the buddhas; having increasing

Then at that time, the Lumbinī Forest goddess Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, in
order to elucidate the meaning of this bodhisattva Dharma, through the
blessing of the Buddha gazed into the ten directions and then recited these
verses to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son:
42. 43
“Those who, with stainless, unalloyed higher motivation,
Never have enough of gazing upon the jinas,
The wise ones who pray for all-pervading clouds
Of displays for all the jinas, are in their first birth.

42. 44
“Those who pervade, without exception, all worlds, realms,
Beings,
 and also the Dharma and buddhas in the three times,

Whose minds are adorned by the prayer to liberate beings —
They are in their inconceivable second birth. {2}
42. 45
“Those who never have enough of drinking the clouds of the Dharma,
Who have unimpeded bodies in the three times, and minds with definitive
realization,
Who have mental bodies that are as stainless as the realm of space —
They are in this third birth that is unequaled. {3}
42. 46
“Those who with a higher motivation, like Sumeru, as firm
 as a vajra,
1715
Are entering the ocean of the ways of omniscience,
Who enter into the ocean of great compassion —
They, supreme among humans, are in their fourth birth. {4}

“They who pervade the ten directions
 with love, [F.208.a]

Who accomplish an ocean of stainless perfections,
Who radiate the light of the Dharma and ripen beings —
They are in the fifth birth of great beings. {5}

“They who having realized the nature of phenomena have unimpeded
minds,
Who are born into the family of the buddhas unequaled in the three times,
Who enter into the ocean of the ways of the realm of the Dharma —
They are in this sixth birth of those who have wisdom. {6}

“Those who have a completely pure Dharma body and an unimpeded mind,
Who with their own bodies pervade all realms without exception,
Who have gained the realization of all the strengths, without exception, of
the buddhas —

“Noble one, a bodhisattva is born into the family of the tathāgatas through
those ten births. In that way, the bodhisattva illuminates all worlds.
42. 54
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation [F.208.b] called the
miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of
countless kalpas.”
42. 55
Sudhana said, “Āryā, what is the scope of this bodhisattva liberation
called the miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the
perceptions of countless kalpas?”
She answered, “Noble one, I fulfilled the prayer to see and approach the
births of all bodhisattvas.

42. 56
“Noble one, I have comprehended the vast ocean of births of the Bhagavat
Vairocana. Thus, I have observed his births as bodhisattvas in this world
realm of a thousand million worlds. Because of my past prayer, I have been
born in the Lumbinī Forest of Jambudvīpa, one of the four continents, in
order to see the appearance of bodhisattvas. Now I am dwelling here,
remembering and meditating on the births of bodhisattvas. In that way, I
remain here. After I had been dwelling here for a hundred years, the
Bhagavat transmigrated from Tuṣita. At that time, there were ten omens that
appeared in the Lumbinī Forest. What were those ten? The first omen was
that in this Lumbinī Forest everywhere became level without ravines or cliffs
or high ground and low ground. The second omen was that throughout this
Lumbinī Forest the ground became made of diamond, was free of pebbles,
gravel, pieces of wood, and thorns, and was filled with many jewels. The
third omen was that this entire Lumbinī Forest became a place thick with
rows of precious trees, sal trees, and palm trees. The fourth omen was that
this entire Lumbinī Forest became a place in which grew aromatic seedlings
that were superior to divine matter, [F.209.a] in which appeared a treasure of
all powders, in which arose clouds and mists of all banners, and which was
adorned on every side by tree trunks formed of aromatic precious materials.
The fifth omen was that this entire Lumbinī Forest became a place where
there appeared, spreading everywhere, a treasury of
 various flowers,
garlands, and ornaments made of divine materials. The sixth omen was that
throughout this Lumbinī Forest all the trees became treasures of excellent
precious jewels. The seventh omen was that in all the lotus beds throughout
this Lumbinī Forest, all the flowers that grew from water blossomed, rose up
out of the ground, and floated above the water. The eighth omen was that all
the devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas,
lords of the world, and lords of beings in this world’s desire realms and form
realm gathered with their palms together in homage in this Lumbinī Forest.
The ninth omen was that all the female devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas,
asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas in this world realm of
Jambudvīpa
 gathered in this Lumbinī Forest joyfully, holding every kind
of offering in their hands, [F.209.b] gazing at the branches of the pippala tree,
bowing down, and paying homage. The tenth omen was that many light
rays called the lamps of the miraculous birth of the bodhisattva shone from the
circle of the navels on the bodies of all the tathāgatas in the ten directions,
and they illuminated and remained in this Lumbinī Forest. And all the
qualities of the bodhisattvas, including their miraculous births, were heard
emanating, with the sound of a buddha’s speech, from the circular tips of
those light rays.”

42. 57
“Those are the ten omens that appeared when the time came for the birth
of the bodhisattvas. When they appeared, all the lords of the world knew, ‘a
bodhisattva is going to be born.’
“Noble one, in that way they gained an inconceivably powerful joy on
seeing those ten omens.
42. 58
“Moreover, noble one, when Māyādevī came from the great city of
Kapilavastu, ten great illuminating omens appeared in this Lumbinī Forest.
When they appeared, they increased within countless beings the power of
joy in the light of the Dharma of omniscience.
42. 59
“What were those ten? (1) All of the precious kūṭāgāras upon the surface
of the earth shone. (2) All the classes of aromatic flowers shone.
 (3) Light
shone from all the petals of blossomed precious lotuses, and they emitted the
sweet-sounding words: ‘The excellent birth has come to be.’ [F.210.a] (4) The
illumination from all the first aspirations to enlightenment by bodhisattvas in
the ten directions appeared in and illuminated this Lumbinī Forest. (5) The
miraculous manifestation of illumination from the bodhisattvas ascending all
the bhūmis appeared in and illuminated this Lumbinī Forest. (6) All the
illumination from the light of the accomplishment of all the perfections and
the realization of knowledge by the bodhisattvas in the ten directions
appeared in and illuminated this Lumbinī Forest. (7) All the illumination
from the knowledge of the bodhisattvas in the ten directions that has power
over all prayers appeared in this Lumbinī Forest. (8) All the illumination from
the knowledge of the bodhisattvas in the ten directions that accomplishes
their vast prayers appeared in this Lumbinī Forest. (9) All the illumination
from the knowledge of the bodhisattvas in the ten directions that ripens and
guides beings appeared in this Lumbinī Forest. (10) All the illumination from
the knowledge of the bodhisattvas in the ten directions that comprehends
the miracles of all the buddhas, their setting forth, and their enlightenment at
buddhahood appeared in this Lumbinī Forest. Those ten great illuminating
omens appeared. [F.210.b] They illuminated the darkness of mind and
thoughts in a vast number of beings without end or middle.
1719
42. 60
“Noble one, when Māyādevī came to the pippala tree, all the gathered
assemblies of the lords of the world, the devas of the desire realms with
groups of apsarases and retinues of deva maidens, all the assembled devas
of the form realms, who were free of odors, and the gatherings of nāgas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, and their
retinues who were engaged in making offerings to the bodhisattvas had
their bodies and their assembled offerings illuminated by Māyādevī’s
brilliance, splendor, color, and form. All the lights that were in this world
realm of a thousand million worlds were outshone and eclipsed. No other
lights could affect, obscure, prevent, or impede the light and radiance that

was emitted from all Māyādevī’s pores. They filled all the directions and
ended all the suffering of beings in the hells, all the suffering of beings in
birth as an animal, all the suffering in the world of Yama, and all the
suffering and kleśas of all beings within the various states of existence, and
they remained illuminating, shining, and brilliant.
42. 61
“Noble one, that was the first miraculous manifestation at the birth of the
bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 62
“Moreover, noble one, at that time, there appeared situated within
Māyādevī’s body
 the visual images of this world realm of a thousand
million worlds. [F.211.a] Within that world realm of a thousand million
worlds, in all the Jambudvīpas in its thousand million four-continent worlds,
in kingdoms with various names, in forests with various names, Māyādevī
went to the foot of various kinds of trees, where she was encircled by all the
lords of the worlds, waiting in preparation for the birth of the bodhisattva.
This was through the inconceivable miraculous manifestation of the wisdom
of the bodhisattva’s mother.
1720
42. 63
“Noble one, that was the second miraculous manifestation at the birth of
the bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.
42. 64
“Moreover, noble one, there appeared within each opening of all
Māyādevī’s pores all the tathāgatas that in the past were honored,
worshiped, venerated, and offered to by the Bhagavat during his practice of
bodhisattva conduct. All the Dharma that those tathāgatas were teaching
could be heard sounding from each pore with the aspects of a buddha’s
speech. It was like how the reflection of the display in the domain of the sky
of the sun, moon, planets, and stars, and of clouds emitting the deep sound
of thunder, appear in a small bowl of water, or a particle of gold, or the bright
surface of a mirror, or on very clear water.
42. 65
“Noble one, in that way, the miraculous manifestations of the past
tathāgatas appeared and the sound of all their Dharma teachings sounded
within the openings of all Māyādevī’s pores.
42. 66
“Noble one, that was the third miraculous manifestation at the birth of the
bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest. [F.211.b]
42. 67
“Moreover, noble one, from Māyādevī’s entire body and from each
opening of all her pores appeared all the realms, the entire ocean of world
realms, the entire vast extent of world realms, the entire multitude of world
realms, and all that are called world realms in which the Bhagavat practiced
bodhisattva conduct in the past. There appeared the surface of the realms;
their shapes; their arrangement; their bulks; their adorning mountains; their
adorning villages, towns, regions, lands, and cities; their adorning parks,
rivers,
 lakes, ponds, and seas; their adorning skies and clouds; their
abodes of beings; the yānas that were taught there; the numbers and names

of their kalpas; their births of buddhas; their perfect purities; the lifespans of
beings; their rebirths into worlds; the communities of beings; the
dependence on kalyāṇamitras; the dedication to virtuous qualities; the
engagement in the practice of the Dharma; and the practice of bodhisattva
conduct in buddha realms. In all the pores there appeared all the Bhagavat’s
attainment of the state of irreversibility, his previous bodies, [F.212.a] his
conduct, his appearance, what possessions he had, what happiness and
unhappiness he experienced, and his lifespans. There appeared in all the
pores of Māyādevī’s body images of the various births in all those buddha
realms, Māyādevī as the mothers of the bodhisattvas, and all those bodies of
the bodhisattvas.
42. 68
“Noble one, that was the fourth miraculous manifestation at the birth of
the bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.

“Moreover, noble one, there appeared in all the pores of Māyādevī’s body
images of the past bodies in which the Bhagavat practiced bodhisattva
conduct, their colors, their shapes, their appearances, their forms, their
possessions, their happiness and sufferings, and their lifespans.

bodhisattva that appeared in the Lumbinī Forest.

“Moreover, noble one, there appeared in all the pores of Māyādevī’s body
images of when the Bhagavat was practicing bodhisattva conduct in the past
and gave away that which was difficult to give. He gave away his legs and
arms. He gave away his ears and nose. He gave away his tongue and teeth.
He gave away his eyes and head. He gave away his flesh and blood. He
gave away his bones and marrow. He gave away his kidneys and heart.
[F.212.b] He gave away his skin and subcutaneous tissue. He gave away all
his outer and inner things. He gave away his sons, daughters, and wives. He
gave away his body. He gave away his precious possessions. He gave away
his villages and towns. He gave away his regions and realms. He gave away
his royal capital. He gave away his wealth, grain, treasures, and storehouses.
He gave away his jewels, pearls, beryls, conches, crystals, corals, gold, and
silver. He gave away his various precious adornments. He gave away his
beds and seats. He gave away his houses and palaces. He gave away all his
possessions. There appeared the physical forms of the bodhisattva and the
way in which he gave, the appearance of those who acquired what he gave
away, the appearance of the things that he gave away, the places where he
gave them away, and all who were at that time in the entourage of the
bodhisattva.

the past to be born from their mother’s body, there appeared all the arrays
and adornments of buddha realms; the arrays of adorning beings; the arrays
of adorning trees; the arrays of flowers, perfumes, incenses, garlands,
ointments, powders, clothing, banners, and flags; [F.213.a] the various
miraculous manifestations of arrays of all precious jewels; and music, song,
praises, and the sound of musical instruments. When Māyādevī came to the
Lumbinī Forest, all of those arose, appeared, and were perceived by beings
in the Lumbinī Forest.

Vairocana, the same adornment of the signs and features of a great being,
the same aura, the same radiating of light rays, the same way of moving, the

 comprised the king

 All kings of jewels adorned the

melodious songs that had honored the buddhas of the past. All the lords of
asuras, forsaking all pride, arrogance, and haughtiness, bowed down and

“Just as I see and comprehend all the miraculous manifestations at the
birth of bodhisattvas in this world realm, in the same way, in each instant of
mind, with the penetration of the mind, through continuous spiritual power,
I see and comprehend all the miraculous manifestations at the births of
bodhisattvas in all the vast extent of world realms, without end or middle, in
the ten directions and in all atoms.”
42. 91
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, asked Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the
Lumbinī Forest goddess, “Āryā, how long has it been since you attained this
bodhisattva liberation called the miraculous manifestations at the birth of
bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of countless kalpas?”
42. 92
She answered, “Noble one, in the past, in times gone by, beyond as many
kalpas as there are atoms in ten million buddha realms, and even further
beyond, there was a world realm called Samanta ratnā in a kalpa called
Samāpadyata in which appeared eighty quintillion buddhas. There appeared
in that world the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Īśvara guṇāparājita-
dhvaja, who was one with wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who
knows the world’s beings, an unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a
teacher of devas and humans, [F.215.b] a buddha, and a bhagavat.
1733
42. 93
“Noble one, at the center of the world realm called Samanta ratnā, there
was a four-continent world called Vicitra vyūha prabhā. In the middle of the
Jambudvīpa of that four-continent world there was a royal capital called


---

Meru viśuddha vyūha dhvajā. In that royal capital there was King Ratnārci-
netra prabha. King Ratnārci netra prabha had a queen called Suharṣita-
prabheśvarā.
42. 94
“Noble one, just as Māyādevī became the mother of the Bhagavat
Vairocana in this four-continent world, at that time, in that time, Queen
Suharṣita prabheśvarā became the mother of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata
Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja, in the four-continent world called Vicitra vyūha-
prabhā. He was the first of the eighty quintillion buddhas. She was the
mother of the first bhagavat to appear, the Tathāgata Īśvara guṇāparājita-
dhvaja.
42. 95
“Noble one, when the time had come for the birth of the bodhisattva,
Queen
 Suharṣita prabheśvarā, together with two hundred thousand
trillion women, went to the great park called Suvarṇa puṣpābha maṇḍala.
Prince Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja was born there with the inconceivable
miraculous manifestations that occur at the birth of a bodhisattva.
1734
42. 96
“At that time, there appeared in the center of the great park called
Suvarṇa puṣpābha maṇḍala a kūṭāgāra called Subha ratna vicitra kūṭa. [F.216.a]
The Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja was born from
Queen Suharṣita prabheśvarā as she held on to a branch of a wish-fulfilling
tree inside that kūṭāgāra.
42. 97
“At that time, when the Bhagavat was born, the nurse Vimala saṃbhava-
prabhā was in attendance. As soon as the bodhisattva was born, the lords of
the world sprinkled him with a vase of scented water that was wonderfully
aromatic and with a variety of beautiful flowers so as to cool his body. They
made countless inconceivable, supreme appropriate offerings to him and
placed him on the nurse Vimala saṃbhava prabhā’s lap. The instant that she
took the bodhisattva onto her lap, the nurse attained great powerful joy and
faith and attained the bodhisattva samādhi called all-seeing. As soon as she
attained that, she saw the countless tathāgatas present within the world
realms in the ten directions. She entered in a subtle way this bodhisattva
liberation called the miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas
throughout all the perceptions of countless kalpas. This was like the moment when
a consciousness enters a womb. Through attaining that liberation, she made
the great prayer to see the miraculous manifestations at the births of all
tathāgatas.
42. 98
“Noble one, what do you think? [F.216.b] If you think that the
bodhisattva’s nurse, Vimala saṃbhava prabhā, at that time, in that time, was
anyone else, do not see her in that way. I was at that time, in that time, the
bodhisattva’s nurse, Vimala saṃbhava prabhā.


---

42. 99
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that the two hundred
thousand trillion women at that time, in that time, were anyone else, do not
see them in that way. They are these two hundred thousand trillion
goddesses who now dwell in the Lumbinī Forest and are my entourage.
42. 100
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that Queen Suharṣita-
prabheśvarā, the mother of the Tathāgata Īśvara guṇāparājita dhvaja, at that
time, in that time, was anyone else, do not see her in that way. This
Māyādevī was at that time, in that time, the queen named Suharṣita-
prabheśvarā.
42. 101
“Noble one, what do you think? If you think that King Ratnārci netra-
prabha at that time, in that time, was anyone else, do not see him in that way.
King Śuddhodana was at that time, in that time, the king named Ratnārci-
netra prabha.
42. 102
“Noble one, since that time, in every instant I have never been apart from
seeing and comprehending the ocean of miraculous manifestations at the
bodhisattva births of the Bhagavat Vairocana or from seeing and
comprehending the ocean of the miraculous manifestations of his supremacy
in guiding beings.
42. 103
“Noble one, in every moment of mind, with eyes of knowledge that
encompass all atoms, I see and comprehend within all atoms in this world
realm of Sahā an ocean of the buddha realms of the tathāgatas, which have
appeared from the vast extent of the ocean of prayers made by the Bhagavat
Vairocana. [F.217.a] I see and comprehend the ocean of the tathāgatas that
are in those buddha realms. I also see and comprehend the great ocean of
the miraculous manifestations at the bodhisattva births of those tathāgatas.
42. 104
“In the same way, in every instant of mind I see and comprehend the
entire ocean of the miraculous manifestations of the supremacy of guiding
beings and the ocean of the miraculous manifestations at the bodhisattva
births of all tathāgatas in the ten directions.
42. 105
“I 
perceive 
without 
error 
the 
births 
of 
bodhisattvas 
through
comprehending the succession of the entire vast extent of atoms in this
world realm of a thousand million worlds, and I comprehend the qualities of
the buddhas. In the same way, I comprehend the entire ocean of realms
contained within the entire vast extent of the atoms in countless tens of
thousands of quintillions of buddha realms in the ten directions, and I
comprehend the vast ocean of buddhas within them. I also see the
perception of the miraculous manifestations at the bodhisattva births of
those buddha bhagavats. I make offerings to them when they become
tathāgatas. I hear the teachings that those tathāgatas give. I practice the
correct Dharma of their Dharma.”


---

42. 106
Then at that time, Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the goddess of the Lumbinī Forest,
[F.217.b] in order to teach clearly the bodhisattva liberation called the
miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of
countless kalpas, through the blessing of the Buddha, gazed into the ten
directions and recited these verses:
42. 107
“Son of the jinas,
 you have shown respect
1735
And have asked a question, so listen to what I have to say.
The field of activity of the jinas is a peace that is hard to see
And which is manifested through the ways of causes and conditions. {1}
42. 108
“I remember as many countless kalpas ago
As there are atoms in ten million realms,
There was a kalpa that had the name Samāpadyata,1736
In which there were eight hundred million
 jinas. {2}
1737
42. 109
“The first of the kalpa’s tathāgatas to appear
Was Īśvarājita guṇa dhvaja.
I saw the birth of that lord of beings
In the supreme forest Svarṇa puṣpa prabhava. {3}
42. 110
“I was his wise nurse,
Vimala saṃbhava prabhā.
As soon as he was born, there was a supreme golden light,
And the lords of the world placed him on my lap. {4}
42. 111
“When the supreme individual was placed on my lap,
I could not see the top of his inconceivable head.
Though I looked from the right and the left,
I was not able to see where it ended. {5}
42. 112
“He was adorned with the excellent physical signs,
And his body was stainless and beautiful.
He was as if made of jewels, and when I saw him
An unparalleled powerful joy increased within me. {6}
42. 113
“As I contemplated his measureless qualities,
The ocean of my merit increased.
When I saw the ocean of his miraculous manifestations,
A vast aspiration for enlightenment arose within me. {7}
42. 114
“With joy and faith in the Jina’s ocean of excellences, [F.218.a]
I gave rise to an ocean of prayers.
The vast extent of all realms was purified,


---

And all paths to lower existences were averted. {8}
42. 115
“I made an ocean of prayers that I would make
Countless offerings to future sugatas
Throughout the vast extent of realms
And liberate beings from suffering. {9}
42. 116
“I heard the Dharma from that lord
And attained the field of this liberation.
For kalpas as numerous as atoms in ten million realms,
I practiced and purified bodhisattva conduct. {10}
42. 117
“I have made offerings to however many lords
Have appeared without exception.
I became a holder of their teachings,
And I purified the ocean of this liberation. {11}
42. 118
“I became a holder of the Dharma wheel
Of all the past possessors of the ten strengths,
As numerous as the atoms in ten million realms,
And I have meditated on the field of this liberation. {12}
42. 119
“I see all the vast extent of the surfaces of atoms,
As many atoms as there are in the buddha realms.
In each atom I see the ocean of realms
That have been purified in the past by the jinas. {13}
42. 120
“In all that vast extent of realms,
The lords from their one mind
Manifest countless miracles,
And I see their births in supreme forests. {14}
42. 121
“There are certain jinas in certain realms
Intending to attain supreme enlightenment,
Who though they are residing in the world of Tuṣita
Manifest within an ocean of realms. {15}
42. 122
“In countless tens of millions of realms,
I see this vast extent of their births.
I see the lords teaching the Dharma
While in the center of an assembly of youths. {16} [F.218.b]
42. 123
“I see in each instant of mind those heroes
Who are as numerous as the atoms in ten million realms
Leaving home and going to the foot of the king of trees


---

And manifesting the vast field of activity of a buddha.
 {17}
1738
42. 124
“They manifest inconceivable numbers of this and that realm,
Which are as numerous as the atoms in a realm.
I see the supreme humans attaining buddhahood
And liberating beings in various existences from suffering.1739
42. 125
“They turn the unceasing, self-originated,
Supreme wheel of the surface of each atom.
Their voices have an unceasing ocean of speech.
I see them sending down rain from clouds of Dharma.1740
42. 126
“In each instant they manifest passing into nirvāṇa
In many different forms for all beings.
I see, in
 a single atom of a realm, buddhas
1741
As numerous as the atoms in ten million realms.1742
42. 127
“Looking at one atom, I see an ocean of realms
And all the jinas who appear in them.
In many hundred billion
 bodies in my lifetimes,
1743
I have gone to make offerings to them. {18}
42. 128
“There are all the endless existences of beings
In the inconceivable ways of the ocean of realms.
I come before them all and send down
A rain from the vast clouds of the Dharma. {19}
42. 129
“Son of the jinas, I know this inconceivable
Supreme field of liberation,
But I could not teach it all
In countless quintillions of kalpas. {20}
42. 130
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the miraculous
manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of countless
kalpas. How could I describe the qualities or know the conduct of
bodhisattvas who in each instant of mind have the motivation to appear in
all kalpas from the wombs they have entered; who manifest births that have
the definitive understanding of all the ways of the Dharma; [F.219.a] who
have the aspiration that gives rise to prayers to make offerings to all the
tathāgatas; who are dedicated to attaining the complete realization of all the
Dharma of the buddhas; who manifest like reflections within the classes and
existences of all beings; who are born from lotuses at the feet of all the
tathāgatas; who are skilled in knowing when the time has come to ripen all
beings; who manifest the miracle of taking rebirth with the intention to


---

guide all beings; who manifest clouds of miracles throughout the entire vast
extent of realms; and who appear as reflections in all the classes of births and
existences of all beings?
42. 131
“Depart, noble one. In the great city of Kapilavastu there is the Śākya
maiden called Gopā. Go to her and ask her, ‘How should a bodhisattva
continue in saṃsāra in order to ripen beings?’ ”
42. 132
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the two feet of
Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest goddess, circumambulated
Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest goddess, many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, with palms together,
looking back at her, departed from Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī, the Lumbinī Forest
goddess. [B14]

Chapter 43
GOPĀ
43. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, left the presence of Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī,
the Lumbinī Forest goddess, and went to the location of the great city of
Kapilavastu. [F.219.b]
43. 2
While meditating on, comprehending, increasing, practicing, purifying,
contemplating, and examining the bodhisattva liberation called the miraculous
manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of countless
kalpas, he came to the assembly hall of the bodhisattvas called the
Illuminating Light of the Realm of the Dharma.
1744
43. 3
When he arrived there, he was greeted by Aśokaśrī, the goddess of the
assembly hall of the bodhisattvas, together with ten thousand house
goddesses.
43. 4
She said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “We welcome you, great
being who has the prowess of great wisdom and knowledge; whose mind
has attained the meditation of inconceivable bodhisattva liberation; whose
field of activity is the vast divine palace of the Dharma; who enters the city of
the Dharma; who is continuously engaged in guiding beings through
infinite bodhisattva methods; who has attained the illumination of the ocean
of qualities of the tathāgatas; who has the manifest knowledge and
illuminating eloquence for guiding all beings; who has the motivation to
manifest the conduct of
 a corresponding body and language
 that
knows the conduct of all beings; who prays to increase the power of an
ocean of joy in the minds of all beings; and who follows the path to the
comprehension of the Dharma of all the tathāgatas.
1745
1746
43. 5
“I see that you have the field of activity of profound behavior with a
steady
 gaze, [F.220.a] and that therefore you are someone who will soon
attain the unsurpassable pure adornments of the body, speech, and mind of
1747


---

the tathāgatas and will act in this world with a body adorned by the signs
and features of a great being and with a mind adorned by the light of
knowledge of the ten strengths.
43. 6
“I see that you have diligence and prowess, and that therefore you are
someone who soon will have the vision of the tathāgatas of the three times;
will hold the clouds of Dharmas of all the tathāgatas; will experience the joy
of the divine palace of the four qualities of bodhisattva dhyānas, liberations,
samādhis, and samāpattis; and will enter the profound liberation of the
buddhas.
43. 7
“In that way, you go before kalyāṇamitras, gaze upon them, honor them,
receive their teaching without error, and are dedicated to the practice of its
qualities that is unwearied, irreversible, and never disheartened. You are
unaffected by any hindrance, obstacle, or obscuration whatsoever. Neither
Māra nor the māra class of deities are present before you, and therefore you
will soon bring happiness to all beings.”
43. 8
The head merchant’s son, Sudhana, said to Aśokaśrī, the goddess of the
assembly hall of the bodhisattvas, “Goddess, I gain the highest delight in
ending the torment of the kleśas for all beings. I gain the highest delight in
repelling dreadful
 karma for all beings, [F.220.b] in bringing happiness to
all beings, and in making all beings practice faultless actions. Bodhisattvas
become very unhappy when beings engage in the unhappiness of various
kinds of karma and kleśas, which disturbs their minds and causes them to
fall into the lower existences. Even if those beings remain in happier
existences, they experience physical and mental sufferings and various
kinds of unhappiness and remain in a state of sorrow.
1748
43. 9
“Goddess, it is like if a very loving father who has a beloved, beautiful son
sees the limbs and smaller parts of his son’s body being cut off. Because he is
so loving, he becomes extremely unhappy and sorrowful.
43. 10
“Goddess, in the same way, when a bodhisattva who is engaged in
bodhisattva conduct sees beings falling into the three lower existences
through the power of their karma and kleśas, the bodhisattva becomes
extremely unhappy and sorrowful.
43. 11
“The bodhisattvas are happy, glad, joyful, delighted, and pleased when
beings are reborn into happy existences when their bodies are destroyed, or
when they experience physical and mental happiness in a divine or human
existence as the result of their having adopted good physical, vocal, and
mental conduct.
43. 12
“Goddess, the bodhisattvas do not aspire to and are not dedicated to
omniscience for their own sake or in order to experience the various joys and
pleasures of saṃsāra. [F.221.a] It is not from dedication to the various
different kinds of joys within the desire realm. It is not through the power of


---

mistaken perception, motivation, or views. It is not through the power of
involvement, bondage, predispositions, or being overwhelmed. It is not
through the power of the view of craving. It is not through the increase of a
mind that conceives of the joys of crowds and the gatherings of various
beings. It is not through attachment to the experiences of the joy and bliss of
dhyāna. It is not going around and around in the continuity of saṃsāra
while being obscured by various obscurations.
43. 13
“Goddess, the bodhisattvas have great compassion for beings who are in
the ocean of saṃsāra and who are tormented by immeasurable sufferings.
They make great prayers to gather to themselves all beings. Through the
power of having made those prayers with great compassion, they are
dedicated to ripening and guiding beings, and they appear carrying out
bodhisattva conduct in saṃsāra. In order to eliminate all the obscurations of
beings, they seek the unobscured wisdom of omniscience and make prayers
to serve and make offerings to all the tathāgatas. Through the power of their
prayers to serve and make offerings to all the tathāgatas, they are never
disheartened in their practice of bodhisattva conduct. When they are
practicing bodhisattva conduct and see a realm that is completely defiled,
they make the prayer to purify all buddha realms. When they are purifying
defiled realms [F.221.b] and see the various āyatanas of all beings, they make
the prayer to purify the Dharma body that is undifferentiated and
unsurpassable. When they see the defiled bodies, speech, and minds of
beings, they make the prayer to purify the bodies, speech, and minds that
adorn all beings. When they see the incomplete āyatanas and impure minds
of beings, they purify the minds and conduct of all beings and are never
disheartened in carrying out bodhisattva conduct.
43. 14
“Goddess, in that way, with minds that are never disheartened, the
bodhisattvas carry out vast bodhisattva conduct without end or middle. With
that kind of conduct they are adornments of the world because they create
the good fortune of devas and humans. They are like parents because they
establish beings in the aspiration for enlightenment. They are like nurses
because they bring beings onto the bodhisattva path. They are like connate
deities, who are deities that always accompany a being because they protect
beings from the terror of the abyss of the lower existences. They are like
great ferrymen because they free beings from the ocean of saṃsāra. They are
refuges because they repel all the terrors of the māras and kleśas. They are
shelters because they bring beings to a state of complete tranquility.
 They
are bathing places because they bring beings into the ocean of all buddhas.
They are protectors because they escort beings to the island of the jewels of
the Dharma. They are flowers because their minds have blossomed with all
the qualities of buddhahood. They are adornments because they radiate the
1749


---

light of merit and wisdom. [F.222.a] They bring the highest delight and
happiness because they are beautiful. They are excellent to meet because
they are dedicated to faultless actions. They are completely good because
they possess bodies that are complete in having all aspects of excellent
limbs. They have charming forms because the sight of them is without
anything disagreeable. They bring light because they radiate the light rays of
wisdom. They bring illumination because they hold the torch of the Dharma.
They bring clarity because they purify the motivation for enlightenment.
They are generals because they repel the activities of the māras. They are
suns because they radiate a net of the light rays of wisdom. They are moons
because they rise as moons of realization in the sky of the Dharma.
 They
are clouds because they send down rain from great clouds of Dharma onto
all beings.
1750
“Goddess, the bodhisattvas who practice in that way are a delight for all
beings.”
43. 15
Then Aśokaśrī, the goddess of the assembly hall of the bodhisattvas,
together with ten thousand goddesses of the home, sent down onto
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, a rain of flowers, garlands, incense,
powders, ointments, and precious jewelry that transcended divine materials.
Encircling him and following him as he entered the assembly hall of the
bodhisattvas, they praised him with these verses:
43. 16
“Having developed the aspiration for enlightenment
Out of love for all beings,
The jinas, the suns of wisdom,
Sometimes appear in the world. {1}
43. 17
“Even in many millions
 of kalpas [F.222.b]
1751
It is difficult to see your face.
Your wisdom is a great sun
In the world blinded by ignorance. {2}
43. 18
“Great compassion arose in you
When you saw the world in error,
Obscured by the darkness of unknowing,
And you spontaneously appeared in it and remained. {3}
43. 19
“With your pure motivation, you are dedicated
To attaining the enlightenment of buddhahood.
You serve and depend on kalyāṇamitras
Without regard for your own body and life. {4}
43. 20
“You have no reliance on this world.


---

You have no location and no preoccupations.
You have no entanglements and no abode.
Your motivation is like space, without impediment. {5}
43. 21
“As you practice bodhisattva conduct
With the brilliant light of a field of merit,
Your radiant torch of wisdom
Shines within countless worlds. {6}
43. 22
“You are not above the world,
But you are unstained by worldly qualities.
You act in the world without impediment,
Like the breezes moving through the sky. {7}
43. 23
“You are dedicated to constantly blazing
Like the burning at the kalpa’s end.
You practice the bodhisattva conduct
With the ardor of the fire that ends a kalpa. {8}
43. 24
“You have great courage, like a lion.
With strong, diligent prowess
You have attained the prowess of wisdom
With a practice that is invincible. {9}
43. 25
“Through honoring the kalyāṇamitras,
You, here, have entered into
The ocean of all the different ways
Within the ocean of the realm of the Dharma.” {10}
43. 26
In that way, Aśokaśrī, the goddess of the assembly hall of the bodhisattvas,
praised in verse Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, while following him out
of a yearning for the Dharma.
43. 27
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went into the assembly hall of the
bodhisattvas called the Illuminating Light of the Realm of the Dharma.
[F.223.a] When he had entered, wishing to find the Śākya maiden Gopā, he
looked everywhere.
43. 28
He saw the Śākya maiden Gopā in the center of the assembly hall of the
bodhisattvas called the Illuminating Light of the Realm of the Dharma. She
was seated upon a precious throne that had in its center a lotus with a form
that illuminated all the abodes of bodhisattvas, and she was encircled by an
entourage of eighty-four thousand women of royal families, who all had
equally the roots of merit from the past practice of bodhisattva conduct; who
in the past had attracted gatherings of beings through acts of generosity;
who had a way of speaking with pleasant and gentle words; who cared for


---

beings through causing them to focus on the goal of omniscience; who cared
for beings in accord with the realizations of the buddhas and the
bodhisattvas; who with all actions inspired by great compassion cared for
beings as if they were their sons and daughters; who with great love
followed and purified their spouses; and who in the past ripened beings
through the inconceivable skillful methods of bodhisattvas.
43. 29
Those eighty-four thousand women followed the way of the perfections of
bodhisattvas who were progressing irreversibly toward the highest,
complete enlightenment. They followed the bodhisattva training without
expectation of reward from others. They had minds free from all attachment.
They were disillusioned by all the delights of saṃsāra. They had purified
without impediment all the ways in the realm of the Dharma. They had the
power of the motivation directed toward omniscience. They were free from
the net of obscurations and obstacles. [F.223.b] They had transcended all the
paths of attachment. They were active through emanations of their Dharma
bodies. They were focused on ripening and guiding all worlds. They had
minds in which a stainless ocean of merit had arisen. They had become what
they were because of their completely good bodhisattva prayers and
conduct. They had increased the vast power of the strengths of bodhisattvas.
And their minds had become illuminating like the disk of the sun.
43. 30
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the Śākya
maiden and then stood before her, his hands placed together in homage, and
said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas continue within
saṃsāra without being stained by saṃsāra; how they realize the equal
nature of all phenomena but do not dwell on the level of the śrāvakas and
pratyeka buddhas; how they attain the illumination of the Dharma of the
buddhas and yet continue with their bodhisattva conduct; how they dwell
on the level of a bodhisattva but teach the scope of knowledge of the
tathāgatas; how they transcend all worldly existences but are active within
all worldly existences; how they accomplish a body of the Dharma but also
accomplish form bodies of infinite colors; how they attain the Dharma body
that has no characteristics but manifest bodies with the colors and shapes of
all beings; and how they realize that all Dharmas cannot be described but
teach the Dharma to all beings, describing them with all ways of speaking
and definitions. [F.224.a] They know that all beings
 are without existence,
but they do not turn away from the ways of guiding the realm of beings; they
comprehend that all phenomena are unborn and unceasing, but they do not
abandon engaging in making offerings to and venerating all the tathāgatas;
and they realize that there is no karma and ripening within all phenomena,
but they do not turn away from engagement in accomplishing good actions.”
1752

43. 31
Gopā, the Śākya maiden, said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
“Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you intended to ask in that way
about the nature of bodhisattva conduct. Those questions are also the words
of the completely good prayer and conduct.
“Therefore, noble one, listen carefully and remember, for I shall teach
through the blessing of the Buddha.
43. 32
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who have ten qualities such as these fulfill
the bodhisattva conduct that is like the appearance of magical illusions and
gives rise to the light of wisdom.
43. 33
“What are these ten? They are (1) reliance on sublime kalyāṇamitras, (2)
the attainment of a vast aspiration, (3) a pure, sublime virtuous motivation,
(4) a mind supported by a vast ocean of merit and wisdom, (5) being able to

bodhisattva conduct, (8) the attainment of the blessing of all the tathāgatas,
(9) the natural, pure, higher motivation of great compassion, and (10) that

“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who have those ten qualities fulfill the
bodhisattva conduct that is like the appearance of magical illusions and
gives rise to the light of wisdom.1753
43. 34
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas with nonregressing diligence who have
obtained those ten qualities, in order to accomplish an inexhaustible way
and practice an extremely vast meditation, serve the kalyāṇamitras and
please them in ten ways.
43. 35
“What are those ten ways? They are (1) having no concern for one’s own
life and body, (2) having no interest in the requisites of saṃsāra, (3) having
the comprehension of the equality of all phenomena, (4) having an
irrevocable prayer for omniscience, (5) observing all the ways of the realm of

unobscured field of the knowledge of a bodhisattva.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who have those ten qualities serve and
please the kalyāṇamitras.” [F.225.a]
43. 36
Then the Śākya maiden Gopā, in order to teach the meaning of that,
through the blessing of the buddhas looked into the ten directions and
recited these verses:
43. 37
“Those sublime, stainless, wise ones engaged in benefiting others,


---

Dedicated without deceit or deception to serving excellent friends,
Recognizing them as teachers and having unflagging diligence —
They carry out in the world this conduct that is like a magical apparition. {11}
43. 38
“There are those who have sublime motivation as vast as space
Within whom is contained the worlds of the three times,
Realms, beings, phenomena, and likewise the buddhas.
This is the conduct of those who shine with wisdom. {12}
43. 39
“There are those whose motivation is like space, without end or middle,
Who are completely pure, unstained by the kleśas,
And who give rise to the qualities of all the tathāgatas.
Their conduct is like the appearance of magical apparitions. {13}
43. 40
“There are those who have clear minds and an ocean of qualities
And are established in vast, limitless, inconceivable, omniscient wisdom.
They have bodies that have an ocean of merit and a pure essence
That is unstained by worldly impurities even though they act within the
world. {14}
43. 41
“There are those who never have enough of listening to the thunder of the
Dharma
That has the aspects of the speech of the jinas and all the ways of languages
And who are lamps of the light of wisdom, which follow the way of the
Dharma.
This is the conduct of those who bring illumination to beings. {15}
43. 42
“There are those who comprehend in each instant of the mind
Each one of the countless tathāgatas in the ten directions,
And they see and know the entire ocean of sugatas.
This is the conduct of those who keep the buddhas in mind. {16}
43. 43
“There are those who see the vast assemblies of followers of the jinas
And who comprehend the ocean of their ways of samādhi
And the ways of their vast ocean of prayers with no end or middle. [F.225.b]
This conduct of theirs is like the appearance of illusions. {17}
43. 44
“There are those who have been blessed by every jina in the ten directions,
Who have the completely good conduct till the final kalpa,
And whose images appear throughout the vast extent of the realms.
This is the conduct of those who bring the light of the Dharma. {18}
43. 45
“There are those who have the disk of the sun of compassion,
Who, seeing beings in distress, illuminate them with the Dharma’s light,


---

Clear away the darkness of beings, and cause the teachings to shine.
This is the conduct of those who are like the sun. {19}
43. 46
“There are those who see beings circling through existences,
And those clear-minded ones remain, countering saṃsāra’s flow,
And everywhere they bring about the wheel of the Dharma.
They are practicing the wise, supreme, completely good conduct. {20}
43. 47
“There are those who, training in this, manifest to beings,
In accord with aspirations, bodies without limit or middle,
Their countless bodies being like reflections or mirages,
And they ripen many beings within the ocean of existences. {21}
43. 48
“There are those who are spreading among beings through the vast ways of
love,
Manifesting conducts to beings with various dispositions,
And sending down a rain of Dharma in accordance with the aspirations of
beings.
Those resolute ones guide billions of beings toward enlightenment.” {22}
43. 49
Those are the verses that Gopā, the Śākya maiden, recited. She then said to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, I have attained the
bodhisattva liberation called the range of the view of all the ways of the ocean of the
samādhis of the bodhisattvas.”
43. 50
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is this bodhisattva liberation called the range of
the view of all the ways of the ocean of the samādhis of the bodhisattvas like?”
Gopā answered, “Noble one, when I rest within this bodhisattva
liberation, [F.226.a] I see and comprehend as many kalpas in this world realm
as there are atoms in countless buddha realms. I know all the existences of
beings who are within that kalpa. I also know all the gateways into death
