Chapter 27
SIṂHA VIJṚMBHITĀ
27. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, set out for the town of Kaliṅgavana in
the land of Śroṇāparānta and then arrived there. Searching for the bhikṣuṇī
Siṃha vijṛmbhitā, as he roamed here and there he questioned the people he
met. There were many hundreds of young men
 and many hundreds of
young women assembling and following in the streets, crossroads, and
street junctions, together with many hundreds of men and many hundreds
of women.
1154
27. 2
They said, “Noble one, the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā is in this town of
Kaliṅgavana, sitting in the great park called Sūrya prabha donated by
Jayaprabha, where she is teaching the Dharma for the sake of countless
beings.”
27. 3
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went to Sūrya prabha Park.
Walking around it and looking about, he saw in the park many trees called
candrodgata that had the shape of kūṭāgāras, had various colors of light, and
shone with light, illuminating everywhere around up to a yojana. He saw
many leafy trees called saṃpracchada that had the shape of a parasol, and
their leaves covered everywhere, like shining clouds the color of blue beryl.
He saw many blossoming trees called kusuma kośa that had the varied
beautiful shape of the Himalaya, king of mountains, and from which fell
unceasing flows of a rain of flowers of various colors; they were an
accumulation of all the adornments of the Trāyastriṃśa palace
 and could
not be destroyed by anyone.
 He saw many fruit trees called anupama-
svādu phala nicita, which had the form of gold mountain peaks
 and always
had perfect fruit that was always ripe. [F.55.a] He saw many trees of kings of
jewels called vairocanakośa that had the shapes of incomparable kings of
jewels and possessed perfect divine strings of jewels, necklaces, and
precious adornments that seemed to have come from the treasury of the
kings of wish-fulfilling jewels and were the source of jewels of countless
1155

colors. He saw many cloth trees called prasādana, which were adorned by
being strewn and hung with precious divine cloths of various colors. He saw
many music trees called pramodana, which emitted the sounds of beautiful
music from instruments superior to those of the devas. He saw many
perfume trees called samanta śubha vyūha, from which arose pleasing perfumes
of every kind of pleasant aroma spreading freely in all directions. There were
springs, ponds, reservoirs, and pools that had balustrades made of the seven
precious materials around them, with precious steps on all four sides,
encircled by precious platforms perfumed with the pleasant aroma of yellow
sandalwood, with perfectly laid bottoms made of precious blue beryl, the
king of jewels, and which were spread with the sand of Jambu River gold
and filled with aromatic divine water that had the eight qualities. Their
waters were covered with the various colors and divine scents of precious
lotuses, blue lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses; were filled with flocks
of various birds, with beauty that transcended the divine, emitting beautiful
sounds; and were beautified by being encircled with radiant trees made of
various divine jewels. Arranged at the feet of all those trees of various
jewels
 were precious lion thrones, with various beautiful forms, arrayed
in inconceivable adornments of various jewels, [F.55.b] adorned and spread
with divine precious cushions,
 perfumed by all kinds of scents and
incenses, hung with precious, beyond-divine ribbons, canopied by canopies
of various jewels, covered by nets
 of Jambu River gold and various
jewels, adorned by many
 precious beautiful nets of bells that emitted
beautiful sounds, and accompanied by many hundreds of thousands
 of
seats made of divine jewels.
1158
1159
1160
1161
1162
27. 4
He saw, arranged at the feet of some jewel trees, lion thrones with lotuses
in their centers that were made of jewels; at the feet of some, lion thrones
with lotuses in their centers that were made of the precious jewel king of
perfumes; at the feet of some, lion thrones with lotuses in their centers that
were made of the king of jewels array of nāgas; at the feet of some, lion thrones
with lotuses in their centers that were made of the king of precious jewels
lion’s trunk;
 at the feet of some, lion thrones with lotuses in their centers
that were made of the king of precious jewels the sun; at the feet of some, lion
thrones with lotuses in their centers that were made of the king of precious
jewels radiance; at the feet of some, lion thrones with lotuses in their centers
that were made of the king of precious jewels Indra’s vajra; at the feet of some,
lion thrones with lotuses in their centers that were made of the king of
precious jewels beauty of the world; and he saw, arranged at the feet of some
jewel trees, lion thrones with lotuses in their centers that were made of the
king of precious jewels white light.
1163


---

27. 5
He saw that the entire ground of that great park was covered with various
jewels like an ocean covered by islands of jewels.
27. 6
He saw that the land was beautified by blue beryl dust,
 was adorned
with various jewels, and was as pleasant and soft
 to the touch as down; it
sank as one stepped on it and rose as one lifted the foot;
 [F.56.a] its
surface was strewn with the petals
 of beautifully aromatic lotuses that
were pleasant to the touch and made of diamond jewels; it was filled with
ruddy shelducks,
 peacocks, cranes, snipes, avadavats, cuckoos,
 and
partridges that emitted beautiful sounds; it was adorned by perfectly formed
forests of many divine, precious sandalwood trees; there was a continuous
rainfall from clouds of lotuses made of various jewels and a rain of various
precious flowers; it was superior to Miśrakavana; there were kūṭāgāras made
of various jewels arrayed as adornments from within which constantly
emanated the unequaled
 aromas of the kings of perfumes; it was a
display superior to that of Sudharma, the meeting hall of the devas; they
were covered with nets of various jewels that were superior to divine jewels;
they were adorned by hanging bundles of pearls, jewels, and flowers;
they were entirely adorned by shining gold nets arrayed with a variety of
precious bells.
1164
1165
1166
1167
1168
1169
1170
1171
27. 7
Beautiful and pleasant music came from trees with a variety
 of musical
instruments, precious palm trees, and nets of bells when they were stirred by
the breeze. There arose the perfectly delightful sound of songs like those of
the apsarases of the king of the Vaśavartin devas. The park was beautified
by a rain that fell from clouds of divine cloths, of various colors, that fulfilled
all wishes. It resembled a vast ocean with a variety
 of colors and lusters
so that one could not stop looking at it. It was adorned by countless
hundreds of thousands of kūṭāgāras adorned with jewels.
 It was as
beautiful to behold as the residence
 of Indra
 in Trāyastriṃśa.
 It
was adorned by an array of various jewels of every kind. There was the
beautiful sight of an array of perfectly formed parasols standing erect. It was
made beautiful by various pinnacles,
 like the realm of great Indra. [F.56.b]
There shone constantly a great beautiful radiance of light. Like the divine
palace of Mahābrahmā, it was radiant with the light of the kings of jewels
that brought delight to beings.
1172
1173
1174
1175
1176
1177
1178
27. 8
That great park called Sūrya prabha, through the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha-
vijṛmbhitā’s great, inconceivable, miraculous abilities and attainment of
power,
 was as vast, immense, and extensive as the expanse of the sky
over countless world realms.
1179
27. 9
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw in that way the displays in the
park of aggregations of measureless, inconceivable qualities, which were
accomplished through the ripening of a bodhisattva’s karma; which were


---

born from vast, transcendent roots of merit that appeared as the natural
result of inconceivable offering and service to buddhas; which all the roots of
merit without exception in all worlds could not surpass; which were present
as the illusory nature of phenomena; which originated from the ripening of
the merit of vast, stainless virtue; which originated from the strength and
power that is the natural result of the conduct perfectly accomplished in the
past by the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā; which could not be surpassed by all
the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas; which could not be destroyed by
tīrthikas and opponents; which could not be harmed
 by any of the
activities of the path of the māras; and which could not be seen at all
 by
ordinary, foolish beings.
1180
1181
27. 10
He saw seated upon lion thrones at the feet of all those various precious
trees the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā surrounded by a great assembly.
 She
had a beautiful body, the peaceful conduct of a mendicant,
 pacified
senses,
 and a peaceful mind; she was perfectly self-controlled
 and had
conquered her senses; she was as perfectly tamed as an elephant; her mind
was as pure, clear, and unsullied as a lake; she fulfilled all wishes like a king
of wish-fulfilling jewels; [F.57.a] she was as unstained by worldly concerns
as a lotus by water; she was as free of fear and trepidation as a lion; because
of her perfectly pure confidence she was as unshakable as the great king of
mountains; because of her pure discipline she brought delight to beings like
the king of entrancing perfumes; like Himalayan sandalwood, she
extinguished the burning of the kleśas; like the beautiful king of herbs, she
brought an end to the sufferings of all beings; like the noose of Varuṇa, she
was a beneficial sight;
 like the light from a tathāgata, she brought peace
and happiness to body and mind; like Mahābrahmā, she was free from the
arising of anger, desire, and ignorance; like the king of jewels that purifies
water, she brought delight to the minds of beings that were turbid with
kleśas; and like a fertile land, she multiplied the roots of merit. On the
surrounding seats a diverse assembly was seated.
1182

1186
27. 11

27. 41
Similarly, he saw the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā teaching the Dharma to
classes of beings —those categorized as beings, who had different kinds of
births and states, beings who had been ripened, had correct behavior, and
were worthy recipients and who had various motivations, various
aspirations, constant motivations,
 and the strong elixir
 of faith —who
had come into this great park and were seated upon separate assembly
seats, teaching them the Dharma that would make them firmly established in
wishing to attain the highest, complete enlightenment.
1195
1196
27. 42
What was the cause of this? The bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā had practiced
countless hundreds of thousands of gateways to the perfection of wisdom
such as the complete sight of equanimity, the teaching of all the Dharmas of the
buddhas, the different bases of the realm of phenomena, the destruction of all the
domains of obscuration, the arising of the virtuous mind in all beings, the exceptional
display, the essence of the way of nonattachment, the domain of the nature of
phenomena, the treasure of the mind, and the essence of the complete attainment of
one’s aspirations.
27. 43
All those bodhisattvas and other beings who came to the great Sūrya-
prabha Park in order to see the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā and listen to the
Dharma had in the past been established by the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā in
the accomplishment of the roots of merit and set on irreversible progress
toward the highest, complete enlightenment. [F.60.a]


---

27. 44
In that way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha-
vijṛmbhitā’s perfect park, perfect forest,
 perfect vihāra, perfect walkway,
perfect enjoyments, perfect seat, perfect assembly, perfect supremacy,
perfect miraculous manifestations, and perfect display of eloquence. He
heard her inconceivable way of the Dharma. His mind was saturated by a
vast cloud of Dharma, and with perfect motivation toward
 the bhikṣuṇī
Siṃha vijṛmbhitā he thought, “I shall circumambulate her to my right many
hundreds of thousands of times.” In that instant, the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha-
vijṛmbhitā filled the entire park and the assembly with light. He
circumambulated her many hundreds of thousands of times
 and thought,
“As I circumambulated, the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā was always seated
before me.”
1197
1198
1199
27. 45
With his hands together in homage he stood before her and said, “Āryā, I
have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I
do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in
what way they should practice it. Āryā, I have heard that you give
instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and how they should
practice it!”
27. 46
She said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called the
eradication of all conceit.” [F.60.b]
27. 47
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is the scope of that bodhisattva liberation
called the eradication of all conceit?”
She replied, “Noble one, it is the light of wisdom; it has the nature of
perceiving in a fraction of an instant of mind the displays that occur in the
three times.”
27. 48
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is the scope of that light of wisdom?”
She replied, “Noble one, when I had striven for and accomplished
 this
light of wisdom,
 there arose the samādhi called accordance with all
Dharmas.
 With the attainment of that samādhi, I go in bodies that are
made of mind to the bodhisattvas with one life remaining who reside in
Tuṣita palaces in all the world realms in all ten directions, so that with bodies
as numerous as the atoms in an inexpressible number of buddha realms I can
engage in making offerings to each bodhisattva with offerings that are as
numerous as the atoms in an inexpressible number of buddha realms. This
means I go as the bodies of lords of devas and as the bodies of nāgas,
yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and
nonhumans, holding clouds of flowers, holding clouds of perfumes, holding
clouds of incense, holding clouds of garlands, holding clouds of ointments,
holding clouds of powders, holding clouds of clothing, holding clouds of
parasols, holding clouds of banners, holding clouds of flags, holding clouds
1200
1201
1202


---

of jewel ornamentations, holding clouds of arrays of nets of jewels, holding
clouds of arrays of bejeweled canopies, [F.61.a] holding clouds of arrays of
spread-out jewels,
 holding clouds of arrays of bejeweled lamps, and
holding clouds of arrays of bejeweled seats so as to engage in making
offerings.
1203
27. 49
“In the same way that I go to the bodhisattvas with one life remaining
who reside in Tuṣita so as to engage in making offerings, I go in bodies that
are made of mind and in such forms engage in offerings to all the tathāgatas
who have entered the bodies of their mothers, who are born, who reside
within harems, who have gone forth into homelessness, who are going to
the bodhimaṇḍa, who are present at the bodhimaṇḍa, who have attained the
highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood, who turn the wheel of the
Dharma, and who are entering nirvāṇa having satisfied the minds and
wishes of those who reside in the dwellings of the devas and those who
reside in the dwellings of the nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, and nonhumans and in the dwellings of all
beings.
27. 50
“Those beings who know my offerings and service to the buddhas will all
definitely attain the highest, complete enlightenment.
27. 51
“I give the instructions on the teachings of the perfection of wisdom to all
those beings who come to me.
27. 52
“Noble one, I look upon all beings with wisdom eyes, but I do not give rise
to the concept of ‘beings,’ and I do not become conceited. I listen to the
ocean of the languages of all beings but do not become attached to any way
of speaking, and I do not become conceited. I also see all the tathāgatas, but
through knowing the body of [F.61.b] the Dharma, I do not become
conceited. I possess the Dharma wheels of all the tathāgatas, but because I
have realized the nature of phenomena, I do not become conceited. In each
instant of mind I permeate the entire realm of phenomena, but because I
have realized the illusory nature of phenomena, I do not become conceited.
27. 53
“Noble one, I know this bodhisattva liberation called the eradication of all
conceit, but how could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who have comprehended the endless and centerless realm of
phenomena, who remain without conceit within all phenomena, who sitting
cross-legged alone pervade the entire realm of phenomena, who reveal all
buddha realms contained within their bodies, who in a single instant come
into the presence of all the tathāgatas, within whose bodies all the miracles
of the buddhas take place, who manifest and introduce within a single pore-
hair an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms, who manifest in their pores
the kalpas of the creation and destruction of an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of


---

countless world realms, who in one instant enter into the equality of
dwelling in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of kalpas, and who in one instant move
through an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of kalpas?
27. 54
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the land called Durga, in the
city called Ratnavyūha, dwells a courtesan by the name of Vasumitrā. Go to
her and ask her, [F.62.a] ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva
conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
27. 55
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā, circumambulated the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā
many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking
back again and again, departed from the bhikṣuṇī Siṃha vijṛmbhitā.
