MUKTAKA
8. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, then contemplated that power of
retention of the bodhisattvas called the light that is the display of Sarasvatī,
remembered that particular entry by the bodhisattvas into an ocean of
languages, remembered that particular entry by the bodhisattvas into the
way of subtlety,
 remembered that particular purity of the bodhisattvas
through 
purification 
of 
the 
mind, 
accomplished 
that 
particular
accomplishment by the bodhisattvas of creating the predispositions for roots
of merit, purified that particular bodhisattva gateway for ripening, refined
that particular bodhisattva wisdom that attracts beings, made firmer that
particular pure strength of bodhisattva motivation, stabilized that particular
strength of the superior motivation of the bodhisattvas, purified that lineage
of bodhisattva aspiration, developed
 that particular goodness that is in the
minds of the bodhisattvas, and entered into that particular commitment of
the bodhisattvas.
417
418
8. 2
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, displayed a continuity of strong
commitment, a mind of aspiration, and indefatigability. He had the
heroism
 of irreversible courage. He had the commitment of an irreversible
mind. He possessed the strength of unassailable faith. His motivation had
the indestructibility of the mighty vajra. [F.342.b] He had acquired with
reverence the instructions of all kalyāṇamitras. He had an unimpaired scope
of wisdom. He faced the completely pure gateways. He possessed the
unimpeded field of pure wisdom. He had the illumination of all-seeing
wisdom. He had attained the radiance of the retentive power of all levels.
His mind faced the separate bases of the realm of phenomena. He perceived
the nature of the pure display that is completely without any basis. He was
devoted to the unattached, unequaled,
 nondual field of activity. He had
the pure gateway of wisdom that surpasses all concepts. He had the
discrimination
 of all
 the separate directions and families.
 He had not

annulled the separate bases and directions of the world. He had not
annulled the separate bases and directions of the Dharma. He was dedicated
to the perception of the vision of the different directions and families
 of
the buddhas. He had the wisdom that comprehended the different directions
and bases of time. He had the understanding endowed with the radiance of
the wheel of the Dharma. The light of the complete radiance of wisdom and
samādhi illuminated his mind. He had the mind and body
 that had
reached the complete levels and ranges. He was continuously illuminated by
the radiance
 of the wisdom of the tathāgatas. He had given rise to the
power of faith in omniscience. He was never lacking in the power of faith in
the Buddhadharma. He possessed the blessing of the tathāgatas. He had
been illuminated by the light of the approach of his own mind to the
buddhas. He was endowed with the aspiration for his own body pervading
the network of all world realms. He was dedicated to accomplishing the
inclusion of the entire realm of phenomena within his own body.
424
425
426
8. 3
After twelve years [F.343.a] he eventually arrived at Vanavāsī. He
searched for the head merchant Muktaka and saw him. When he saw him, he
bowed down his entire body onto the ground in homage and sat before him.
8. 4
With palms together he said, “Ārya, today I have succeeded; I have
succeeded well. Why is that? Because I have met the kalyāṇamitra.
 It is
rare to have the opportunity to see the kalyāṇamitras. It is rare to have the
opportunity to find their appearance. It is rare to have the opportunity to
arrive where they are. It is rare to have the opportunity to go to where they
are, it is rare to have the opportunity to serve them, it is rare to have the
opportunity to approach
 them, it is rare to have the opportunity to dwell
with them, it is rare to have the opportunity to train with them, and it is rare
to have the opportunity to follow the kalyāṇamitras.
427
428
8. 5
“Today I have succeeded in being with the kalyāṇamitra.
 Ārya, I have
developed the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment in order to
serve all the buddhas; to venerate all the buddhas; to see all the buddhas; to
perceive all the buddhas; to comprehend the equality of all the buddhas; to
comprehend the prayers of all the buddhas; to fulfill the prayers of all the
buddhas; to have the light of the wisdom accomplished by all the buddhas;
to accomplish all buddhas within my own body; to accomplish the
knowledge of all the buddhas in my own conduct; to have the direct
perception of the miracles of all the buddhas; to purify the strengths and
fearlessnesses of all the buddhas; to never have enough of hearing the
Dharma that is taught by all the buddhas; [F.343.b] to hear and adopt the
Dharma that is taught by all the buddhas; to truly hold the Dharma that is
taught by all the buddhas; to become the same as all the bodhisattvas;
 to
be included among the bodhisattvas; to purify the conduct of all
429
430


---

bodhisattvas; to fulfill the perfections of all bodhisattvas; to purify the
accomplishment of the aspirations of all bodhisattvas; to attain the treasure
of the buddha blessings of all the bodhisattvas; to obtain the unceasing light
of wisdom that is all the bodhisattvas’ store of treasure of the Dharma; to
realize all the bodhisattvas’ store of treasure of samādhi;
 to accomplish the
immeasurable treasure of all the bodhisattvas; to realize all the bodhisattvas’
store of treasure of great compassion, which is the definitive guiding of
beings; to perceive all the bodhisattvas’ store of treasure of miracles; and to
gain the power in my own mind that is all the bodhisattvas’ store of power;
and for the array of all the aspects of all the bodhisattvas’ store of treasure of
purity.
431
8. 6
“Ārya, I have come here with such a motivation, [F.344.a] with such an
intention, with such joy,
 with such delight, with such thoughts, with such
an aspiration to accomplish certainty, with such an aspiration to conduct,
with such an aspiration to comprehend the way, with such a dedication to
purity, with such an intention for analysis,
 with such an oriented mind,
with such a dedication to goodness, and with senses focused in that way.
432
433
8. 7
“Ārya, I have heard
 that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas, that you teach the way, elucidate the way to understand, teach
the path, bring across the ford, open the gateway of the Dharma, cut through
doubts, dispel uncertainty, extract the splinter of prevarication, remove
hesitancy, illuminate the darkness of the mind, eliminate the stains of the
mind, clarify the continuity of the mind, remove the deception of the mind,
alleviate the distress of the mind, turn the mind away from saṃsāra, lead
away from bad actions, dissuade from going to the hells, bring freedom from
existence, liberate from attachment, banish all clinging, create the aspiration
for omniscience, enable entry into the city of the Dharma, bring to great
compassion, unite with great love, conjoin with bodhisattva conduct, cause
to enter the meditation of the gateway of samādhi, establish in the gateway
of realization, [F.344.b] establish in the comprehension of nature, spread the
possession of the strengths, and realize the equality of all beings.
434
8. 8
“Therefore, now that I have heard that, teach me, Ārya, how bodhisattvas
should learn
 bodhisattva conduct, how they train in it, how they are
dedicated to it, and how they quickly
 purify the domain of bodhisattva
conduct.”
435
436
8. 9
Then, at that time, the head merchant Muktaka the bodhisattva entered
the gateway of samādhi, the foremost gateway to the infinite circling of the
power of retention, called the assembly of all buddha realms, through the power
of past roots of merit, through the blessing of the tathāgatas, and through
the concentration that brings the light of wisdom of Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta.


---

8. 10
Immediately, the form of the head merchant Muktaka, who had entered
that samādhi, became a pure body. Because of the purity of his body, there
appeared within his body the presence of buddha bhagavats as numerous as
the atoms in the buddha realms in the ten directions, together with their
pure buddha realms, the assemblies of their pupils, their pure halos, their
past practice of conduct, their buddha miracles, their accumulation of
prayers, their pure display of conduct and setting forth, their demonstration
of the attainment of buddhahood, their teaching the wheel of the Dharma,
their ripening of beings, and their final conclusion of the Dharma.
8. 11
They were distinct from each other, [F.345.a] were not obscuring each
other,
 were perfectly separate from each other, were differentiated from
each other, remaining in different ways,
 and were perceived exactly as
they were. Their various arrays of buddha realms, the various adorning
assemblies of bodhisattva pupils, and the appearances of various buddha
miracles were seen.
437
438
8. 12
They were establishing the various yānas and reciting the various
gateways of prayers. They were seen in some worlds being born in a palace
in Tuṣita. They were seen to accomplish all the deeds of a buddha: in some
worlds they were descending from the palace in Tuṣita; in some they were
entering their mothers’ wombs and manifesting various miracles; in some
they were being born; in some they demonstrated playing as children; in
some they were in the middle of their harems; in some they were setting
forth in renunciation; in some they were arriving at the bodhimaṇḍa; in some
they were defeating the armies of Māra with vast miraculous manifestations;
in some they were encircled by devas, nāgas, yakṣas, and gandharvas, and
Brahmā and Indra
 were supplicating them to turn the wheel of the
Dharma; in some they were turning the wheel of the Dharma; in some they
were present in the abodes of all beings; and in some they were passing into
nirvāṇa. In some world realms there could be seen the distribution of the
relics of the tathāgatas that had passed into nirvāṇa, and in some buddha
realms devas and humans could be seen covering the caityas of the
tathāgatas with adornments.
439
8. 13
Those buddha bhagavats were teaching among the various classes of
beings, the various worlds of beings, [F.345.b] the various modes of beings,
the various births of beings, the various aggregations of beings, the various
successive roots of merit of beings, the various successive modes of beings,
the various successive thoughts of beings, the various successive
aspirations of beings, the various successive sensory faculties of beings, the
various successive times of beings, the various particular karmas of beings,
the various dissimilar karmas of beings, the various worlds of beings, the


---

various modes and conducts of beings, the various aspirations and conducts
in the ocean of beings, the various, different pure faculties, and the various
kleśas, predispositions, and propensities in the vast extent of beings.
8. 14
They did so through the demonstration of various kinds of buddha
miracles, through the accomplishment of the various word definitions in
various worlds, through various aspects of voice and language in various
worlds, through relating the ways of various sūtras, through the processes
of the various kinds of gateways to the power of retention, through the
production of various kinds of discernment, through the processes of an
ocean of various names for the truth, through various majestic lion’s roars of
the buddhas, through the demonstration of miracles that teach the roots of
merit to beings, through miracles that teach the various gateways of
memory, through the lion’s roar of various prophecies to bodhisattvas, and
through the power that arises from the various Dharma wheels of the
tathāgatas.
8. 15
The buddha bhagavats taught through the aspects of the voice of a
tathāgata and in accordance with all languages in the various assemblies of
pupils —which are limitless, infinitely different, and dependent on one
another —in the various vast, pure assemblies of pupils, [F.346.a] in the
gatherings of small assemblies of pupils, among those that are the length of
one yojana, the length of ten yojanas, the length of a hundred yojanas, and
so on, up to assemblies of pupils that are as many yojanas as there are atoms
in even more countless than countless buddha realms.
8. 16
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, heard, adopted, kept, and
contemplated all those Dharmas that were taught. He also saw those buddha
miracles. He saw the power of the majesty of that bodhisattva samādhi.
8. 17
Then the head merchant Muktaka mindfully and with awareness arose
from his samādhi and said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one,
I have obtained and hold the liberation of the tathāgatas called the unimpeded
display.
8. 18
“Noble one, when in that way I strove for and attained
 the liberation of
the tathāgatas called the unimpeded display, to my eyes appeared the tathāgata
arhat samyak saṃbuddha named Tāreśvararāja in the eastern world realm
called Jāmbū nada prabhāsa vatī. He was accompanied by an assembly that
was all bodhisattvas, such as the bodhisattva Vairocana garbha.
440
8. 19
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Samanta gandha vitāna in the southern world realm called Sarva bala vegavatī.
[F.346.b] He was accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas,
such as the bodhisattva Cintārāja.


---

8. 20
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Meru pradīpa rāja in the western world realm called Sarva gandha prabhāsa-
vatī. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas, such as
the bodhisattva Asaṅga citta.
8. 21
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Vajra pramardana in the northern world realm called Kāṣāyadhvajā. He was
accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas, such as the
bodhisattva Vajra pada vikrāmin.
8. 22
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Anilambha cakṣurvairocana
 in the northeastern world realm called Sarva-
ratna rucirā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas,
such as the bodhisattva Anilambha sunirmita.
441
8. 23
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Gandhapradīpa in the southeastern world realm called Gandhārciḥ prabhā-
svarā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all bodhisattvas, such
as the bodhisattva Sarva dharma dhātu tala bheda ketu rāja.
 [F.347.a]
442
8. 24
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Samanta mukha jñāna virocana ghoṣa in the southwestern world realm called
Sūrya kesara nirbhāsā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all
bodhisattvas, such as the bodhisattva Samanta kusumārciḥ pralamba cūḍa.
8. 25
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Apramāṇa guṇa sāgara prabha in the northwestern world realm called
Gandhālaṃkāra rucira śubha garbhā. He was accompanied by an assembly
that was all bodhisattvas, such as the bodhisattva Asaṅga kāya raśmi-
tejomati.443
8. 26
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Dharma dhātu vidyotita raśmi in the world realm below called Ratna-
siṃhāvabhāsa jvalanā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all
bodhisattvas, 
such 
as 
the 
bodhisattva 
Dharma dhātvarcirvairocana-
saṃbhava mati.
8. 27
“To my eyes appeared the tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha named
Apratihata guṇa kīrti vimokṣa prabha rāja in the world realm above called
Akṣaṇa rucira vairocanā. He was accompanied by an assembly that was all
bodhisattvas, such as the bodhisattva Asaṅga bala vīrya mati. [F.347.b]
8. 28
“Noble one, in that way, in addition to these ten
 tathāgatas, I see in the
ten directions tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddhas as numerous as the
atoms in the buddha realms in the ten directions, but those tathāgatas have
not come here and I have not gone there.
444
8. 29
“When I wish to, I see the Tathāgata Amitābha in the buddha realm
Sukhāvatī, I see the Tathāgata Vajrābha in the buddha realm Candana vatī, I
see the Tathāgata Ratnābha in the buddha realm Gandhavatī, I see the


---

Tathāgata Ratnapadmābha in the buddha realm Padmavatī, I see the
Tathāgata Śantābha in the buddha realm Kanaka vatī, I see the Tathāgata
Akṣobhya in the buddha realm Abhiratī, I see the Tathāgata Siṃha in the
buddha realm Supratiṣṭhā, I see the Tathāgata Candra buddhi in the buddha
realm Ādarśa maṇḍala nibhāsā, and I see the Tathāgata Vairocana in the
buddha realm Ratna śrī haṃsa citrā.445
8. 30
“Noble one, in that way, I see whatever tathāgata I wish to, in whatever
direction, in whatever world realm. I see whatever tathāgata I wish to, in
whatever time, in whatever location,
 in whatever past conduct. I see
whatever tathāgata I wish to, wherever he is accomplishing miracles
[F.348.a] or wherever he is guiding beings. And those tathāgatas have not
come here, nor have I gone there.
446
8. 31
“Noble one, in that way, I know that the tathāgatas have not come from
anywhere. I know my own body has not gone anywhere. I know that
perceiving the tathāgatas is like a dream, and I know that perceiving the
activity of my own mind is like having a dream. I know that the perception of
the tathāgatas is like a reflection, and I know that my own mind’s perception
is like a bowl of clear water. I know that the perception of the tathāgatas is
like that of forms created by a magical illusion, and I know that my own
mind’s perception is like a magical illusion. I know that the speech of the
tathāgatas is like echoes that sound in the mountains, and I know that my
own mind’s perception is like an echo.
8. 32
“It is thus that I understand, thus that I know that the entire
Buddhadharma of the bodhisattvas arises from the blessing of one’s own
mind. All the pure buddha realms are the blessing of one’s own mind. The
bodhisattva conduct also is the blessing of one’s own mind. The ripening
and guidance of all beings is the blessing of one’s own mind. The fulfillment
of the aspirations of the bodhisattvas is the blessing of one’s own mind.
Arriving at the city of omniscience is the blessing of one’s own mind.
[F.348.b] Delighting in inconceivable liberations is the blessing of one’s own
mind. At attainment, the enlightenment of buddhahood is the blessing of
one’s own mind. The miraculous manifestation of the powerful majesty of
uniting the entire realm of phenomena is the blessing of one’s own mind.
The wisdom that unites all kalpas into a brief time is the blessing of one’s
own mind.
8. 33
“Noble one, this is what I think: one’s own mind should be supported by
all roots of merit, one’s own mind should be moistened by the clouds of the
Dharma, one’s own mind should be purified of obscuring phenomena,
one’s own mind should be made firm by diligence, one’s own mind should
be made tranquil by patience, one’s own mind should be cultivated by the
comprehension of knowledge, one’s own mind should be refined by
447


---

wisdom, one’s own mind should have accomplishment in power, one’s own
mind should be made vast in the equality of the buddhas, and one’s own
mind should be illuminated by the ten strengths of the tathāgatas.
8. 34
“Noble one, I know, have adopted, and keep this liberation called the
unimpeded display of the tathāgatas, but how could I know or describe the
qualities of dwelling without impediment in the field of activity of the
unimpeded minds of the bodhisattvas; the attainment of the samādhi of the
direct perception of all the buddhas in the present; the attainment of the
samādhi gateway to the enlightenment that has reached the apex that is
without passing into nirvāṇa; [F.349.a] the attainment of the sameness of the
three times; the knowledge of the way of the field of activity of the samādhi
of the completely undivided basis; the bodies distributed throughout all
buddha realms; the presence in the indivisible ranges of the buddhas; the
field of activity that is oriented toward all directions; the view of the domain
of undivided wisdom; and the conduct that is free of the dualistic
conceptions of self and world, even though in their bodies there appears the
destruction and creation of all world realms?
8. 35
“Now depart, noble one. On this road to the south, at the tip of
Jambudvīpa, there is Milaspharaṇa. There dwells a bhikṣu by the name of
Sāgara dhvaja. Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in
bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva proceed?’ ”
8. 36
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
head merchant Muktaka, circumambulated the head merchant Muktaka a
hundred thousand times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again
and again, beautifully describing, examining, and aspiring to the countless
qualities of the head merchant Muktaka, thinking of Muktaka, [F.349.b] he
was weeping and wailing as he departed from head merchant Muktaka; he
was thinking of kalyāṇamitras with affection, trusting in them, longing to
honor the kalyāṇamitras, maintaining obedience to the instructions of
kalyāṇamitras, 
and 
seeing 
omniscience 
as 
dependent 
upon 
the
kalyāṇamitras; his thoughts focused on the kalyāṇamitras, his conduct
faithful to the kalyāṇamitras, and being in the power of the minds of the
kalyāṇamitras, by avoiding anything that would be harmful to the
kalyāṇamitras he regarded them as his mother and, by developing all the
qualities of roots of merit, regarded them as his father.
