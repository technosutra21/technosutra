MAITRAYAṆĪ
13. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, with inconceivable respect
 for
kalyāṇamitras, with a pure, vast
 aspiration, intent on the Mahāyāna,
aspiring 
to 
the 
wisdom 
of 
buddhahood, 
[F.388.a] 
following 
the
Buddhadharma, longing to follow the kalyāṇamitras, practicing veneration
of the Dharma,
 intent on unimpeded wisdom, with conviction in the
highest goal, being within the range of the apogee of wisdom,
comprehending the three times in a fraction of an instant, intent on the
nondual apogee of space, having attained certainty in the apogee of
nonduality, dwelling in the nonconceptual apogee of the realm of the
Dharma, having entered the comprehension of the way that is the apogee of
being free of obscurations, dedicated to the harmony that is the apogee of
action,
 realizing that the apogee of the tathāgatas is without an apogee,
dwelling in the nonconceptuality that is the apogee of the buddhas,
 and
dedicated to the wisdom that disperses the network of conceptualizations of
all beings, had a mind free from all attachment to realms, free from
attachment to all the circles of followers of the buddhas, and practiced,
without dwelling in any location, the purification of all buddha realms; he
had the recognition that there is no self and no beings within all beings,
comprehended that all sounds are like echoes,
 and was dedicated to the
realization that all forms are the same as reflections of forms.

Sudhana eventually arrived at the city of Siṃha vijṛmbhita. He searched for
and sought the maiden Maitrayaṇī and heard that Maitrayaṇī, the daughter
of King Siṃhaketu, with her entourage of five hundred maidens, was in a
palace called Vairocana garbha. [F.388.b] She was teaching the Dharma while
seated on a throne that had uragasāra sandalwood legs, was draped in a
network of threads of gold, and had a cushion made of divine material.

13. 3
Sudhana entered the city of Siṃha vijṛmbhita and went to the residence of
King Siṃhaketu. He sat at the king’s outer gate hoping to see the maiden
Maitrayaṇī.
13. 4
Sudhana saw many hundreds of people, many thousands of people, many
hundreds of thousands of people there.
13. 5
He asked them, “Where have you come from? Where are you going?”
They replied, “We have come to hear the Dharma from the maiden
Maitrayaṇī.”
Sudhana thought, “It seems as if everyone is allowed to go in,” and he
went inside.
13. 6
When he had gone inside and looked around, he saw that the Vairocana-
garbha palace had the inconceivable display of a floor that was made of
crystal, pillars made of beryl, and walls made of diamonds; it was adorned
with hundreds of thousands of pinnacles made of solid gold, was furnished
with round mirrors made of the essence of a thousand precious materials,
and was adorned with countless precious jewels; it was arrayed with
precious jewels that delighted beings and was strewn with countless nets of
jewels;
 and there was the melodious sound from hundreds of thousands
of jingling golden bells.
760
13. 7
He saw the maiden Maitrayaṇī, who had deep black eyes,
 deep black
hair, and golden skin.
761
13. 8
Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of the maiden Maitrayaṇī,
circumambulated her, keeping her to his right, many hundreds of thousands
of times, [F.389.a] and with his hands together in homage sat down before
her.
13. 9
Sudhana said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
13. 10
“Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to
bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
13. 11
Maitrayaṇī said, “Noble one, look at the display of my residence!”
Sudhana looked all around and saw in each wall, each pillar, each round
mirror, each form, each shape, each precious jewel, each golden bell, each
precious tree, each pore, and each string of jewels the images of the
tathāgatas in all the realm of phenomena first developing their aspiration for
enlightenment, their conduct and the scope of their prayers, the display of
their setting forth, their manifestation of the attainment of buddhahood, their
turning the wheel of the Dharma, and their demonstration of passing into
nirvāṇa. What he saw from one object of perception he saw from all the
objects of perception. For example, there appeared in a lake filled with water


---

that was unpolluted and clear [F.389.b] the reflection of the sky, the sun, the
moon, and the constellations of stars. In the same way, in every object of
perception within the Vairocana garbha palace appeared the reflections of all
the tathāgatas present in the entire realm of phenomena as the result of the
maiden Maitrayaṇī’s previous roots of merit.
13. 12
When Sudhana had seen and remembered the features of this display of
the vision of the buddhas, with his hands together in homage he looked at
Maitrayaṇī’s face.
13. 13
She said to him, “Noble one, I have attained the teaching
 of the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the complete display. I sought this teaching
of the gateway to the perfection of wisdom called the complete display from as
many tathāgatas as there are grains of sand in three hundred and sixty
million Ganges Rivers. Those tathāgatas, through making me enter various
gateways, made me realize the teaching of the gateway to the perfection of
wisdom called the complete display. What was taught by any one of them was
not taught by another of them.”
762
13. 14
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is the scope of this teaching of the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the complete display?”
Maitrayaṇī answered, “Noble one, having been made to face, reflect on,
follow, practice, contemplate, approach,
 grasp, display, attain, adorn, and
analyze this teaching of the gateway to the perfection of wisdom called the
complete display, [F.390.a] there arose the power of retention called the complete
gateways. Countless millions of Dharma gateways are present, are included,
are manifest, are collected, and are arranged
 within the range of that
power of retention.

“However, noble one, I know only this teaching of the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the complete display of memory. How could I know
or describe the qualities of the bodhisattvas whose minds are as vast as the
realm of space, whose understanding is as vast as the realm of phenomena,
whose continuum is supported by an accumulation of merit, who follow a
path that transcends the world, who do not engage with worldly qualities,

“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a land called
Trinayana. There dwells a bhikṣu by the name of Sudarśana. Go to him and
ask him, ‘How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
13. 18
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
maiden Maitrayaṇī, circumambulated the maiden Maitrayaṇī, keeping her to
his right, many hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking back again and

again, departed from the presence of the maiden Maitrayaṇī.
