## 45. Chapter 45

# SURENDRĀBHĀ

45. 1 Sudhana went to the paradise of the lord of Trāyastriṃśa and approached
    the deva maiden Surendrābhā, the daughter of the deva Smṛtimat. He bowed
    his head to the feet of the deva maiden Surendrābhā, circumambulated the
    deva maiden Surendrābhā many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping
    her to his right, and then stood before the deva maiden Surendrābhā with his
    palms together in homage and said, “Āryā, goddess, I have developed the
    aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
    bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
    should practice it. Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings
    to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train
    in bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
45. 2 When he had said that, the deva maiden Surendrābhā said to Sudhana, the
    head merchant’s son, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation
    called _the display of pure, unimpeded memory_.
45. 3 “Noble one, I remember a kalpa called Utpala in which I served as many
    tathāgatas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. [F.272.a] When
    they set forth, I protected them, made offerings to them, and gave them
    parks to enjoy.
45. 4 “I know when those buddha bhagavats were bodhisattvas, were within
    the bodies of their mothers, were born, took their first seven steps, roared the
    lion’s roar, were youths, were within their harems, set forth into
    homelessness, attained the enlightenment of buddhahood, turned the wheel
    of the Dharma, and displayed all the miraculous manifestations of a buddha,
    and when they ripened and guided beings, throughout all those times, from
    their first development of the aspiration for enlightenment until their final
    Dharma teaching. I remember that, recollect that, grasp that, retain that,
    reflect upon that, and follow that.


45. 5 “There was a kalpa called Subhūti, in which I served as many tathāgatas
    as there are grains of sand in ten Ganges Rivers.
45. 6 “There was a kalpa called Subhaga, in which I served as many tathāgatas
    as there are atoms in a buddha realm.
       “There was a kalpa called Anilambha, in which I served eighty-four
    hundred thousand quintillion tathāgatas.
45. 7 “There was a kalpa called Suprabha, in which I served as many tathāgatas
    as there are atoms in Jambudvīpa.
       “There was a kalpa called Atulaprabha, in which I served as many
    tathāgatas as there are grains of sand in twenty Ganges Rivers.
45. 8 “There was a kalpa called Uttaptaśrī, in which I served as many tathāgatas
    as there are grains of sand in one Ganges River. [F.272.b]
       “There was a kalpa called Sūryodaya, in which I served as many
    tathāgatas as there are grains of sand in eighty Ganges Rivers.
45. 9 “There was a kalpa called Jayaṃgama, in which I served as many
    tathāgatas as there are grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers.
       “There was a kalpa called Sucandra, in which I served as many tathāgatas
    as there are grains of sand in seventy Ganges Rivers.
45. 10 “Noble one, in that way, I remember never being apart from the tathāgata
    arhat samyak saṃbuddhas throughout kalpas as numerous as the grains of
    sand in the Ganges River. I heard from all those tathāgatas this bodhisattva
    liberation called _the display of pure, unimpeded memory_. I heard it and retained it.
    I comprehended whatever they said. I have constantly, always remained
    within this liberation. Through this bodhisattva liberation called _the display of_
    _pure, unimpeded memory_ , I remember those tathāgatas from the time they
    attained the level of a bodhisattva until the time their Dharma ceased to exist.
    I recollect that, grasp that, retain that, reflect upon that, and follow that.

45. (^11) “Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called _the display of
pure, unimpeded memory_. How could I know or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who are free from the blindness of darkness, who have risen
out of saṃsāra, who are free of obscurations, who aspire not to be asleep,
who are free of apathy and idleness, whose body formations are purified,
who continuously understand the nature of all phenomena, [F.273.a] and
who have realized the pure ten strengths?

45. 12 “Depart, noble one. In the great city of Kapilavastu resides a teacher of
    children by the name of Viśvāmitra. Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a
    bodhisattva train in and practice bodhisattva conduct?’ ”
45. 13 Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, filled with joy, delighted, elated,
    pleased, and happy, bowed his head to the feet of the deva maiden
    Surendrābhā. He circumambulated the deva maiden Surendrābhā many


hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back
at her again and again, departed from the deva maiden Surendrābhā.
