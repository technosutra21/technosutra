Chapter 12
JAYOṢMĀYATANA
12. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was illuminated by the wisdom of the
bodhisattva liberation called the banner of being invincible to others. He dwelled
in the direct experience of the inconceivable range of the miraculous
manifestations of the buddhas. He perceived the direct knowledge of
inconceivable bodhisattva liberations. His mind was illuminated by the
wisdom of inconceivable bodhisattva samādhis. He had attained the
radiance of the wisdom of samādhi that is present at all times. He was
illuminated by the range of samādhi, in which all perceptions are present
and included. He had obtained the light of the wisdom that transcends all
worlds. He had the direct perception of dwelling in the entire range of the
three times.
 He was devoted to the wisdom that teaches equality without
dualistic conceptions. He had the light of wisdom that pervaded
throughout all objects of perception. He had mastered the treasury of
aspiration for pure patience toward all that is heard.
 He had attained the
definitive wisdom
 of patience for natural phenomena. His mind was never
apart from meditation on the nature of the bodhisattva conduct
 of higher
cognition. His mind was irreversibly progressing toward the power of
omniscience. He had attained the illumination of the knowledge
 of the ten
strengths. His mind was never content in its aspiration to hear the sound of
the words of the realm of Dharma. [F.380.b] His mind had gained entry into
the field of dwelling in omniscience. His mind had attained the infinite
display of bodhisattva conduct. His mind was purified
 by the infinite
domain of great
 bodhisattva prayers. He had the mind with direct
perception of the limitless knowledge without limit or center of the
unceasing network
 of world realms. He had the mind that never wearies
in ripening and guiding the infinite ocean of beings. He saw the infinite
range of bodhisattva conduct. He saw the infinite diversity of the different
world realms. He saw the small and the vast objects of perception included

within the infinite world realms. He saw the various networks of names that
are the bases for infinite world realms. He saw the various infinite, differing
relative designations and terms for infinite world realms. He saw the infinite,
differing aspirations of beings. He saw the infinite, differing categories of
beings. He saw the infinite practices for guiding and ripening beings. He
saw the various infinite perceptions
 of the directions and times of beings.
[F.381.a]
727
12. 2
Focused on the kalyāṇamitra, Sudhana eventually arrived in the land
called Īṣāṇa and went to where the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana was.
12. 3
At that time, the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana was practicing the basis for
accomplishing omniscience and practicing extreme asceticism. On all four
sides of himself he had lit fires the size of mountains. Towering above was
the precipice of a great mountain with a path of razors leading up it.728
12. 4
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana, sat down before him, and with his hands together
in homage said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment. How does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva
conduct? In what way does a bodhisattva practice it? Ārya, I have heard that
you teach and give instructions to bodhisattvas. Therefore, Ārya, teach me
how bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
practice it!”
12. 5
The brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana said, “Noble one, go and climb up this
mountain on the path of razors and then jump down into this fire. In that
way, your bodhisattva conduct will become pure.”
12. 6
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, thought, “It is rare to avoid the eight
unfavorable existences. It is rare to become a human.
 It is rare to have pure
good fortune. It is rare to have the appearance of a buddha. [F.381.b] It is rare
to have unimpaired senses. It is rare to hear the Buddhadharma. It is rare to
meet a higher being. It is rare to have the friendship of a true kalyāṇamitra. It
is rare to gain the teaching of the true way. It is rare to have a right
livelihood. It is rare in the human world to practice the Dharma and the
ancillary Dharmas.
729
12. 7
“This person who will create an obstacle to my roots of merit, who urges
me to kill myself, is he a māra? Is he blessed by a māra? Is he a follower of
Māra? Is he pretending to be a kalyāṇamitra? Is he someone who destroys
bodhisattvas? Does he wish to prevent me from attaining omniscience? Does
he wish to lead me down a wrong path? Is he creating an obstacle to the
gateway of the Dharma through which one realizes the Buddhadharma?”
730
12. 8
When Sudhana had these thoughts, ten thousand Brahmās who were up
in the sky said to him, “Noble one, do not be unrelenting in these thoughts!
This ārya has attained the illumination of the samādhi vajra light rays. He has


---

unwavering diligence. He has set out on the greatest undertaking. He is
dedicated to drying up the moisture of craving in all beings. He is dedicated
to cutting through the nets of wrong views. He is prepared to incinerate the
forest
 of kleśas.
 [F.382.a] He is dedicated to illuminating all the desolate
areas of unfavorable knowledge.
 He has the resolute commitment to turn
all beings away from the terror of the chasm
 of aging and death. He is
dedicated to dispelling the darkness in the three times. He radiates the light
rays of the entire Dharma.
731
732
733
734
12. 9
“Noble one, while this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five
heats,
 through the power of his commitment to asceticism
 and self-
discipline, Brahmās who were accomplished and powerful, who arrogantly
thought of themselves as preeminent in all worlds, and who were attached
to a variety of incorrect views ceased to take pleasure in their state and no
longer enjoyed the taste of their dhyāna, and they came into the presence of
this ārya. When they had arrived, through the overpowering might
 of this
ārya’s miracles and his fierce discipline and asceticism, they were all turned
away from their wrong views, and he taught them the Dharma so that they
would abandon all their pride and arrogance. He taught them the Dharma so
that they would have great love and great compassion that spread over all
beings, so that they would have an unwavering wish for enlightenment, so
that they would develop a vast aspiration for enlightenment, so that they
would be dedicated to seeing all the buddhas, so that they would have the
complete attainment of the domain of the speech of the buddhas, and so that
there would be everywhere without obscuration or impediment the sound of
the voices of the buddhas.” [F.382.b]
735
736
737
12. 10
Ten thousand māras were also in the sky above, scattering divine precious
jewels. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya was enduring the ascetic
practice of the five heats, from this mass of light rays came a great radiance
that outshone all our residences, bodies, adornments, and possessions.
Therefore, we too ceased to take pleasure in our residences, and with our
entourages we came into the presence of this ārya. When we had come
before him, this ārya taught us the Dharma so that our minds were healed,
we developed the aspiration for enlightenment, and we became irreversible
on the way to the highest, complete enlightenment.”
12. 11
Ten thousand Vaśavartin deva kings were also in the sky above,
scattering divine flowers. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya was
enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we also ceased to take delight
in our residences, and therefore each of us, without entourages, came into
the presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us the
Dharma so that we gained control over our own minds. He taught us the
Dharma so that we would have power over all kleśas, so that we would have


---

the power to be reborn wherever we wish, so that we would have the power
to purify the obscuration of karma, so that we would have power over all
meditative states, so that we would have power over requisites, [F.383.a] and
so that we would have the power to live as long as we wish.”
12. 12
Ten thousand Sunirmita deva kings were also in the sky above, singing
out a melodious roar of divine songs. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya
was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats there came from those
masses of flames a corresponding light that purified, illuminated, and
brightened our aerial palaces. It also illuminated and brightened our
adornments and our apsarases. Then we ceased to take delight in our
entourage of young devas and apsarases. We ceased to delight in the bliss of
desire, and our bodies and minds were left unsatisfied. We came into the
presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us the
Dharma so that our minds would be purified. He taught us the Dharma so
that our minds would be brightened, so that our minds would be very
pure,
 so that our minds would be tractable, so that our minds would be
joyful, so that we would have the pure attainment of the knowledge of the
ten strengths, so as to increase the great power of the Dharma, so as to purify
our bodies, so as to attain an immeasurable buddha body, so as to purify our
speech, and so as to attain the voice of a buddha.”
738
12. 13
Ten thousand Saṃtuṣita deva kings were also in the sky with
 an
entourage of deva youths and apsarases, [F.383.b] all of whom were paying
homage and making an offering of sending down rain from clouds of
various scented powders. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya was
enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we ceased to take delight in
our residences. As we had ceased to take delight in them, we came into the
presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us the
Dharma so that we would not be dependent on any sensory object. He
taught us the Dharma so that our minds would have contentment, so that we
would create the roots of merit, so that we would attain the development of
the aspiration for enlightenment, and so that we would be able to fulfill the
entire Buddhadharma.”
739
12. 14
Ten thousand Suyāma deva kings were also in the sky with an entourage
of deva youths and apsarases, all of whom were sending down a rain of
divine coral tree flowers. They said, “Noble one, while this ārya was
enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we ceased to take delight in
listening to divine songs. As we had ceased to take delight in them, we came
into the presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us
the Dharma so that we would turn away from all delight in desires and so
that we would attain all of the Buddhadharma.”


---

12. 15
Ten thousand Śakras, lords of devas, each with their thirty-two secondary
lords and an entourage of deva youths and apsarases, were also in the sky.
They were dropping down rain from clouds of divine clothing, precious
adornments, and flowers. They said, “Noble one, [F.384.a] when this ārya
was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we ceased to take delight
in Śakra’s palace, park, pleasure groves, the playing of divine music,
attendants, and songs. As we had ceased to take delight in them, we came
into the presence of this ārya. When we came into his presence, he taught us
the Dharma so that we would renounce all delight in desires. He said, ‘All
these have the qualities of being impermanent, unstable, and decaying.’ He
taught us the Dharma so that our arrogance and carelessness would end and
we would develop the aspiration for the highest enlightenment.
12. 16
“Moreover, noble one, just by his gaze these peaks of Meru are shaken.
We became alarmed on being shaken, and as the omniscient mind cannot be
disturbed, we made the prayer to attain omniscient wisdom.”
12. 17
Ten thousand nāgas such as the nāga kings Airāvata, Nanda, and
Upananda were also in the sky above. They were sending down rain from
clouds of divine yellow sandalwood, the pleasant sound of a chorus of nāga
maidens, and rain that was a flow of divine scented water. They said, “Noble
one, when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, from
this great fire shone a great light that illuminated all the dwellings of nāgas
and eliminated the rains of sand and fear of the garuḍas. [F.384.b] It also
pacified anger, refreshed our bodies,
 and made our minds serene.
 Then
when we had serene minds, this ārya taught us the Dharma so that we
would repudiate the evil ways of nāgas, renounce all karma that brings
obscuration, confess transgressions, develop the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, and be established in omniscience.”
740
741
12. 18
Ten thousand yakṣa lords were also in the sky above. They made various
kinds of offerings to the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana and Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, and then they said, “Noble one, when this ārya was
enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, we and all our retinues
developed a loving mind toward humans. All yakṣas, rākṣasas, and
kumbhāṇḍas also developed loving minds. They came before us with loving
minds and without violence. We too were overpowered by the power of love,
and each of us ceased to delight in our own residences. In that way, we each
went with our retinues to the presence of the ārya. When we arrived, a light
came from this ārya’s body, illuminated all our bodies, and filled us with
bliss. In that way, both our bodies and minds became blissful. Then he
taught us the Dharma so that the multitude of yakṣas, rākṣasas,
kumbhāṇḍas, 
and 
kaṭapūtanas 
would 
develop 
the 
aspiration 
to
enlightenment.”


---

12. 19
Ten thousand gandharva lords [F.385.a] were also in the sky above, and
they said, “Noble one, while we were each dwelling in our own abodes, and
when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, from this
fire came a light that illuminated our abodes. When that light struck us we
experienced inconceivable bliss. We went to be in the presence of this ārya,
and when we arrived in his presence, he taught us the Dharma so that we
would progress irreversibly toward the highest, complete enlightenment.”
12. 20
Ten thousand asura lords rose up from the ocean, high into the sky, where
they knelt on their right knees, and with hands together in homage they
paid homage, saying, “Noble one, when this ārya was enduring the ascetic
practice of the five heats, our asura world, a great circle of earth with its
oceans and mountains, shook. All our arrogance and pride was
overwhelmed by his self-discipline and asceticism. We went to be in the
presence of this ārya, and when we arrived in his presence, he taught us the
Dharma so that we would abandon all deception, enter the patience of the
profound Dharma, be established in the unshakable true nature of
phenomena, and attain the knowledge of the ten strengths.”
12. 21
Ten thousand garuḍa lords [F.385.b] such as the garuḍa lord
Mahāvegadhārin manifested in the form of handsome brahmin
 youths
and said, “Noble one, when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of
the five heats, a great light came from these great masses of fire and
illuminated and shook our abodes. We were frightened, terrified, and
dismayed, and so we went to be in the presence of this ārya. This ārya taught
us the Dharma so that we would practice great love, so that we were
established in great compassion, so that we would apply ourselves to
plunging into the ocean of saṃsāra, so that we would apply ourselves to
saving beings who are sinking in the swamp of desire, so that we would
apply ourselves to the pure gateway of the higher motivation for
enlightenment,
 so that we would apply ourselves to sharp
 wisdom and
methods, and so that we would apply ourselves to guiding beings in
whatever way will ripen them.”
742
743
744
12. 22
Ten thousand kinnara lords were also in the sky. They said, “Noble one,
when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five heats, the sound
of the word Buddha, the word Dharma, the words irreversible bodhisattva Saṅgha,
and the words the prayer to reach enlightenment came from the rows of palm
trees, the music of the garlands of strings of networks of little bells on our
trees,
 the musical instruments, the precious jewelry, the enjoyed
possessions in the homes, and the blowing of the breezes
 in our domain.
There came the words that said that in this and that particular world a
bodhisattva named such and such is praying to attain enlightenment;
[F.386.a] in this and that particular world a bodhisattva named such and such
745
746


---

is accomplishing a difficult renunciation; in this and that particular world a
bodhisattva named such and such is purifying the domain of omniscient
wisdom; in this and that particular world a bodhisattva named such and
such is going to the bodhimaṇḍa; in this and that particular world a
bodhisattva named such and such has defeated Māra, and his army is
attaining the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood; in this and
that particular world a tathāgata named such and such is turning the wheel
of the Dharma; in this and that particular world a tathāgata named such and
such, having accomplished all the deeds of a buddha without remainder, is
passing away into the state of nirvāṇa without any remaining skandhas.
12. 23
“Noble one, it is possible that there could be an end to the number of
atoms from all the plants, wood, branches, leaves, and petals in Jambudvīpa,
but there is no end to the number of the names of tathāgatas, of the
bodhisattva prayers, and of the different engagements in bodhisattva
conduct that come from, resound from, and are heard from the rows of palm
trees and so on up to
 the musical instruments, the precious jewelry, the
enjoyed possessions in the homes, [F.386.b] and the blowing of the breezes
in our domain.
747
12. 24
“In that way, we experienced bliss through the intense joy of hearing the
sound of a river
 of the words Buddha, Dharma,
 and Saṅgha, the prayers
and conduct engaged in by bodhisattvas, and their names.
748
749
12. 25
“We each went to be in the presence of the ārya. When we arrived in his
presence, this ārya taught us the Dharma so that we would become
irreversible in our progress to the highest, complete enlightenment.”
12. 26
Countless thousands of desire-realm devas with beautiful bodies
 were
also in the sky, making offerings with mentally emanated offerings. They
said, “Noble one, when this ārya was enduring the ascetic practice of the five
heats, a light came from these great masses of fire. That light illuminated
beings as far down as the Avīci hell and extinguished the sufferings of all
the beings in the hells. That light brought the image of this ārya to our eyes,
and therefore we yearned for this ārya and experienced the bliss of the realm
of desire devas.
 In that way, we were grateful to him, never ceased
wanting to see him, and renounced delighting in desires. We went to be in
the presence of this ārya. This ārya taught us the Dharma so that we would
pray for the enlightenment of limitless beings.” [F.387.a]
750
751
12. 27
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, on hearing this way of the
Dharma, was overjoyed, pleased, happy, and content. He recognized the
brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana to be a true kalyāṇamitra. He bowed his head to the
feet of the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana and said, “Ārya, I confess my
transgression of having disobeyed a kalyāṇamitra’s instruction.”


---

12. 28
Then the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana recited this verse to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son:
12. 29
“The bodhisattva who successfully follows the instructions
And who is mindful not to disobey the guru’s words752
Will successfully accomplish all goals and successfully
Attain the wisdom of buddhahood, enlightened under the Bodhi tree.”
12. 30
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, climbed the path of razors up the
mountain precipice and jumped down into the great mass of fire. When he
jumped, he attained the bodhisattva samādhi called completely stable. When he
landed in the fire, he attained the bodhisattva samādhi called perceiving the
bliss of peace.
12. 31
Sudhana said, “I am astonished, Ārya! The touch of the fire was blissful,
and the mountain path of razors was also blissful to the touch.”
12. 32
The brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana said, “Noble one, I have attained the
bodhisattva liberation called the unceasing domain. [F.387.b] However, noble
one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the unceasing domain. How
could I know or describe the qualities of the bodhisattvas who are like
masses of fire, who pray to eliminate all the kleśas and wrong views of all
beings, who have an ensign
 that is never in retreat, who have invincible
minds, who have minds that never despair, who have minds that are never
despondent, who are like Nārāyaṇa possessing the vajra essence, who reach
the conclusion of their great undertakings, who have no despondency, who
never slacken, who are like whirlwinds, who are dedicated to the benefit of
all beings, who have irreversible diligence, and who wear the armor of
irreversibility?
753
12. 33
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a city called Siṃha-
vijṛmbhita. There dwells Maitrayaṇī, the daughter of King Siṃhaketu, with
her entourage of five hundred maidens. Go to her and ask her, ‘How does a
bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How does a bodhisattva practice
it?’ ”
12. 34
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana, circumambulated the brahmin Jayoṣmāyatana,
keeping him to his right, many hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking
back again and again, departed from the presence of the brahmin
Jayoṣmāyatana.
