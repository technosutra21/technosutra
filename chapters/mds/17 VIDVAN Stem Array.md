VIDVĀN
17. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had obtained the light of the liberation
called the unceasing display of the treasure of merit. He contemplated that ocean
of merit. He viewed that sky of merit. He obtained that heap of merit. He
climbed that mountain of merit. He accumulated that store
 of merit. He
immersed himself in that river of merit. [F.11.b] He descended the steps into
the bathing place of that merit. He purified that field of merit. He looked at
that treasure of merit. He thought of that way of merit. He paid attention
to that tradition
 of merit. He purified that lineage of merit.

Eventually he arrived at the town called Mahāsaṃbhava and searched,
sought, and looked around
 for the householder Vidvān.
967
17. 3
He searched for the householder Vidvān while longing for kalyāṇamitras,
with his being transformed by seeing kalyāṇamitras, with an aspiration that
was the blessing of the kalyāṇamitras, with dedication to following
kalyāṇamitras, with diligence in tireless service of the kalyāṇamitras, with all
the roots of merit of relying on kalyāṇamitras, with all the accumulation of
merit through being faithful to the kalyāṇamitras, with the practice of the
skillful methods increased by the kalyāṇamitras, with skill in serving the
kalyāṇamitras without relying on anyone else, and while increasing all his
roots of merit, purifying the bodhisattva motivation, increasing the
bodhisattva faculties, ripening all roots of merit, increasing the fulfillment of
great prayers, making great compassion vast, seeing himself as coming close
to omniscience, receiving the Dharma radiance of the completely good
bodhisattva conduct from all the buddhas, and increasing the illumination of
the ten strengths of the tathāgatas.

17. 4
He saw the householder Vidvān at the crossroads in the center of the
town. He was upon a dais made of the seven precious materials. He was
seated upon an excellent throne made of countless jewels. [F.12.a] Its legs of
precious jewels were adorned with various diamonds and sapphires. It was


---

covered with a network of strings of gold. It contained stainless precious
jewels. Its form was decorated with five hundred jewels. Various cushions of
divine material were set upon it. Around it stood streamers, banners, and
flags made of divine cloth. It was covered by a net of strings of many jewels.
Overhead was a great bejeweled canopy, from which hung wreaths of
flowers of gold and jewels.
17. 5
A parasol of Jambu River gold was held aloft
 by its stainless handle
made of beryl. Vidvān was being fanned by precious stainless fans made of
the feathers of the king of geese,
 and censers of various incenses
perfumed the air around him.

17. 6
There was an entourage of five thousand musicians to the right and left
who played and beat on musical instruments, emitting a beautiful music that
transcended that of the devas and filled the town of Mahāsaṃbhava in order
to bring delight to beings. These ten thousand beings let fall a rain from
clouds of divine flowers. Their bodies surpassed those of devas and humans.
They had the complete bodhisattva motivation and were adorned with
jewelry that surpassed that of the devas.
17. 7
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, approached the householder Vidvān
and, having come up to him, bowed his head to Vidvān’s feet,
circumambulated him, keeping him to his right, many hundreds of
thousands of times, and sat down before him. With his palms together in
homage, Sudhana said, “Ārya, I have set out to attain the highest, complete
enlightenment in order to end the suffering of all beings, [F.12.b] in order to
bring all beings to happiness, in order to save all beings from the ocean of
saṃsāra, in order to take all beings across to the island of the jewels of the
Dharma, in order to dry up the moisture of the cravings of all beings, in order
to create the moisture of compassion in all beings, in order to expel all
delight and craving of desire from all beings, in order to make all beings gain
a craving for the wisdom of buddhahood, in order to make all beings pass
through the jungle of saṃsāra, in order to make all beings develop a delight
and desire for the Dharma and the qualities of the buddhas, in order to make
all beings depart from the city of the three realms, and in order to lead all
beings to the city
 of omniscience.
971
17. 8
“However, I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva
conduct and in what way they should practice it. Ārya, I have heard that you
give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me
how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and how having
trained in it they become supports for all beings!”
17. 9
The householder Vidvān said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
“Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration
for the highest, complete enlightenment!


---

17. 10
“Noble one, it is rare to find a being who develops the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment, who seeks the bodhisattva conduct,
[F.13.a] who never has enough of gazing upon a kalyāṇamitra, who never
tires of coming into the presence of a kalyāṇamitra, who never becomes
dispirited in serving a kalyāṇamitra, who never becomes unhappy with
seeking a kalyāṇamitra, who never turns back from seeking a kalyāṇamitra,
who never ceases to sincerely yearn for and be attracted to a kalyāṇamitra,
who never turns away from gazing upon a kalyāṇamitra, who is never
despondent in following the instructions of a kalyāṇamitra, and who never
wearies of serving and honoring a kalyāṇamitra.
17. 11
“Noble one, do you see those in my entourage?”
Sudhana replied, “Yes, Ārya, I see them.”
17. 12
Vidvān said, “Noble one, I made all of them develop the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment. I have caused them to be reborn in the
family of the tathāgatas. I have nourished them through the accumulation of
the perfections. I have made them practice all the good qualities. I have made
them develop the ten strengths of the tathāgatas. I have made them
transcend the family of the world. I have established them in the family of
the tathāgatas. I have made them turn away from the wheel of worldly
existences. I have made them enter into the turning of the wheel of the
Dharma. I have saved them from falling into lives in the three lower
existences. I have established them in the understanding of the true nature
of phenomena.
“Noble one, it is in that way that bodhisattvas become a refuge for all
beings.
17. 13
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called
 the merit
that arises from the treasury of mind. Through its power I give food to those who
wish for food; drink for those who wish for drink; [F.13.b] excellent flavors to
those who wish for excellent flavors; hard food to those who wish for hard
food; soft food to those who wish for soft food; food that is licked to those
who wish for food that is licked; food that is sucked to those who wish for

“Noble one, stay a moment and you will see a sight.”
17. 14
As soon as the householder Vidvān said those words, at that moment,
having been invited by the householder Vidvān in the prayers he had made
in the past, there came countless beings from different directions, from
different lands, from different districts, from different towns, from different
markets, from different cities, from different villages, from different hamlets,
from different houses, from different castes, from different families, from
different levels of families, from different ways of life, and from different
classifications of stations in life. These beings had various different sensory
perceptions, wishing for various kinds of food, desiring various kinds of
food, with various aspirations, desiring different aspirations and desires,
desiring pure food and drink, desiring meat, wishing to consume contrasting
kinds of different food, and remaining in various kinds of distinct sensory
perceptions and different ways of life. In other words, among humans there
were those who wished for such various kinds of food as boiled rice, sour
gruel, broths, fish, and meat.
17. 15
Whatever were the different kinds of food and drink that were wished for
by those with different ways of life among human beings, through the
power of the bodhisattva, the drumbeat of the unimpeded generosity of the
bodhisattva, and the invitation made by the past prayers of the bodhisattva,
all those human beings came there, and when they had arrived they
entreated the householder Vidvān. They looked upon him, observed him,
and addressed him.
17. 16
The householder Vidvān, knowing that the petitioners had all gathered
there, [F.14.b] thought for a moment and then looked up into the sky. From
the realm of the sky there came into the palms of his hands a great number of
various kinds of food and drink, with various kinds of flavors, various kinds
of colors, and various kinds of aromas. He gave these different kinds of food,


---

drink, and utensils to all the petitioners gathered there, who had different
aspirations and desires, in accordance with what they desired, so that they
were satiated, pleased, contented, delighted, joyful, and overwhelmed with
happiness.
17. 17
Having concluded satisfying them in that way, afterward he taught them
the Dharma. He taught the Dharma that elucidated the cause of gathering a
vast accumulation of wisdom, elucidated the cause that made it impossible
for poverty to occur, elucidated the cause of the arising of perfect great
enjoyment, elucidated the cause of the arising of the attainment of the
Dharma’s way of wisdom, elucidated the cause of the arising of gathering a
vast accumulation of merit, elucidated the cause of the arising of the
attainment of the enjoyment of the food of happiness, elucidated the cause of
the arising of the attainment of a body adorned by the signs and features of a
great being, elucidated the cause of the arising of the attainment of
invincible strength, elucidated the cause of the arising of the attainment of
the unsurpassable
 food of wisdom, and elucidated the cause of the arising
of the attainment of the inexhaustible strength of merit that defeats the
strength
 of all the māras.
976
977
17. 18
When all those who came wishing for food were satisfied through having
obtained various kinds of food from the realm of the sky, the householder
Vidvān taught them the Dharma so that they could attain perfect lifespans,
color, strength, happiness, and eloquence. [F.15.a]
17. 19
When all those who came wishing for drink were satisfied and delighted
through having obtained many kinds of delicious, nontransgressive drinks,
the householder Vidvān taught them the Dharma so that they would turn
away from thirsting for saṃsāra, from delighting in saṃsāra, and would
develop a delight in the Buddhadharma, a thirst
 for the Buddhadharma.
978
17. 20
After all those who came wishing for excellent flavors had been satisfied
by the different excellent flavors of sweetness, sourness, saltiness, spiciness,
bitterness, and astringency, the householder Vidvān taught them the
Dharma so that they would attain the supreme flavor of the physical signs of
a great being.
17. 21
When all those who had come from all directions wishing for carriages
had received the gifts of different kinds of carriages, the householder Vidvān
taught them the Dharma so that they would ride upon the Mahāyāna.
979
17. 22
When those wishing for clothes had come from all directions, the
householder Vidvān, knowing that they had all gathered there, thought for a
moment and then looked up into the sky. From the realm of the sky appeared
many kinds of pure clothes in various colors —blue, yellow, red, white,
madder, and transparent
 —that came into the palms of his hands. When
the householder Vidvān had distributed these to the petitioners, he taught
980


---

them the Dharma so that they would have the pure attainment of a
tathāgata’s unsurpassable sense of shame and conscience that is like the
color of gold.
In that way, the householder Vidvān demonstrated the inconceivable
scope of the bodhisattva liberation.
17. 23
Then he said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, [F.15.b] “I know only
the bodhisattva liberation called the merit that arises from the treasury of the mind.
How could I know the conduct, describe the qualities, or teach the
miraculous powers of the bodhisattvas who have attained the power over
requisites; who have attained jewel-producing hands; who can cover all
world realms without exception with their hands in order to accomplish
various offerings to the buddhas; who can send down rain from clouds of
jewels of various colors upon the circles of the followers of all the tathāgatas;
and similarly can send down rain from clouds of jewelry of various colors,
from clouds of crowns of various colors, from clouds of kūṭāgāras of various
colors, from clouds of clothing of various colors, from clouds of the various
melodious sounds of divine musical instruments being played and beaten
and beautiful songs, from clouds of flowers of various colors, from clouds of
perfumes of various colors, from clouds of incense, garlands, ointments,
powders, Dharma robes, parasols, banners, and flags of various colors, from
clouds of every kind of offering to all the buddhas, and from clouds of all
requisites that fall upon all the circles of followers of the tathāgatas and all
realms of beings in order to honor and make offerings to all the buddhas and
in order to ripen and guide all beings?
17. 24
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called
Siṃhapota, where dwells a head-merchant patron of the Dharma by the
name of Ratnacūḍa. Go to him and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train
in bodhisattva conduct? How should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
17. 25
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was pleased, delighted, enraptured,
overjoyed, and filled with happiness.
 [F.16.a] He demonstrated to the
householder Vidvān the respect of a Dharma pupil. Sudhana viewed him as
someone through whose blessing one can receive all the Buddhadharma,
viewed him as someone through reliance on whom one can attain
omniscience; he demonstrated a continuous delight
 in the kalyāṇamitras;
he had the determination to obey every instruction of the kalyāṇamitras;
being under their power he followed the kalyāṇamitras; he longed to
listen
 to the teachings and words of the kalyāṇamitras; he kept in mind
the power of faith that came from the kalyāṇamitras; he sought the
instructions of the kalyāṇamitras; and he aspired to follow and please the
kalyāṇamitras.

Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of the householder Vidvān,
circumambulated the householder Vidvān, keeping him to his right, many
hundreds of thousands of times, and, looking back again and again,
departed from the householder Vidvān.
