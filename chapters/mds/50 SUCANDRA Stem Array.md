SUCANDRA
50. 1
Sudhana went to the householder Sucandra, bowed his head to the feet of
the householder Sucandra, stood before him, and, with his palms together in
homage, said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it. Ārya, I have
heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that
you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and
how they should practice it!”
50. 2
When he had said that, the householder Sucandra said, “Noble one, I
know the bodhisattva liberation called the stainless light of wisdom.
50. 3
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the stainless light
of wisdom. How could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who have attained countless liberations?
50. 4
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a town called Roruka.
There resides a householder by the name of Ajitasena. Go to him and ask
him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in and practice bodhisattva conduct?’ ”
50. 5

householder Sucandra. He circumambulated the householder Sucandra
many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, [F.278.a]

Sucandra.
