Chapter 43
GOPĀ
43. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, left the presence of Sutejomaṇḍala rati śrī,
the Lumbinī Forest goddess, and went to the location of the great city of
Kapilavastu. [F.219.b]
43. 2
While meditating on, comprehending, increasing, practicing, purifying,
contemplating, and examining the bodhisattva liberation called the miraculous
manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of countless
kalpas, he came to the assembly hall of the bodhisattvas called the
Illuminating Light of the Realm of the Dharma.
1744
43. 3
When he arrived there, he was greeted by Aśokaśrī, the goddess of the
assembly hall of the bodhisattvas, together with ten thousand house
goddesses.
43. 4
She said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “We welcome you, great
being who has the prowess of great wisdom and knowledge; whose mind
has attained the meditation of inconceivable bodhisattva liberation; whose
field of activity is the vast divine palace of the Dharma; who enters the city of
the Dharma; who is continuously engaged in guiding beings through
infinite bodhisattva methods; who has attained the illumination of the ocean
of qualities of the tathāgatas; who has the manifest knowledge and
illuminating eloquence for guiding all beings; who has the motivation to
manifest the conduct of
 a corresponding body and language
 that
knows the conduct of all beings; who prays to increase the power of an
ocean of joy in the minds of all beings; and who follows the path to the
comprehension of the Dharma of all the tathāgatas.
1745
1746
43. 5
“I see that you have the field of activity of profound behavior with a
steady
 gaze, [F.220.a] and that therefore you are someone who will soon
attain the unsurpassable pure adornments of the body, speech, and mind of
1747


---

the tathāgatas and will act in this world with a body adorned by the signs
and features of a great being and with a mind adorned by the light of
knowledge of the ten strengths.
43. 6
“I see that you have diligence and prowess, and that therefore you are
someone who soon will have the vision of the tathāgatas of the three times;
will hold the clouds of Dharmas of all the tathāgatas; will experience the joy
of the divine palace of the four qualities of bodhisattva dhyānas, liberations,
samādhis, and samāpattis; and will enter the profound liberation of the
buddhas.
43. 7
“In that way, you go before kalyāṇamitras, gaze upon them, honor them,
receive their teaching without error, and are dedicated to the practice of its
qualities that is unwearied, irreversible, and never disheartened. You are
unaffected by any hindrance, obstacle, or obscuration whatsoever. Neither
Māra nor the māra class of deities are present before you, and therefore you
will soon bring happiness to all beings.”
43. 8
The head merchant’s son, Sudhana, said to Aśokaśrī, the goddess of the
assembly hall of the bodhisattvas, “Goddess, I gain the highest delight in
ending the torment of the kleśas for all beings. I gain the highest delight in
repelling dreadful
 karma for all beings, [F.220.b] in bringing happiness to
all beings, and in making all beings practice faultless actions. Bodhisattvas
become very unhappy when beings engage in the unhappiness of various
kinds of karma and kleśas, which disturbs their minds and causes them to
fall into the lower existences. Even if those beings remain in happier
existences, they experience physical and mental sufferings and various
kinds of unhappiness and remain in a state of sorrow.
1748
43. 9
“Goddess, it is like if a very loving father who has a beloved, beautiful son
sees the limbs and smaller parts of his son’s body being cut off. Because he is
so loving, he becomes extremely unhappy and sorrowful.
43. 10
“Goddess, in the same way, when a bodhisattva who is engaged in
bodhisattva conduct sees beings falling into the three lower existences
through the power of their karma and kleśas, the bodhisattva becomes
extremely unhappy and sorrowful.
43. 11
“The bodhisattvas are happy, glad, joyful, delighted, and pleased when
beings are reborn into happy existences when their bodies are destroyed, or
when they experience physical and mental happiness in a divine or human
existence as the result of their having adopted good physical, vocal, and
mental conduct.
43. 12
“Goddess, the bodhisattvas do not aspire to and are not dedicated to
omniscience for their own sake or in order to experience the various joys and
pleasures of saṃsāra. [F.221.a] It is not from dedication to the various
different kinds of joys within the desire realm. It is not through the power of


---

mistaken perception, motivation, or views. It is not through the power of
involvement, bondage, predispositions, or being overwhelmed. It is not
through the power of the view of craving. It is not through the increase of a
mind that conceives of the joys of crowds and the gatherings of various
beings. It is not through attachment to the experiences of the joy and bliss of
dhyāna. It is not going around and around in the continuity of saṃsāra
while being obscured by various obscurations.
43. 13
“Goddess, the bodhisattvas have great compassion for beings who are in
the ocean of saṃsāra and who are tormented by immeasurable sufferings.
They make great prayers to gather to themselves all beings. Through the
power of having made those prayers with great compassion, they are
dedicated to ripening and guiding beings, and they appear carrying out
bodhisattva conduct in saṃsāra. In order to eliminate all the obscurations of
beings, they seek the unobscured wisdom of omniscience and make prayers
to serve and make offerings to all the tathāgatas. Through the power of their
prayers to serve and make offerings to all the tathāgatas, they are never
disheartened in their practice of bodhisattva conduct. When they are
practicing bodhisattva conduct and see a realm that is completely defiled,
they make the prayer to purify all buddha realms. When they are purifying
defiled realms [F.221.b] and see the various āyatanas of all beings, they make
the prayer to purify the Dharma body that is undifferentiated and
unsurpassable. When they see the defiled bodies, speech, and minds of
beings, they make the prayer to purify the bodies, speech, and minds that
adorn all beings. When they see the incomplete āyatanas and impure minds
of beings, they purify the minds and conduct of all beings and are never
disheartened in carrying out bodhisattva conduct.
43. 14
“Goddess, in that way, with minds that are never disheartened, the
bodhisattvas carry out vast bodhisattva conduct without end or middle. With
that kind of conduct they are adornments of the world because they create
the good fortune of devas and humans. They are like parents because they
establish beings in the aspiration for enlightenment. They are like nurses
because they bring beings onto the bodhisattva path. They are like connate
deities, who are deities that always accompany a being because they protect
beings from the terror of the abyss of the lower existences. They are like
great ferrymen because they free beings from the ocean of saṃsāra. They are
refuges because they repel all the terrors of the māras and kleśas. They are
shelters because they bring beings to a state of complete tranquility.
 They
are bathing places because they bring beings into the ocean of all buddhas.
They are protectors because they escort beings to the island of the jewels of
the Dharma. They are flowers because their minds have blossomed with all
the qualities of buddhahood. They are adornments because they radiate the
1749


---

light of merit and wisdom. [F.222.a] They bring the highest delight and
happiness because they are beautiful. They are excellent to meet because
they are dedicated to faultless actions. They are completely good because
they possess bodies that are complete in having all aspects of excellent
limbs. They have charming forms because the sight of them is without
anything disagreeable. They bring light because they radiate the light rays of
wisdom. They bring illumination because they hold the torch of the Dharma.
They bring clarity because they purify the motivation for enlightenment.
They are generals because they repel the activities of the māras. They are
suns because they radiate a net of the light rays of wisdom. They are moons
because they rise as moons of realization in the sky of the Dharma.
 They
are clouds because they send down rain from great clouds of Dharma onto
all beings.
1750
“Goddess, the bodhisattvas who practice in that way are a delight for all
beings.”
43. 15
Then Aśokaśrī, the goddess of the assembly hall of the bodhisattvas,
together with ten thousand goddesses of the home, sent down onto
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, a rain of flowers, garlands, incense,
powders, ointments, and precious jewelry that transcended divine materials.
Encircling him and following him as he entered the assembly hall of the
bodhisattvas, they praised him with these verses:
43. 16
“Having developed the aspiration for enlightenment
Out of love for all beings,
The jinas, the suns of wisdom,
Sometimes appear in the world. {1}
43. 17
“Even in many millions
 of kalpas [F.222.b]
1751
It is difficult to see your face.
Your wisdom is a great sun
In the world blinded by ignorance. {2}
43. 18
“Great compassion arose in you
When you saw the world in error,
Obscured by the darkness of unknowing,
And you spontaneously appeared in it and remained. {3}
43. 19
“With your pure motivation, you are dedicated
To attaining the enlightenment of buddhahood.
You serve and depend on kalyāṇamitras
Without regard for your own body and life. {4}
43. 20
“You have no reliance on this world.


---

You have no location and no preoccupations.
You have no entanglements and no abode.
Your motivation is like space, without impediment. {5}
43. 21
“As you practice bodhisattva conduct
With the brilliant light of a field of merit,
Your radiant torch of wisdom
Shines within countless worlds. {6}
43. 22
“You are not above the world,
But you are unstained by worldly qualities.
You act in the world without impediment,
Like the breezes moving through the sky. {7}
43. 23
“You are dedicated to constantly blazing
Like the burning at the kalpa’s end.
You practice the bodhisattva conduct
With the ardor of the fire that ends a kalpa. {8}
43. 24
“You have great courage, like a lion.
With strong, diligent prowess
You have attained the prowess of wisdom
With a practice that is invincible. {9}
43. 25
“Through honoring the kalyāṇamitras,
You, here, have entered into
The ocean of all the different ways
Within the ocean of the realm of the Dharma.” {10}
43. 26
In that way, Aśokaśrī, the goddess of the assembly hall of the bodhisattvas,
praised in verse Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, while following him out
of a yearning for the Dharma.
43. 27
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, went into the assembly hall of the
bodhisattvas called the Illuminating Light of the Realm of the Dharma.
[F.223.a] When he had entered, wishing to find the Śākya maiden Gopā, he
looked everywhere.
43. 28
He saw the Śākya maiden Gopā in the center of the assembly hall of the
bodhisattvas called the Illuminating Light of the Realm of the Dharma. She
was seated upon a precious throne that had in its center a lotus with a form
that illuminated all the abodes of bodhisattvas, and she was encircled by an
entourage of eighty-four thousand women of royal families, who all had
equally the roots of merit from the past practice of bodhisattva conduct; who
in the past had attracted gatherings of beings through acts of generosity;
who had a way of speaking with pleasant and gentle words; who cared for


---

beings through causing them to focus on the goal of omniscience; who cared
for beings in accord with the realizations of the buddhas and the
bodhisattvas; who with all actions inspired by great compassion cared for
beings as if they were their sons and daughters; who with great love
followed and purified their spouses; and who in the past ripened beings
through the inconceivable skillful methods of bodhisattvas.
43. 29
Those eighty-four thousand women followed the way of the perfections of
bodhisattvas who were progressing irreversibly toward the highest,
complete enlightenment. They followed the bodhisattva training without
expectation of reward from others. They had minds free from all attachment.
They were disillusioned by all the delights of saṃsāra. They had purified
without impediment all the ways in the realm of the Dharma. They had the
power of the motivation directed toward omniscience. They were free from
the net of obscurations and obstacles. [F.223.b] They had transcended all the
paths of attachment. They were active through emanations of their Dharma
bodies. They were focused on ripening and guiding all worlds. They had
minds in which a stainless ocean of merit had arisen. They had become what
they were because of their completely good bodhisattva prayers and
conduct. They had increased the vast power of the strengths of bodhisattvas.
And their minds had become illuminating like the disk of the sun.
43. 30
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the Śākya
maiden and then stood before her, his hands placed together in homage, and
said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the highest, complete
enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas continue within
saṃsāra without being stained by saṃsāra; how they realize the equal
nature of all phenomena but do not dwell on the level of the śrāvakas and
pratyeka buddhas; how they attain the illumination of the Dharma of the
buddhas and yet continue with their bodhisattva conduct; how they dwell
on the level of a bodhisattva but teach the scope of knowledge of the
tathāgatas; how they transcend all worldly existences but are active within
all worldly existences; how they accomplish a body of the Dharma but also
accomplish form bodies of infinite colors; how they attain the Dharma body
that has no characteristics but manifest bodies with the colors and shapes of
all beings; and how they realize that all Dharmas cannot be described but
teach the Dharma to all beings, describing them with all ways of speaking
and definitions. [F.224.a] They know that all beings
 are without existence,
but they do not turn away from the ways of guiding the realm of beings; they
comprehend that all phenomena are unborn and unceasing, but they do not
abandon engaging in making offerings to and venerating all the tathāgatas;
and they realize that there is no karma and ripening within all phenomena,
but they do not turn away from engagement in accomplishing good actions.”
1752

43. 31
Gopā, the Śākya maiden, said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
“Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you intended to ask in that way
about the nature of bodhisattva conduct. Those questions are also the words
of the completely good prayer and conduct.
“Therefore, noble one, listen carefully and remember, for I shall teach
through the blessing of the Buddha.
43. 32
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who have ten qualities such as these fulfill
the bodhisattva conduct that is like the appearance of magical illusions and
gives rise to the light of wisdom.
43. 33
“What are these ten? They are (1) reliance on sublime kalyāṇamitras, (2)
the attainment of a vast aspiration, (3) a pure, sublime virtuous motivation,
(4) a mind supported by a vast ocean of merit and wisdom, (5) being able to
hear great teachings of the Dharma that has originated and arisen from the
buddhas, [F.224.b] (6) the attainment of aspiration toward the tathāgatas of
the three times, (7) the comprehension of the equality of all the fields of
bodhisattva conduct, (8) the attainment of the blessing of all the tathāgatas,
(9) the natural, pure, higher motivation of great compassion, and (10) that
attainment of the strong power of the motivation to end the continuation of
all the cycles of saṃsāra.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who have those ten qualities fulfill the
bodhisattva conduct that is like the appearance of magical illusions and
gives rise to the light of wisdom.1753
43. 34
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas with nonregressing diligence who have
obtained those ten qualities, in order to accomplish an inexhaustible way
and practice an extremely vast meditation, serve the kalyāṇamitras and
please them in ten ways.
43. 35
“What are those ten ways? They are (1) having no concern for one’s own
life and body, (2) having no interest in the requisites of saṃsāra, (3) having
the comprehension of the equality of all phenomena, (4) having an
irrevocable prayer for omniscience, (5) observing all the ways of the realm of
the Dharma, (6) having a mind that rises above the entire ocean of existences,
(7) having no dependence or location within the space of the locationless
Dharma, (8) having all the unobscured prayers of a bodhisattva, (9)
pervading the entire ocean of realms, and (10) having the purified
unobscured field of the knowledge of a bodhisattva.
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who have those ten qualities serve and
please the kalyāṇamitras.” [F.225.a]
43. 36
Then the Śākya maiden Gopā, in order to teach the meaning of that,
through the blessing of the buddhas looked into the ten directions and
recited these verses:
43. 37
“Those sublime, stainless, wise ones engaged in benefiting others,


---

Dedicated without deceit or deception to serving excellent friends,
Recognizing them as teachers and having unflagging diligence —
They carry out in the world this conduct that is like a magical apparition. {11}
43. 38
“There are those who have sublime motivation as vast as space
Within whom is contained the worlds of the three times,
Realms, beings, phenomena, and likewise the buddhas.
This is the conduct of those who shine with wisdom. {12}
43. 39
“There are those whose motivation is like space, without end or middle,
Who are completely pure, unstained by the kleśas,
And who give rise to the qualities of all the tathāgatas.
Their conduct is like the appearance of magical apparitions. {13}
43. 40
“There are those who have clear minds and an ocean of qualities
And are established in vast, limitless, inconceivable, omniscient wisdom.
They have bodies that have an ocean of merit and a pure essence
That is unstained by worldly impurities even though they act within the
world. {14}
43. 41
“There are those who never have enough of listening to the thunder of the
Dharma
That has the aspects of the speech of the jinas and all the ways of languages
And who are lamps of the light of wisdom, which follow the way of the
Dharma.
This is the conduct of those who bring illumination to beings. {15}
43. 42
“There are those who comprehend in each instant of the mind
Each one of the countless tathāgatas in the ten directions,
And they see and know the entire ocean of sugatas.
This is the conduct of those who keep the buddhas in mind. {16}
43. 43
“There are those who see the vast assemblies of followers of the jinas
And who comprehend the ocean of their ways of samādhi
And the ways of their vast ocean of prayers with no end or middle. [F.225.b]
This conduct of theirs is like the appearance of illusions. {17}
43. 44
“There are those who have been blessed by every jina in the ten directions,
Who have the completely good conduct till the final kalpa,
And whose images appear throughout the vast extent of the realms.
This is the conduct of those who bring the light of the Dharma. {18}
43. 45
“There are those who have the disk of the sun of compassion,
Who, seeing beings in distress, illuminate them with the Dharma’s light,


---

Clear away the darkness of beings, and cause the teachings to shine.
This is the conduct of those who are like the sun. {19}
43. 46
“There are those who see beings circling through existences,
And those clear-minded ones remain, countering saṃsāra’s flow,
And everywhere they bring about the wheel of the Dharma.
They are practicing the wise, supreme, completely good conduct. {20}
43. 47
“There are those who, training in this, manifest to beings,
In accord with aspirations, bodies without limit or middle,
Their countless bodies being like reflections or mirages,
And they ripen many beings within the ocean of existences. {21}
43. 48
“There are those who are spreading among beings through the vast ways of
love,
Manifesting conducts to beings with various dispositions,
And sending down a rain of Dharma in accordance with the aspirations of
beings.
Those resolute ones guide billions of beings toward enlightenment.” {22}
43. 49
Those are the verses that Gopā, the Śākya maiden, recited. She then said to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, I have attained the
bodhisattva liberation called the range of the view of all the ways of the ocean of the
samādhis of the bodhisattvas.”
43. 50
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what is this bodhisattva liberation called the range of
the view of all the ways of the ocean of the samādhis of the bodhisattvas like?”
Gopā answered, “Noble one, when I rest within this bodhisattva
liberation, [F.226.a] I see and comprehend as many kalpas in this world realm
as there are atoms in countless buddha realms. I know all the existences of
beings who are within that kalpa. I also know all the gateways into death
and rebirth of those beings. I know all their entrances into becoming, all their
acquisition of created karma, and all the various ripenings of their karma. I
know all the karma acquired through good actions. I know all the karma that
is bad, that brings emancipation, that does not bring emancipation, that is
definite, and that is indefinite; I know the definitely false, the latent, the
nonlatent, the perfection of roots of merit, the loss of roots of merit, the
retention of roots of merit, the retention of roots of demerit, the retention of
roots of merit and demerit, the acquisition of good qualities, and the
acquisition of bad qualities.
43. 51
“I know and comprehend all the buddha bhagavats that appear in those
kalpas as numerous as the atoms in countless buddha realms. I know and
comprehend the ocean of their names. I know the ocean of the first
developments of the aspiration to enlightenment by those buddha
