1761

“In the same way that I realize, know, and comprehend the ocean of the
Bhagavat Vairocana’s buddha and bodhisattva conduct throughout the
entire realm of phenomena, I also realize, know, and comprehend the ocean
of buddha and bodhisattva conduct of all the tathāgatas and their entry into

43. 62
“Why is that? Noble one, it is because this purview is that of the
bodhisattva liberation called the range of the view of all the ways of the ocean of the
samādhis of the bodhisattvas. When I am resting in that, I know the minds and
conduct of all beings.
43. 63
“I know the accumulation of good actions of all beings. I know the
defilement and the purification of all beings. I know the various kinds of
karma of all beings. I know the entrances to samādhi of all śrāvakas. I know
the levels of samādhi of all śrāvakas. I know and comprehend the miraculous

the ways of the ocean of the liberations of all bodhisattvas. I know the entry
into the ocean of the liberations of all the tathāgatas.”
43. 64
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, asked the Śākya maiden Gopā,
“Āryā, how long has it been since you attained this bodhisattva liberation
called the range of the view of all the ways of the ocean of the samādhis of the
bodhisattvas?”
She answered, “Noble one, in the past, in times gone by, beyond as many
kalpas as there are atoms in a hundred buddha realms, there was a world
realm called Abhayaṃkarā. In that world there was a kalpa called
Gatipravara. In the center of that world realm there was a four-continent
world called Kṣemāvatī. In the center of the Jambudvīpa of that four-
continent world there was the royal capital called Druma meru śrī, the
principal city from among eighty-four thousand
 cities. In the royal capital
Druma meru śrī and each of the eighty-four thousand towns, the ground was
made of blue beryl. Walls made of the seven precious materials encircled
them. And they were each encircled by seven moats that were filled with
scented water and had bottoms covered in gold dust and surfaces covered
with blue lotuses, red lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses that were the
size of wagon wheels, shone with light rays of various colors, and had all-
pervading lovely aromas. There were rows of seven promenades made of the
seven precious materials and seven rows of palm trees. [F.231.b] They were
encircled by seven successive planted forests of trees made of the seven
precious materials. Above there was a canopy of a net of gold.
 The
ground was beautifully adorned by various jewels arranged in checkerboard
patterns.
 Groups of siddhas wandered around. From flocks of noble birds
came the beautiful sound of their melodious songs. The towns were
beautified by a trillion parks. They had abundant good fortune, and they
were filled with crowds of hundreds of thousands of joyful men and women.
Pleasant, delightful breezes blew, and rains of many flowers continuously
fell. A hundred thousand kings dwelled among them. When all the precious
trees, adornments of gold, and so on in the great towns were moved by the

wind, there came from them the many sounds of music, and harmonious
voices arose saying these happy words: ‘Bathe! Drink! Eat! Practice the
Dharma! Develop the aspiration for enlightenment! Attain the power of the
level of irreversibility! Be happy!’
1765
43. 65
“In the royal city of Druma meru śrī there was the king of the realm whose
name was Dhanapati. He had a harem of eighty-four thousand queens and
five hundred ministers. King Dhanapati had five hundred sons, and they
were all courageous and heroic, with perfect bodies, victorious over
opponents, handsome, attractive, and with a magnificent, supreme, beautiful
color. [F.232.a]
43. 66
“King Dhanapati’s principal queen was Padma śrī garbha saṃbhavā, who
was the foremost among the eighty-four thousand wives. Her son was
Tejodhipati. He had an excellent body and was handsome and attractive. He
was beautified by the thirty-two physical signs of a great being in the
following way:
43. 67
1. “The soles of Prince Tejodhipati’s feet were well placed. When he took
steps on the great earth, he stepped evenly. When he raised a foot, it was
raised evenly, and when he placed his foot down, the entire sole of the foot
touched the great earth evenly.
43. 68
2. “On the soles of his feet and the palms of his hands there was a
thousand-spoked wheel, with hubs and rims, complete in all aspects,
beautiful, and attractive.
43. 69
3. “The upper part of both his feet
 was very prominent: the upper
surface of his feet had a clear and very beautiful color, a color better and
brighter than excellent flowers.
1766
43. 70
4. “His toes and fingers were connected by a web: they were very
beautiful, distinct, and with no holes or suppurations, like those of
Dhṛtarāṣṭra, the king of geese.
43. 71
5. His heels were wide: they were pure, bright, and shining with the lights
of all jewels.
43. 72
6. His toes and fingers were long: they were rounded, with evenly spaced
joints and wide, and the toes came down evenly onto the ground and lifted
off evenly from the ground. [F.232.b]
43. 73
7. The soles of his feet and the palms of his hands were more pleasant to
the touch than down. Whether it was a man or a woman, a boy or a girl who
touched them, they were delighted and were made content and happy by
perfect bliss.
43. 74
8. “His calves were like those of the female blackbuck, gradually tapering,
very beautiful and well formed. Like the female blackbuck, monarch among
deer, no one could run after him and catch him, and he never became tired
and fatigued when running.


---

43. 75
9. “The young prince Tejodhipati had the seven prominences. These seven
were his two feet, which were prominent, rounded, excellent, wide, with
joints not visible, beautiful, and attractive, and similarly his two hands, his
two shoulders, and the nape of his neck.
43. 76
10. “His penis was retracted into his body: As his penis was retracted into
his body, it was not visible but completely hidden and obscured, like that of
an elephant or a stallion. Therefore, it was unstained and could not be seen
by a woman or a man, a boy or a girl, someone who was old, middle-aged, or
young,
 or a guru or a guru’s disciple,
 unless he was using it or wished
to show it or was having sexual intercourse.
1767
1768
43. 77
11. “The young prince Tejodhipati’s torso was like that of a lion: his body
gradually widened so that his torso was broad and perfect, more beautiful
and excellently shaped than that of the king of the animals. [F.233.a]
43. 78
12. “He had wide shoulders: he had a very broad body, a perfectly
proportional body, a perfectly symmetrical body, a body that was not too
bulky, a body that was not too thin, a body that was not feeble,
 a body
that was not stooped, and a body that shone brighter than a polished slab of
jewels.
1769
43. 79
13. “He had large shoulders: his shoulders were muscular, and his
arms
 beautifully filled out.
1770
43. 80
14. “He had also attained the sign of a great being of his arms being very
long: even without bending, while standing up straight, his hands could
touch and rub his kneecaps.
43. 81
15. “He had also attained the sign of a great being of his body being tall
and straight. It was perfect in all its aspects and was properly formed. His
body was supple.
 His body was very heavy. His body was very bright.
His body was very pleasing to the eyes.
1771
43. 82
16. “He had also attained the sign of a great being’s conch-like throat. His
neck was not short. All the channels of taste
 in the area of the throat and
the area of the mouth were balanced and complete.
1772
43. 83
17. “He had also attained the sign of a great being’s lion-like cheeks and
jaws. His jaws were very firm. His face was very wide, his face was excellent
and pure, and his mouth was wide.
43. 84
18. “He also possessed the sign of a great being’s forty even teeth. There
were no missing teeth. When he ate food, with one chew there was no food
that remained unmasticated, not even a single grain of rice.
43. 85
19. “He had attained even, gapless rows of teeth: there were no gaps, and
they remained perfectly even and constantly beautiful, whatever occurred.
The food he ate would not discolor his teeth,
 stick to his teeth, adhere to
his teeth, [F.233.b] cause his teeth to rot, cause abscesses,
 or get stuck
between his teeth.
1773
1774

43. 86
20. “He had also attained the great being’s sign of even teeth: his teeth
were even and not irregular, there was no deficiency in teeth, no extra teeth,
no taller teeth, no smaller teeth, and no compacted teeth; the teeth were
equal in height and breadth, and there were no broken teeth.
43. 87
21. “The youth’s eyeteeth were very white: his eyeteeth were without
defects, his eyeteeth were bright, his eyeteeth were pure, and his eyeteeth
were strong.
43. 88
22. “He had also attained the great being’s sign of a wide tongue: his
tongue was wide, fine, very smooth, flexible, beautiful, versatile, could cover
his entire face, and spoke without impediment true and beneficial meanings,
consonants, words, and definitions.
43. 89
23. “The prince had the voice of Brahmā: he had a beautiful voice that
spoke with an activity of speech that had all the beautiful sounds of
drumming, songs, musical instruments, speech, and conversation, which
brought joy and inspired the world. He had a voice that was superior even to
Brahmā’s, yet it was not beyond and inaccessible to his circle of followers but
harmonized with everyone’s minds.
43. 90
24. “The prince had distinctly deep black
 eyes: he had clear eyes, pure
eyes, bright eyes, serene
 eyes, beautiful eyes, delightful eyes, attractive
eyes, and smiling eyes.
1776
1777
43. 91
25. “The prince had eyelashes like a cow’s eyelashes: [F.234.a] he had
sensory faculties of the eyes that were like pure ruby jewels, sameness of the
whites of the eyes, identical whites of the eyes, excellent whites of the eyes,
wide whites of the eyes, complete whites of the eyes, and constant whites of
the eyes.
43. 92
26. “In between his eyebrows an ūrṇā hair had grown: it was soft and
pliable, delicate, as pleasant to the touch as cotton wool, clear, bright, the
color of snow, and like ice, and it had the shining light of a halo of white
light rays.
43. 93
27. “There was an uṣṇīṣa formed on the crown of his head: it was well
formed, perfectly round, central, an adornment of the hair, resembling a
precious lotus with a trillion petals, perfectly symmetrical, and cherished as a
priceless crest adornment.
43. 94
28. “The prince had very smooth skin: his body was free of dust, stains,
sweat, cracks, wrinkles, flabbiness, shriveling, sagging, and looseness.1778
43. 95
29. “The prince was golden in color: he was the color of Jambu River gold,
had a halo a fathom wide, and was beautifully adorned by a halo of light that
shone like gold.
43. 96
30. “That youth had arising from each pore a darkness-dispelling
brightness of aromatic light rays that arose from all his pores and adorned
his body: from each pore grew perfectly a body hair that was the color of

blue beryl and curled to the right, peacefully present on the body, perfectly
arranged, perfectly present, perfectly established. The youth’s body hairs
curled upward; [F.234.b] his body hairs did not turn downward, his body
hairs were irreversible, and his body hairs were unmixed.
43. 97
31. “The youth had attained the great being’s sign of having hair the color
of blue sapphire:
 his hair was deep blue like the color of a shining blue
precious jewel. It was soft, shiny, perfectly curving, curling to the right, and
with good roots; it did not stand up, never tangled, was never in disarray,
and always remained with the same even appearance.
1779
1780
43. 98
32. “The young prince had attained the great being’s sign of being like the
overspreading width of a banyan tree: he was perfectly upright, completely
good, and utterly beautiful. He was a lovely sight, and one could never have
enough of gazing upon him. Whether from the back, the left, or the right;
whether he was walking, sitting, standing, or lying down; whether he was
talking or silent, he was a lovely sight, and one could never have enough of
gazing upon him.
43. 99
“Noble one, Prince Tejodhipati had a body completely adorned by these
thirty-two signs of a great being.
43. 100
“Noble one, he was a sight that was comforting to all beings, he was a
sight that fulfilled all intentions, and he was a sight that brought delight to
all beings. This was how he had been born.
43. 101
“Noble one, at one time,
 Prince Tejodhipati, having obtained
permission from his father, was going, accompanied by twenty thousand
maidens, to the park of the royal capital of Druma meru śrī, which was called
Gandhāṅkura prabha megha, in order to see that good place. He delighted a
crowd of men and women with the display of the miraculous manifestations
from the splendor of his merit and his glorious good fortune.
1781
43. 102
“He mounted a chariot made of Jambu River gold. [F.235.a] It had four
great wheels of precious diamonds. It had an axle that was a powerful vajra.
Its excellent shafts were made from the best sandalwood. It had well-
arranged poles made of a variety of perfumed kings of jewels. It was
decorated by a variety of flowers made from all jewels. It was covered by
nets of strings of all jewels. In its center was a precious lion throne on which
was a display of a network
 of sublime jewels. Five hundred maidens held
its tasseled cords. Yoked to the carriage were a thousand thoroughbred
stallions that could run as fast as the wind moves freely through the air. It
had a succession of beautiful great parasols.
 It had an awning made from
white beryl kings of jewels. It shone with pure immeasurable light. It was
beautified by the adornment of the entire variety of inconceivable, wonderful
jewels. It was adorned with every kind of beauty. It had a great precious
parasol
 that was held aloft by a pole of blue beryls, the kings of jewels. It

was encircled by many hundreds of thousands of beings. The beautiful,
melodious sound of music arose from hundreds of thousands of musical
instruments. A great rain of flowers fell. A divine, beautiful aroma spread
from a quintillion censers. That was the way he went to the park.
43. 103
“As he proceeded, at that time, the road became eight vehicles wide,
without any unevenness, and without pebbles or gravel. The ground was
made from the elements of gold, silver, and the various kinds of jewels. It
was bestrewn with gold dust. It was covered with the scattered petals of
flowers made of every kind of jewel. On both sides were rows of jewel trees
on bases made of all kinds of jewels. Above there was a network of strings of
precious bells and jingle bells. It was covered by a variety of precious
canopies. It was perfectly adorned by a beautiful display of countless
hundreds of thousands of erected precious banners, flags, and hanging
streamers. [F.235.b]
43. 104
“On both sides, it was adorned by an arrangement of rows of precious
platforms.
“On some platforms, a variety of precious bowls filled with a variety of
jewels had been arranged for the crowds of petitioners.
43. 105
“On some platforms, all kinds of precious adornments had been placed for
those who requested adornments.
“On some platforms, wish-fulfilling jewels had been set out in order to
fulfill the wishes of all beings.
43. 106
“On some platforms, many vessels containing food and drink with flavors
of various kinds had been set out so as to provide whatever was desired.
“On some platforms, divine food with the most perfect flavors, colors,
aromas, tastes, and pleasant textures had been provided.
43. 107
“On some platforms, divine fruits of every kind with a variety of flavors
had been heaped up.
“On some platforms were set out trillions of divine, precious clothes for
those who desired clothes to enjoy in accordance with their wishes. They
were not woven on a loom, had various kinds of beauty and all kinds of
excellent colors, were adorned with various designs, and were very noble,
worthy, fine, and perfectly smooth.
43. 108
“On some platforms were arranged all kinds of divine aromatic
substances, with various colors and aromas, for those who wished to
perfume themselves to enjoy in accordance with their wishes.
“On some platforms, heaps of various artifacts had been arranged for
beings to enjoy in accordance with their wishes.
43. 109
“On some platforms were arranged beautiful, charming, attractive women
with a variety of pleasing appearances, their bodies beautified by being
dressed in a variety of beautiful clothes, [F.236.a] beautifully adorned by


---

every kind of jewelry, perfumed by a variety of scents, and skilled in the
female crafts and arts.
43. 110
“At that time, in the royal capital Druma meru śrī, there was the preeminent
courtesan
 called Sudarśanā, who was worthy to be enjoyed by the king.
She had a daughter named Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī, who was beautiful, with
a lovely body, attractive, not too tall and not too short, not too plump and not
too thin, not too white and not too dark, and with deep black hair, deep black
eyes, a beautiful face, and a voice like Brahmā’s; who spoke gently and
pleasantly, was wise, and was skilled in all the arts; and who knew all
treatises, was diligent, was not lazy, was respectful, was gracious, had a kind
mind, was not aggressive, was so attractive that one never tired of gazing
upon her, had little desire, anger, or ignorance, had a sense of decorum and
modesty, was honest and gentle, and had no deceit or trickery.
1785
43. 111
“She mounted a precious carriage with her mother and accompanied by
many girls, and they came out from Druma meru śrī. At the king’s command,
they sought out the young prince Tejodhipati so as to sing before him.
43. 112
“When Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī saw Prince Tejodhipati, her mind was
shaken by overwhelming desire. The beauty of Prince Tejodhipati was so
great she helplessly followed him.
43. 113
“She said to her mother Sudarśanā, ‘Mother, know this: I will die if I am
not given to this Prince Tejodhipati! [F.236.b] The suffering will bring me to
death!’
Sudarśanā replied, ‘My daughter, don’t have such an aspiration! This
youth has the signs of a cakravartin. When his father Dhanapati is no longer
with us, he will rule a cakravartin’s kingdom. When he has become a
cakravartin, he will have a precious queen who will come flying through the
air. My daughter, we are courtesans who bring pleasure to the entire world.
We do not and cannot remain throughout our lifetime serving only one
being. King Dhanapati commanded us to come before the young prince
Tejodhipati only to show our respect! That kind of status would be too
difficult to attain.’
43. 114
“At that time, in that world there appeared a tathāgata, an arhat, a samyak-
saṃbuddha, one with wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who knows the
world’s beings, an unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a teacher of
devas and humans, a buddha, a bhagavat, who was named Sūrya gātra-
pravara.
1786
43. 115
“His bodhimaṇḍa, called Dharma meghodgata prabhā, was near to the
Gandhāṅkura prabha megha Park. It had been seven days since the
Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara had attained complete
buddhahood there. The girl, while in her carriage, nodded off to sleep and
saw him in a dream. When she woke up, a goddess, who in past times had


---

been a relative, declared to her, ‘Girl, the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara is
present in the Dharma meghodgata prabhā bodhimaṇḍa, after his first seven
days since attaining complete buddhahood. [F.237.a] He is encircled by an
assembly of bodhisattvas, and before him are gathered assemblies of devas,
nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas,
Brahmakāyika deities, Ābhāsvara deities, and Akaniṣṭha deities. Also
gathered there to gaze upon the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara are all
goddesses of the earth, goddesses of water, goddesses of fire, goddesses of
the air, goddesses of the oceans, goddesses of the rivers, goddesses of the
mountains, goddesses of the night, goddesses of the dawn, goddesses of the
forests, goddesses of the trees, goddesses of herbs, goddesses of harvests,
goddesses 
of 
towns, 
goddesses 
of 
footpaths, 
goddesses 
of 
the
bodhimaṇḍas, goddesses of the body’s light rays, goddesses of classes of
beings, goddesses of the sky, and goddesses from all directions.’
43. 116
“When Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī had seen the Tathāgata and heard of the
qualities of the Tathāgata, she attained a state of serenity. When the
opportunity came, she recited these verses before Prince Tejodhipati:
43. 117
“ ‘I am preeminent in this world because of my excellent body.
My qualities are renowned in all directions.
Because of the power of my wisdom, there is no one like me.
I am learned in all the arts and skills of pleasure. {1}
43. 118
“ ‘There are many thousands of beings
Who gaze upon me with desire.
Prince, I have had no desire within me
For anyone in this world. {2}
43. 119
“ ‘I have no attachment toward any being.
In my mind there is no anger toward anyone.
No one is my enemy, and I have no hatred.
In my mind there is only delight in benefiting
 beings. {3}
1787
43. 120
“ ‘When, Prince,
 I clearly saw [F.237.b]
1788
You who have a supreme body with excellent qualities,
All my senses experienced bliss.
There arose within me a vast, great bliss. {4}
43. 121
“ ‘Your coiled hair upon your excellent head
Is deep blue like the color of a shining jewel.
You have lovely eyebrows and a beautiful nose.
In your presence I offer you my body. {5}
43. 122
“ ‘You have the supreme signs; you have excellent radiance.


---

Your body is like an excellent mountain of gold.
In your presence, compared to you I have no beauty;
I am outshone and resemble a solid lump of ink. {6}
43. 123
“ ‘Your clear eyes are long, with contrasting white and black.
You have a wide face and the cheeks and jaws of a lion.
Your speech is free of any impediment.
I pray that you, who have the supreme speech, take me. {7}
43. 124
“ ‘You have a wide tongue within your mouth.
It is wide and red, with the excellent light of a jewel.
You possess speech with the supreme aspects of Brahmā’s voice.
When you speak, you bring delight to beings. {8}
43. 125
“ ‘You have even rows of teeth in your mouth,
Very bright and stainless, like conches.
When you show them in smiling or talking,
You, glorious man, bring joy to beings. {9}
43. 126
“ ‘Your body is beautified by the thirty-two
Supreme signs, and it shines brightly.
As your body is adorned by those signs,
Lord of humans, you will be a cakravartin.’
 {10}
1789
43. 127
“Then Prince Tejodhipati asked Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī, ‘Girl, who are you?
Who is your guardian? I cannot take as my own a woman who belongs to
another.’ Then at that time he recited these verses:
43. 128
“ ‘You who are beautiful with excellent physical qualities,
Who have a pure body of merit with excellent signs,
Give your answer to these questions I ask you:
To whom do you, who have a perfect body, belong? {11}
43. 129
“ ‘Do you have a father and mother or not?
Are you unmarried, or who has authority over you?
You who have a beautiful body, should I perceive you
As belonging to some other being or see you as mine? {12} [F.238.a]
43. 130
“ ‘In your mind you do not delight in killing?
You do not take from others what is not given?
You do not delight in sexual misconduct?
You do not wish in your mind to speak lies? {13}
43. 131
“ ‘You do not use your intelligence to separate friends?
You do not speak harmful words out of anger?


---

You do not have a mind that craves the wealth of others?
You do not intend to cause harm to others? {14}
43. 132
“ ‘You do not enter the pathways into the wilderness of wrong views?
You are not without restraint
 in terms of the different kinds of karma?
1790
Do you not fall under the power of deceit and trickery?
Do you not cause wicked harm in the world? {15}
43. 133
“ ‘Are you affectionate and respectful
To father, mother, relatives, friends, and gurus?
Do you have in your mind the intention to give
To gatherings of those who have become destitute? {16}
43. 134
“ ‘Do you have the intention to please the good friends1791
Who give you timely advice in accord with the Dharma,
Who make the body and the mind tractable
So that they may be completely purified?
 {17}
1792
43. 135
“ ‘Do you honor the buddhas?
Do you have great delight in the bodhisattvas?
Do you or do you not know the supreme Dharma
From which are born the sons of the sugatas? {18}
43. 136
“ ‘Do you dwell in a supreme Dharma mind?
Do you not have a mind that acts contrary to the Dharma?
Do you have a perfect mind that respectfully delights
In the ocean of the qualities of infinite excellence? {19}
43. 137
“ ‘Do you have a kind mind toward those beings
Who have no protector, are destitute, and have no guide?1793
Do you have compassion in your mind for those unfortunate ones
Who have entered the path that leads to the lower existences? {20}
43. 138
“ ‘Do you have perfect rejoicing
When you see the good fortune of others?
When beings are enslaved by their kleśas,
Do you have equanimity through the power of wisdom, or not? {21}
43. 139
“ ‘When you see many beings in the sleep of ignorance,
Do you pray that they will attain perfect enlightenment? [F.238.b]
Are you not disheartened by the supreme prayer
To practice bodhisattva conduct for endless kalpas?’ {22}

“Then Sudarśanā, the preeminent courtesan, who was the mother of the girl
Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī, said to the young prince Tejodhipati, ‘Prince, this
daughter of mine had a miraculous birth; she was born from inside a lotus.
She has not until now been outside of her home.’ Then at that time she
recited these verses:
43. 141
“ ‘I will give you, in order, the answers
To the questions you have asked this girl.
I request you to listen, for I shall relate to you
The way in which the birth of this girl occurred. {23}
43. 142
“ ‘At the end of the night
 when you were born,
1794
At that same time this daughter of mine was born.
She appeared miraculously from within a stainless lotus,
Born with all her limbs complete, with lovely wide eyes. {24}
43. 143
“ ‘During the best of seasons, the time of spring,
When herbs, harvests, and sprouts emerge,
I was wandering happily1795
In a perfect park of sal trees. {25}
43. 144
“ ‘Variegated leaves were growing on the branches.
The masses
 of blossoming trees were like clouds.
1796
Various birds were singing in the trees.
I was happy, joyful, and carefree in the forest. {26}
43. 145
“ ‘I was accompanied by eight hundred girls
Who were adorned and very beautiful,
Wearing all kinds of jewels
And trained well in music and song. {27}
43. 146
“ ‘I, together with the many women,
Proceeded joyfully to an area
Where there were white lotuses with supreme scents
And a pond with banks covered in petals. {28}
43. 147
“ ‘In the middle of the water there appeared
A perfect, precious thousand-petaled lotus.
Its leaves were jewels and its stem was beryl,
And its pericarp was made of Jambu River gold. {29}
43. 148
“ ‘It had filaments of aromatic supreme jewels
And radiated a great light throughout Jambudhvaja. [F.239.a]
At that time, all beings were bewildered, wondering,

“Has a sun arisen in the middle of the night?” {29}
43. 149
“ ‘When the night came to an end, that great lotus
And the light of the great
 sun dawned.
1797
Together with the light, it emitted melodious sounds.
And these were omens of her birth. {31}
43. 150
“ ‘A precious girl such as this was going to appear
In this world because of pure, perfect conduct.
The karma of one’s previous actions is never lost,
And this was the result of her past excellent conduct. {32}
43. 151
“ ‘Her hair was deep blue and her wide eyes were blue lotuses;
She had the voice of Brahmā and a pure color.
She was costumed in perfect garlands and jewelry
And was born from a lotus, glorious and without stain. {33}
43. 152
“ ‘Her body was pure, all parts in proportion.1798
Her body was perfectly shaped, her limbs fully formed.
She was like a golden statue adorned with jewels.
She was shining, illuminating all directions. {34}
43. 153
“ ‘From her body came the aroma of sandalwood, the supreme perfume,
Which coming from her body spread in all directions.
When she spoke, there were beautiful and divine sounds.
From her mouth came the scent of the blue lotus. {35}
43. 154
“ ‘Whenever she smiled or whenever she laughed,
There arose the melodious sound of music.
A precious female had appeared in this world
Who would never be under the power of anyone ordinary. {36}
43. 155
“ ‘There is no one else in this world
Apart from yourself who could be her master.
You who possess a beautiful body adorned by the signs,
I pray you accept this girl who is before you. {37}
43. 156
“ ‘She is not too tall and not too short.
She is not too plump and not too thin.

“Then Prince Tejodhipati came to Gandhāṅkura prabha megha, and, in the
presence of Sudarśanā, the preeminent courtesan, who was the mother of
Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī, he said to Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī, ‘Girl, I have
undertaken to attain the highest, complete enlightenment. Therefore, I have
to gather an immeasurable accumulation of omniscience. Throughout kalpas
with no end or middle I must practice bodhisattva conduct and complete all
the perfections. I must make offerings to the tathāgatas until the very last of

future kalpas. [F.240.b] I shall obtain the teachings of all the buddhas. I shall
purify all buddha realms. I shall not be separated from the families of all
tathāgatas. I shall ripen all the families
 of beings. I shall dispel the
suffering of saṃsāra for all beings. I shall bring beings to a bliss that is
beyond all limits. I shall purify the eyes of wisdom of all beings. I shall be
dedicated to the accomplishments of all bodhisattvas. I shall rest in the
equanimity of all bodhisattvas. I shall accomplish the bhūmis of all
bodhisattvas. I shall purify the realms of all beings. I shall give away all my
wealth so as to eliminate the poverty of all beings.
1805
43. 175
“ ‘While I am practicing the perfection of generosity until the last future
kalpa, I shall satisfy beings with the gift of food and drink, and through the
gift of all kinds of artifacts I must bring satisfaction to all assemblies of
supplicants.
43. 176
“ ‘While I am in that way practicing the dedication to giving away
everything, there will be nothing internal or external that I will not give
away. Therefore, I will have to give away even my sons, daughters, and
wives. I will have to give away my eyes, head, legs, arms, and the greater
and smaller parts of my body.
43. 177
“ ‘At that time, you would become an obstacle to my generosity of giving
to others. You would become unhappy when I give away our beautiful sons.
You would experience much physical and mental suffering. When I give
away everything, you would become miserly. When I cut off the greater and
smaller parts of my body and give them to supplicants, [F.241.a] you would
become unhappy. There will also come a time when I would abandon you
and enter homelessness within the teaching of a tathāgata. At that time you
would become unhappy.’
43. 178
“Then, at that time, Prince Tejodhipati recited these verses to the girl
Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī:
43. 179
“ ‘I have developed compassion for all beings.
For a long time I have been set on enlightenment.
I must complete all the limitless oceans
Of the great accumulations for true enlightenment. {56}
43. 180
“ ‘For an ocean of kalpas that has no edge or middle,
As measureless as space, I have purified my prayers.
I must completely purify throughout endless kalpas
The bhūmis on which the tathāgatas reside. {57}
43. 181
“ ‘I will train in the path of the perfections
Of all the jinas who appear in the three times.
I must purify the supreme path to enlightenment
Through the great way of the highest wisdom. {58}

43. 182
“ ‘I will completely purify of defilements
All the realms that are in every direction.
I must dispel all unfortunate states in worlds
And even all the lower existences. {59}
43. 183
“ ‘I must purify every being, without exception,
Enveloped in the darkness of ignorance and obscured by kleśas.
I must purify them through various methods
And bring them into the way of the path to omniscience. {60}
43. 184
“ ‘I shall purify all the levels of nonattachment
And make offerings to the jinas for an ocean of kalpas.
I had developed love for all beings without exception,
And I must give away everything in the world. {61}
43. 185
“ ‘When I see supplicants gathering and coming,
I will dedicate myself to giving away everything.
At that time won’t you be in disagreement with me
And become saddened and be downcast? {62} [F.241.b]

“ ‘When I see someone come who wants my head,
And if I then practice bodhisattva conduct,
You will at that time be tormented by suffering.

At that time you will be distressed.

My children and even you, to the crowds of supplicants.
On hearing this, see if it does not sadden you.
All that you wish for depends on that.’ {65}
43. 189
“Then the girl Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī said to Prince Tejodhipati, ‘Prince, may
it be just as you have said, and I will do whatever you want. I will enjoy
whatever you wish. Wherever you wish to go, I will follow you
everywhere.
 I will always be in your presence, I will be dedicated to your
goals, I will act in harmony with you, and I will practice sincerely; my
conduct will be engaged in practicing that which accords with you.’
1807

“Then the girl Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī recited these verses to Prince
Tejodhipati:

By being incinerated in the fires
 of hell,

I will have the fortitude to assist you
In our common practice during an ocean of lifetimes. {66}
43. 192
“ ‘Even though my body is chopped up
In each rebirth in endless lifetimes,
I will be resolute in my fortitude
To have you, virtuous one, as my husband. {67}
43. 193
“ ‘Even though, for endless kalpas, my head
Is crushed
 by the Cakravāla mountains, [F.242.a]
1810
I would not be unhappy but would have faith in you,
And you would always be my spouse. {68}
43. 194
“ ‘Within all our countless lifetimes,
Give me mental stability and control over my own mind,
And cut off my limbs and give them to others:
I pray that you establish me firmly in your Dharma. {69}
43. 195
“ ‘All my successive bodies, without exception,1811
I offer to you, a divine man.
When you practice the conduct in an ocean of kalpas,
I pray you use it to please the supplicants. {70}
43. 196
“ ‘You developed endless compassion for all beings
In order to gather together an ocean of beings.
You are set on attaining supreme, perfect enlightenment,
So from now on hold me too in your compassion. {71}
43. 197
“ ‘I desire you, the supreme being, as a husband,
Not for the sake of possessions, not for the sake of wealth,
And not for the sake of enjoying sensual pleasures
But in order to practice the same conduct as you. {72}
43. 198
“ ‘The way in which you look upon the world
Is with clear, beautiful eyes and a mind of love,
With great compassion and a mind free of passion:
Lord of sages, I have no doubt in you. {73}
43. 199
“ ‘The ground upon which you have trod
Has become stainless with the light of jewels.

“ ‘I have seen in a dream
A tathāgata
 at the foot of the lord of trees

With many sons of the buddhas before him. {75}
43. 201
“ ‘Sūrya gātra pravara, lord of jinas,
Shining like precious Jambu River gold —
I saw him in a dream stroking my head,
And so today was filled with joy. {76}
43. 202
“ ‘A goddess with a pure body
Named Ratiprabhā, a relative in the past, [F.242.b]
Proclaimed to me that this tathāgata
Was present at the bodhimaṇḍa. {77}
43. 203
“ ‘Before that I developed the aspiration
Of thinking I shall see you, Prince Tejodhipati.
The goddess proclaimed to me,
“You will see that prince today!”

“ ‘I dreamed of seeing the sugata,
And I also saw you, a pure being.
You, a wish-fulfilling jewel, and I
Will today make offerings to that jina.’
 {79}
1815
43. 205
“Then Prince Tejodhipati, on hearing the name of the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra-
pravara, developed a powerful great aspiration and joy on having gained the
opportunity to see that buddha. He scattered five hundred jewels on the girl
Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī, gave her his crest jewel called glorious shining
light,
 and covered her with precious clothing the color of fire and adorned
her with excellent precious jewels.
1816
43. 206
“Though she was honored in that way, she did not delight or rejoice in it
or become overjoyed, but with her hands together in homage remained
gazing with her eyes fixed upon the face of Prince Tejodhipati.
43. 207
“Then Sudarśanā, the preeminent courtesan, recited these verses to Prince
Tejodhipati:

“ ‘I have, for a long time, been thinking
That I will give
 you this daughter of mine.

Today I give you this one who has a beautiful body
Adorned by excellent merits and possessing excellent qualities. {80}

“ ‘You will not find in the human world
Another excellent girl who is like this.

She is the best woman in all the world. {81} [F.243.a]

“ ‘Her birth was emergence from within a lotus.
She is worthy, unstained by vices.
Her mind is unblemished by any fault.

Sick people who touch her
Instantly become healthy. {83}

“ ‘Her body exudes the aroma of perfume
So perfect it overshadows all other perfumes.
All people who smell her lovely aroma
Are established in pure, correct conduct. {84}
43. 213
“ ‘Her body is like the color of gold
And shines like the best
 of lotuses.
1819
All angry beings without exception
Become loving on seeing her. {85}

“ ‘Her speech is sweet, beautiful, and charming
So that it is a delight for beings to listen to.
Hearing it dispels the darkness of faults
And causes there to be no wish to do bad actions. {86}
43. 215
“ ‘She has pure motivation and a stainless mind.
She never has any deception or trickery.
Whatever she says, that is what is in her mind,
And with her words she brings contentment to beings. {87}

She is not haughty because of her entourage.
She is free of pride and arrogance

43. 218
“Then Prince Tejodhipati, accompanied by the girl Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī
and her entourage, and by his entourage of twenty thousand maidens, left
Gandhāṅkura śikhara prabha meghā Park and went to the Dharmodgata-
prabhāsa bodhimaṇḍa, [F.243.b] where the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Sūrya-
gātra pravara, was, in order to gaze upon the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Sūrya-
gātra pravara, bow down to him, make offerings to him, and honor him.
43. 219
“They rode as far as the gateway and then proceeded on foot to come into
the presence of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara.
43. 220
“Prince Tejodhipati saw from afar that the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak-
saṃbuddha Sūrya gātra pravara was attractive, handsome, with pacified
senses, with a pacified mind, with restrained senses, as tamed as an
elephant, and as clear, undefiled, and serene
 as a lake.
1821
43. 221
“On seeing him in that way, Prince Tejodhipati was attracted to him, and
with his mind attracted to him, there increased within him the power of great
faith and joy on seeing the Buddha. With that increasing joy, faith, and
attraction, he circumambulated the Bhagavat, keeping him to his right, many
hundreds of thousands of times.
43. 222
“The girl Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī and the rest of the entourages bowed
their heads to the Bhagavat’s feet and scattered five hundred thousand
lotuses made of excellent jewels over the Bhagavat. They built for the
Bhagavat five hundred vihāras made from various aromatic materials and
kings of jewels and adorned by various kings of jewels. Each vihāra was
adorned by five thousand kings of precious jewels.
43. 223
“Then the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara, knowing the
thoughts of Prince Tejodhipati, taught the sūtra called The Lamp for Seeing All
Entrances.
43. 224
“When Prince Tejodhipati heard that, he attained ten oceans of samādhis
of the ways of all Dharmas. [F.244.a] They were like this:
43. 225
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called the arising of an ocean of
prayers of all the tathāgatas.
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called the essence of the appearances
of the three times.
43. 226
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called the arising of the
manifestation of the fields of all the buddhas.
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called entering the illumination of
the entire vast extent of being.
43. 227
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called entering the illumination of
wisdom that arises in all worlds.
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called the lamp that illuminates the
entry into the ocean of the faculties of all beings.

43. 228
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called the cloud of wisdom that
protects all beings.
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called the lamp that manifests the
ripening and guiding of all beings.
43. 229
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called the perception of the words of
the Dharma wheels of all tathāgatas.
“He attained the gateway of the samādhi called the cloud of the prayers that
purify the field of completely good conduct.
43. 230
“He attained those ten samādhi gateways and so on, a further ten oceans
of gateways to samādhis in all the ways of the Dharma.
“Also, the girl Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī attained the realization called the
essence of the ocean of the wisdom that is difficult to accomplish and became
irreversible in her progress to the highest, complete enlightenment.
43. 231
“Then Prince Tejodhipati bowed his head to the feet of the Bhagavat, the
Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara and circumambulated the Bhagavat many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right, [F.244.b] and then,
together with the girl Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī and his entourage, he departed
from the presence of the Bhagavat.
43. 232
“He went to the royal capital Druma meru śrī and to his father King
Dhanapati. He came into his presence, bowed his head to the feet of King
Dhanapati, and said, ‘Your Majesty, I request that you heed me. There has
appeared in the world a tathāgata, an arhat, a samyak saṃbuddha, one with
wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who knows the world’s beings, an
unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a teacher of devas and humans, a
buddha, a bhagavat, named Sūrya gātra pravara. He is dwelling in your
realm’s bodhimaṇḍa called Dharma meghodgata prabhā. It is not long since
he attained complete buddhahood.’
1822
43. 233
“Then King Dhanapati said to Prince Tejodhipati, ‘Prince, did a deity or a
human tell you about this?’
“He replied, ‘A girl named Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī told me.’
43. 234
“Then King Dhanapati, having heard that a buddha had appeared,
thought how he had obtained the treasure of the birth of a buddha. He
thought how it was difficult to meet a precious buddha. He thought how
seeing a tathāgata dispels the danger of the abyss of the lower existences.
He thought how it was like encountering a great king of medicines that
cures the great illness of the kleśas. He thought how this liberates
 from
all the sufferings of saṃsāra. He thought how this establishes one in perfect
happiness. He thought how this is a great lamp that eliminates the darkness
of ignorance. [F.245.a] He thought how this is like obtaining a protector in
the way of the Dharma for a world that has no protector. He thought how
1823

this is the appearance of a guide through the yāna of omniscience for a
world that has no guide. On hearing that a buddha had appeared, he felt
great joy and faith.
43. 235
“He 
gathered 
together 
all 
the 
kṣatriyas, 
the 
brahmins, 
the
townspeople,
 the country people, the ministers, the court priests, the
princes, the local governors, the guardians, and the court. He bestowed the
kingdom and the protection of the Dharma on Prince Tejodhipati, who had
announced the appearance of the buddha.
1824
43. 236
“Having anointed him as the sovereign, he went together with two
thousand people to where the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara
was. Having come into his presence, he bowed his head to the Bhagavat’s
feet, circumambulated the Bhagavat, keeping him to his right, many
hundreds of thousands of times, and then sat with his entourage before the
Bhagavat.
43. 237
“The Bhagavat Sūrya gātra pravara looked at King Dhanapati and all his
entourage. At that time his ūrṇā hair radiated a light ray called a lamp for the
minds of all beings. It illuminated the world realms in the ten directions and
came before all the lords of the worlds, manifested countless buddha
miracles, and purified the thoughts and higher motivations of the beings
who were being guided by the buddhas.
43. 238
“At that time, through the inconceivable blessing of the buddha, and
through possessing a buddha’s body higher than all worlds, and through
the entire ocean of the aspects of the voice of a buddha, [F.245.b] he taught
the dhāraṇī gateway called the lamp of the meaning of all the Dharmas freed from
darkness, together with dhāraṇī gateways as numerous as the atoms in a
buddha realm.
43. 239
“Then King Dhanapati, having heard that dhāraṇī gateway, generated a
great Dharma illumination of all Dharmas.
43. 240
“The bodhisattvas in that assembly, who were as numerous as the atoms
in Jambudvīpa, also attained the dhāraṇī gateway called the lamp of the
meaning of all the Dharmas freed from darkness. Sixty hundred thousand million
beings had their minds liberated from defilements, without grasping. Ten
thousand beings gained a stainless, pure, unclouded Dharma vision of all
Dharmas. Countless beings who had not
 previously developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment developed that
aspiration. Also, the manifestation of inconceivable buddha miracles in the
ten directions guided a vast extent of beings, without end or middle, by

“Then King Dhanapati, who had attained the illumination of the Dharma,
thought, ‘Living in a home, I will not be able to comprehend such a Dharma
as this and will not be able to accomplish this kind of wisdom. I will enter


---

homelessness as a servant of this bhagavat.’
43. 242
“King Dhanapati said to the Bhagavat, ‘Bhagavat, I wish to enter
homelessness in the presence of the Bhagavat and enter the way of a
complete bhikṣu.’
“The Bhagavat said, ‘Great king, you may consider that the time for that
has come.’
43. 243
“Then King Dhanapati, together with ten thousand beings, entered
homelessness in the presence of the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara. Not long
after entering homelessness, he accomplished the dhāraṇī gateway called the
lamp of the meaning of all the Dharmas freed from darkness and its accompanying
dhāraṇī gateways, [F.246.a] meditated on them, and meditated on them well.
He also attained many samādhi gateways. He also attained the ten higher
cognitions of a bodhisattva. He also entered an ocean of the ways of
discernment. He also attained a pure body called the unimpeded field of activity,
through which he went without impediment into the presence of the
tathāgatas in the ten directions. He obtained and held the Dharma wheels of
that bhagavat and spoke about them with people, and he became a great
dharmabhāṇaka and was a holder of the teaching. Through the power of
attaining the higher cognitions, he spread throughout all world realms and
manifested bodies to beings in accordance with their aspirations. He told
them about this appearance of a buddha, told them about the nature of the
accomplishments of the past tathāgatas, told them about the perfection of
their past applications, described the power of the miraculous manifestations
of the buddhas, and in that way was a holder of the teaching.
43. 244
“Prince Tejodhipati attained the seven precious possessions of a
cakravartin on that very day, when the moon became full. When he was on
the palace roof encircled by a gathering of women, there appeared before
him a great precious wheel called Pratihatavega, which had a hundred
thousand spokes, was adorned by all jewels, was made from divine Jambu
River gold, was shining, and possessed every supreme feature. A great
precious elephant called Vajra ratna giri tejas appeared. A precious horse
called Nīla giryanila vega appeared. A great precious jewel called Āditya-
garbha prabha megha rāja appeared. [F.246.b] The girl Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī
appeared as the precious queen. A precious householder called Prabhūta-
ghana skandha appeared. And seventh, a precious minister called Vimala-
netra appeared.
43. 245
“In that way, he became a cakravartin king, a possessor of the seven
jewels, a sovereign over the four continents, a follower of the Dharma, a
Dharma king, and a victor, endowed with the power and vigor of an empire.
43. 246
“He had a thousand sons who were courageous and heroic, with perfectly
formed bodies, who could crush the armies of enemies.

43. 247
“He ruled the great land to the ends of the mountains and oceans,
adorning it with the Dharma, and it was free of problems, without enemies,
free of harm, without violence, thriving, prosperous, peaceful, with excellent
harvests, joyful, and filled with many beings.
43. 248
“There were eighty-four thousand royal capitals in that Jambudvīpa, and
in each royal city five hundred vihāras were established, and all of them had
all the best features. They all had a perfection of all kinds of requisites and
pleasures. They all had gardens, buildings, and walkways and were adorned
by rows of forests that could be enjoyed at all times.
43. 249
“In each vihāra was erected a caitya of the Tathāgata as large as a
mountain and adorned on the inside with many jewels and beautified by
various kings of jewels.
43. 250
“The Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara and his followers were invited to come
to all those royal cities. In all those royal cities, inconceivable offerings of
every kind worthy of a tathāgata were made to that tathāgata. [F.247.a] He
was asked to come because the miraculous manifestations of a buddha’s
entry into a town generated roots of merit in beings. Beings there who had
no faith attained faith. Beings who had faith had an increased power of joy
on seeing the buddha. Beings who had an increased power of joy attained
the pure aspiration to enlightenment. Beings who had the pure aspiration to
enlightenment developed the motivation of great compassion. Beings who
were engaged in benefiting beings became dedicated to seeking all the
Dharma of the buddhas. Beings who were learned in the ways of the Dharma
of the buddhas focused their minds on realizing the nature of all phenomena.
Beings who had realized the equality of all phenomena focused their minds
on realizing the equality of the three times. Beings who had attained the
illumination of the knowledge of the three times entered the light of wisdom
in order to perceive the succession of buddhas. The beings who had realized
the perception of the various tathāgatas focused their minds on gathering all
beings. The beings who were dedicated to gathering beings generated
prayers to purify the bodhisattva path. Beings who had realized the equality
of the path gave rise to the light of wisdom in order to attain the Dharma
wheels of all the buddhas. [F.247.b] The beings who had turned toward the
aspects
 of the ocean of the Dharma focused their minds on pervading the
entire net of realms with their own bodies. The beings who had realized the
equality of the realms prayed to know the ocean of the capabilities of beings.
The beings who were dedicated to analyzing exactly the aspirations and
capabilities of beings purified the motivation to realize omniscience.
1826
43. 251
“King Tejodhipati, seeing that beings gained that kind of accomplishment
of those kinds of goals, requested the Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara to come
to all those royal cities in order to ripen and guide those beings through his


---

inconceivable manifestations and miracles.
43. 252
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was Prince
Tejodhipati? Do not think that it was anyone else, for at that time, in that
time, the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Śākyamuni was the Prince Tejodhipati
who became the sovereign of a cakravartin’s kingdom and honored the
Tathāgata Sūrya gātra pravara.
43. 253
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was King
Dhanapati, the father of Prince Tejodhipati? Do not think that it was anyone
else, for at that time, in that time, the Tathāgata Ratna kusuma prabha was
King Dhanapati. He is now at a bodhimaṇḍa called Sarva vaśita kāya-
pratibhāsa
 in a world realm called Buddha prabhā maṇḍala śrī pradīpā,
which is in a central group of world realms called Tryadhva pratibhāsa maṇi-
rāja saṃbhavā, in an ocean of world realms called Dharma dhātu gagana-
pratibhāsa megha, which is to the east beyond an ocean of world realms as
numerous as the atoms in an ocean of world realms. [F.248.a] There he has
attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood and is
teaching the Dharma encircled by an assembly of bodhisattvas as numerous
as the atoms in countless buddha realms.
1827
43. 254
“When the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Ratna kusuma prabha,
 was
previously practicing bodhisattva conduct, he purified the ocean of world
realms called Dharma dhātu gagana pratibhāsa megha. All the tathāgatas who
have appeared, are appearing, and will appear in that ocean of world realms
were all ripened for the highest, complete enlightenment by the Bhagavat,
the Tathāgata Ratna kusuma prabha, during his past practice of bodhisattva
conduct.
1828
43. 255
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was the
king’s queen Padma śrī garbha saṃbhavā, the mother of Prince Tejodhipati,
preeminent among the eighty-four thousand wives? Do not think that it was
anyone else, noble one, for at that time, in that time, Māyādevī, the mother of
the Bhagavat, who gave birth to the bodhisattva, who is established in the
liberation of unobscured, complete illumination, who has directly perceived
the accomplishments of tathāgatas in the past, who knows the visions of the
births of all bodhisattvas, was King Dhanapati’s preeminent queen, Padma-
śrī garbha saṃbhavā. [F.248.b]
43. 256
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Sudarśanā, the preeminent courtesan? Do not think that it was anyone else,
noble one, for at that time, in that time, my mother, Sunetrā, the wife of the
Śākya Daṇḍapāṇi, was Sudarśanā, the preeminent courtesan.
43. 257
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was the girl
Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī? Do not think that it was anyone else, noble one, for
at that time, in that time, I was Sucalita rati prabhāsa śrī, the daughter of the

courtesan.
43. 258
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who were the
entourage of King Tejodhipati? Do not think that they were anyone else,
noble one, for they are now those who are established in this very assembly
of followers who are bodhisattvas established by the Bhagavat in the
perfection of the completely good conduct and prayer of bodhisattvas;
whose bodies appeared as images in all world realms; whose minds never
lapse from the practice of all bodhisattva samādhis; whose eyes have the
perception of directly seeing the faces of all tathāgatas; whose ears perceive
the voices of the clouds of the aspects of the speech, as vast as space, of all
the tathāgatas that resound with the wheel of the Dharma; whose
inhalations and exhalations have power over the practice of all Dharmas; the
sound of whose names resound throughout all the buddha realms;
whose bodhisattva bodies go without interruption to the circles of the
assemblies of all the tathāgatas; [F.249.a] who create bodies that manifest to
all beings, in accordance with their aspirations, in ways that are favorable for
ripening and guidance; and who, spreading throughout the entirety of the
net of the directions, accomplish and perfect the completely good conduct
and prayer continuously throughout all future kalpas and are present in the
circle of the assembly of the Bhagavat.

“Noble one, those and other tathāgatas numbering altogether sixty
sextillion appeared in that world realm. I served them all with clothing, food,
alms, bedding, medicine during times of illness, and necessary articles,
showed them respect, honored them, venerated them, and made offerings to
them.
43. 278
“Noble one, the last of those sixty hundred thousand trillion buddhas was
the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Vipula dharmādhimukti saṃbhava-
tejas. When that tathāgata came to the city, I was the king’s wife. Together
with householders, we practiced the gateways of every kind of offering, and
after making offerings with the offerings for a tathāgata, we heard from that
bhagavat the Dharma teaching called [F.251.a] The Lamp of the Arising of the
Births of All the Tathāgatas. On hearing that, I attained the eyes of wisdom, and
I attained this bodhisattva liberation called the range of the view of all the ways of
the ocean of the samādhis of the bodhisattvas.
43. 279
“Noble one, meditating on this liberation, I practiced bodhisattva conduct
together with the bodhisattva for kalpas as numerous as the atoms in a
hundred thousand buddha realms. During those kalpas as numerous as the
atoms in that number of buddha realms, I served a vast extent of tathāgatas
without end or middle. In some kalpas, I served a single tathāgata who
remained for an entire kalpa. In some kalpas, I served two tathāgatas. In
some kalpas, I served countless
 tathāgatas. In some kalpas, I served as
many tathāgatas as there are atoms in a buddha realm.
1833
43. 280
“During that time, my bodhisattva bodies’ sizes, shapes, and colors were
beyond comprehension. The activities of my bodies were beyond
comprehension. The activities of my speech and of my mind were beyond
comprehension. My wisdom’s sight, my wisdom’s range of activity, and the
scope of my wisdom’s samādhi were also beyond comprehension.
43. 281
“Noble one, when beings
 see a bodhisattva and the practice of
bodhisattva conduct, they admire the bodhisattva and with various gestures
and approaches are attracted to the bodhisattva who cares for them through
various worldly and nonworldly ways, so that they became the bodhisattva’s
followers. [F.251.b] When they accompany as followers the bodhisattva who
practices bodhisattva conduct, they become irreversible in their progress to
the highest, complete enlightenment.
1834
43. 282
“Noble one, in that way, as soon as I saw the Tathāgata Vipula-
dharmādhimukti saṃbhava tejas, I attained this bodhisattva liberation called
the range of the view of all the ways of the ocean of the samādhis of the bodhisattvas.
Meditating on this liberation, I accompanied the bodhisattva for kalpas as
numerous as the atoms in a hundred
 buddha realms. I served, made
1835


---

offerings to, and venerated all the tathāgatas that appeared during those
kalpas as numerous as the atoms in buddha realms. I heard the teaching of
the Dharma from all those tathāgatas, obtaining it and keeping it. I also
obtained from all those buddha bhagavats this liberation through various
ways, through various teachings of the ways of the sūtras, through various
natures of liberation, through various entrances to liberation, through
various practices of liberation, through various engagements in times,
through various entries into realms, through various perceptions of oceans
of visions of buddhas, through various entries into the circles of followers of
tathāgatas, through various paths of the ways of oceans of bodhisattva
prayers, through various accomplishments of bodhisattva conduct, and
through various vast extents of bodhisattva liberations. However, I still had
not realized the way of completely good bodhisattva conduct.
43. 283
“Why is that? [F.252.a] Because the way of the liberation of completely
good bodhisattvas is as immeasurable as the extent of space, as
immeasurable as the extent of the conceptualizations
 of beings, as
immeasurable as the extent of the ocean of the divisions of the three times, as
immeasurable as the extent of the ocean of the directions, and as
immeasurable as the extent of the ocean of the ways of the realm of
phenomena.
1836
43. 284
“Noble one, the nature of the way of the liberations of the completely good
bodhisattvas is the same as the scope of perception of the tathāgatas.
43. 285
“In that way, noble one, for kalpas as numerous as the atoms in buddha
realms I gazed again and again upon the bodhisattva’s body without ever
having enough of seeing it.
43. 286
“Noble one, it was like when a man and woman have arranged to come
together purely for the enjoyment of passion, and there arises an
immeasurable development of their state of mind through their being
intoxicated by the concepts and thoughts of purity that arise from fallacious
mental activity.
43. 287
“Noble one, in the same way, when I looked upon the bodhisattva’s body,
in each instant of mind, from each pore there appeared to my eyes an
immeasurable vast extent of groups of world realms without end or middle,
with various grounds, various arrays of borders, various shapes, various
arrays of mountains, various displays of arrays of grounds, various skies
adorned by coverings of clouds, various natures, names, and numbers, and
various appearances of buddhas and successions of tathāgatas, adorned by
various bodhimaṇḍas, with various miraculous manifestations of the turning
of the Dharma wheel by tathāgatas, with various arrays of the circles of
followers of tathāgatas, with the various sounds of the teaching of the


---

various ways of the sūtras, with the various accomplishments of the ways of
the yānas, [F.252.b] with the various illuminations from pure lights and
radiances, and with omens that have never been seen before.
43. 288
“From each pore there appeared to my eyes oceans of buddhas without
end or middle. In each instant of mind, from each pore, there appeared
continuously to my eyes the adornment of various bodhimaṇḍas, the
miraculous manifestations of the various turnings of the Dharma wheel, and
the miraculous manifestations of the sounds of the various ways of the
sūtras.
43. 289
“In each instant of mind, from each pore, there appeared to my eyes a vast
ocean of beings without end or middle, with houses, parks, divine palaces,
rivers, oceans, and dwellings, with various forms and bodies, with various
ranges of enjoyments, with various engagements in conduct and behavior,
and with various forms of perfections of faculties.
43. 290
“From each pore there appeared to my eyes ways of entering an ocean of
the three times, without end or middle.
“An ocean, without end or middle, of bodhisattva prayers were purified.
43. 291
“There appeared an ocean, without end or middle, of different forms of
conduct of the bodhisattva bhūmis.
“There appeared a pure ocean, without end or middle, of the perfections of
the bodhisattvas.
43. 292
“There appeared an ocean, without end or middle, of the past practices of
the bodhisattvas.
“There appeared an ocean, without end or middle, of the ways of
purifying buddha realms.
43. 293
“There appeared an ocean, without end or middle, of the ways of the great
love of bodhisattvas.1837
“I comprehended their entering oceans of the power and methods for
ripening and guiding all beings. [F.253.a]
43. 294
“They accomplished an ocean, without end or middle, of the ways of the
clouds of the great compassion of bodhisattvas.
“They increased an ocean, without end or middle, of the great power of
the joy of bodhisattvas.
“In each instant of mind, they accomplished an ocean, without end or
middle, of the methods of gathering all beings.
43. 295
“Noble one, in that way, for kalpas as numerous as the atoms in a hundred
buddha realms, in each instant of mind I perceived and comprehended an
ocean, without end or middle, of the ways of the Dharma in each pore of the
bodhisattva. Nevertheless, I did not comprehend them in their entirety, even
though I never perceived again what I had perceived before, even though I
did not hear again what I had already heard before.

43. 296
“Noble one, in that way, when I was in the harem of Sarvārtha siddha, who
had an entourage of a crowd of queens, through an ocean of the ways of
comprehending the realm of phenomena I perceived in each of his pores an
ocean, without end or middle, of the ways of the three times.
43. 297
“Noble one, I know and practice only this bodhisattva liberation called the
miraculous manifestations at the birth of bodhisattvas throughout all the perceptions of
countless kalpas. How could I know the conduct, or teach the treasure of
qualities, without exception, of the bodhisattvas who engage in an ocean,
without end or middle, of the ways of methods; who manifest the perception
of bodies in shapes
 that accord with those of all beings; who manifest
conducts that accord with the aspirations of all beings; who emit clouds of
emanations with infinite colors from all their pores; who have the realization,
free of thought, of the pure nature of the bodyless essence of the true nature,
a nature that has the characteristics of space; who with the certainty of
realization at all times are dedicated to miraculous manifestations equal to
those of the tathāgatas; [F.253.b] who engage in miraculous manifestation
through the scope of the liberations, which has no end or middle; who
through the generation of motivation have power over entering and
remaining in the vast realm of the Dharma; and who revel in an ocean of
liberations that possess all the gateways into the levels of the Dharma?
1838
43. 298
“Depart, noble one. Here at the feet of the Bhagavat Vairocana, upon a
precious throne with various adornments that has in its center a lotus made
of the kings of precious jewels, is the mother of the bodhisattva, whose name
is Māyādevī. Go to her and ask her, ‘How are bodhisattvas who practice
bodhisattva conduct undefiled by any of the stains of this world? How do
bodhisattvas have an uninterrupted dedication to making offerings to the
tathāgatas? How are bodhisattvas irreversible from attaining the final
accomplishment of their activities? How are they free from obscurations in
their entry into bodhisattva liberations? How are they without expectation of
a reward from others in all their bodhisattva conduct? How do they have the
direct perception of all the tathāgatas? How do they never lapse from their
dedication to gathering all beings? How do they never lapse from remaining
in all bodhisattva conduct until the last future kalpa? How do they never
turn back from the prayers of the Mahāyāna? How do they never lose heart
in maintaining and increasing the roots of merit of all beings?’ ”
43. 299
Then at that time, Gopā, the Śākya maiden, in order to teach completely
this gateway to liberation, through the blessing of the Buddha recited these
verses:
43. 300
“The beings who see the supreme beings
Who are dedicated to perfect bodhisattva conduct, [F.254.a]
Whether they are attracted or in enmity,

All become gathered by him. {90}
43. 301
“I remember as many kalpas
As there are atoms in a hundred realms.
Beyond those there was the Vyūhasa kalpa,
In which was the perfect world realm Meruprabhā. {91}
43. 302
“In that world appeared sages
To the number of sixty sextillion.
The last of those lords of sages
Was the lamp for beings Dharmadhvaja. {92}
43. 303
“At that time there was the King Śrītejas.
After the parinirvāṇa of that lord of sages
In this Jambudhvaja, he destroyed the armies of his adversaries
And became a supreme sovereign with commands that could not be
disobeyed. {93}
43. 304
“He had five hundred sons, who were
All courageous, heroic, and handsome,
With perfectly formed limbs and pure bodies,
And who were unsurpassable and adorned by glory. {94}

Who was a delight to see and had a beautiful form
And was adorned by the thirty-two supreme signs. {96}
43. 307
“He abandoned the kingdom and entered homelessness
Accompanied by an entourage of fifty million men.
As a mendicant, he was dedicated with unwavering diligence
And gained completely the Dharma of the Jina. {97}
43. 308
“There was the city
 named Drumāvatī
1839
Encircled by ten billion excellent towns.
There were forests with a variety of branches,
Peaceful and silent, with unsurpassable splendor. {98}
43. 309
“There, with perfect discipline, dwelled Suraśmi,
Who was fearless, wise, and eloquent.


---

He was teaching the Dharma of the Jina
In order to purify defiled beings. {99}
43. 310
“That wise one, when seeking alms, [F.254.b]
Had a beautiful conduct and peaceful appearance.
He went into town in an unwavering, profound manner
With mindfulness and undistracted eyes. {100}
43. 311
“In the best of towns, Nandīdhvaja,
There was the head merchant Suvighuṣṭa kīrti.
I was his charming, beautiful daughter
By the name of Bhānuprabhā. {101}
43. 312
“At the gateway of our perfect house,
I saw Suraśmi and his entourage,
Handsome, his body adorned by the signs,
And I was greatly attracted to him. {102}
43. 313
“He came to the gateway to my home,
And I placed a jewel
 in his alms bowl.
1840
I also removed all my jewelry,
And with adoration I offered them to him. {103}
43. 314
“Because of making an offering through passion
To that son of the buddhas, Suraśmiketu,
For two hundred and fifty of the longest kalpas
I was not reborn in the lower existences. {104}
43. 315
“I was born into divine families in the realms of the devas
And in the human world as the daughters of kings.
In all those lives he revealed himself to me
In bodies that had endless different forms.
 {105}
1841
43. 316
“After two hundred and fifty kalpas had passed,
I was born as the fearless daughter
Of the preeminent courtesan Sudarśanā
And at that time was known as Saṃcālitā. {106}
43. 317
“When I saw Prince Tejodhipati,
I joyfully made offerings to him.
I offered myself to him
And became his obedient
 wife. {107}
1842
43. 318
“Together we made excellent offerings
To the great ṛṣi Sūrya gātra pravara.


---

With devotion I looked upon that buddha’s face,
And I developed the aspiration for supreme enlightenment. {108}
43. 319
“During that kalpa, I venerated
A full six hundred million jinas. [F.255.a]
In the time of the last of those jinas
There appeared the Buddha Adhimuktitejas. {109}
43. 320
“In that time, I gained pure Dharma eyes
And comprehended the nature of phenomena.
Incorrect thinking completely ceased,
And since that time I have attained illumination. {110}
43. 321
“Since that time, I have seen
The samādhis of the jinas’ progeny.
In each instant of the mind I observe
An inconceivable ocean of realms in all directions. {111}
43. 322
“I see in all directions a variety
Of countless, marvelous pure realms.
I have no attachment to them on seeing them
And no aversion toward those that are defiled. {112}
43. 323
“I see, in every one of those realms,
Every buddha in his bodhimaṇḍa.
In each instant of mind I look upon
Their immeasurable oceans of light. {113}
43. 324
“In each instant of mind I comprehend, without impediment,
The oceans of their circles of followers.
In the same way, I know all their samādhis
And also their countless liberations. {114}
43. 325
“I comprehend their vast activities,
And I know every manner of the bhūmis.
I also know, in each instant, the infinite,
Vast ocean of their countless prayers. {115}
43. 326
“Throughout endless kalpas I gazed upon
The body of the supreme being practicing conduct.
I could never fully know the extent
Of the manifestations from his pores. {116}
43. 327
“I saw countless oceans of many realms,
Even on the tip of a single pore hair.


---

I saw them filled with masses of air,
Great rivers, mountains of earth, and fire. {117}
43. 328
“I perceived a variety of grounds
Having different forms and various kinds of shapes.
They had a variety of elements
 and constituents,
1843
1844
Various different kinds of aspects and forms.
 {118}
1845
43. 329
“I saw clearly and distinctly countless
Oceans of realms, worlds beyond description. [F.255.b]
I saw the jinas who were engaged
In guiding beings through teaching the Dharma. {119}
43. 330
“I cannot comprehend the actions of his body,
Or his speech or his mind, or their actions,
Or his various miraculous manifestations
While practicing his vast conduct for kalpas.” {120}
43. 331
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the Śākya
maiden Gopā, circumambulated the Śākya maiden Gopā many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from the Śākya maiden Gopā. [B16]

Chapter 44
MĀYĀDEVĪ
44. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, on the way to Māyādevī, undertaking the
wisdom of practicing the scope of the activity of the buddhas, thought, “By
what means can I see the kalyāṇamitras, honor them, meet them,
accompany them,
 learn their qualities, know the field of their speech,
understand the succession of their words, and possess the teachings of the
kalyāṇamitras who have six āyatanas that have risen above all worlds; who
have bodies that have transcended all attachments; who follow the path of
unimpeded movement; who have pure Dharma bodies; who have bodies that
are manifestations of illusory physical activities; who perform conducts in
the world that are the illusions of wisdom; who have forms and bodies
from prayer;
 who have bodies that are not born and do not cease; who
have bodies that are neither true nor false; who have bodies that do not pass
away or perish; who have bodies that do not originate and are not destroyed;
who have bodies that have the single characteristic of having no
characteristics; who have bodies that have no attachment to duality; who
have bodies that are based on having no basis; who have bodies that do not
decay
 or diminish; [F.256.a] who have bodies without thoughts, like
reflections; who have active bodies that are like dreams; who have bodies
that do not depart, like the surface of a mirror; who have bodies that are
established in peace, like the absence of directions; who have bodies that
pervade all directions; who have bodies that have no differentiation between
the three times; who have bodiless bodies of mind that are bodies without
thought; who have bodies that have transcended the path of sight in all
worlds; who have bodies that have been tamed through the path of
completely good vision; and who have the unimpeded field of activity of
space?”

While he was dedicated to contemplating and pondering this, Ratnanetrā,
the goddess of the city, appeared in the sky encircled by a crowd of sky
goddesses. Her body was adorned by varieties of jewelry, her body was
covered in adornments, and she scattered handfuls of divine flowers of
many shapes and colors.
44. 3
She said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, you should be
dedicated to protecting the city of the mind by not dwelling in delight in
saṃsāra’s field of perception. [F.256.b]
44. 4
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to adorning the city of the mind
through focusing on the ten strengths of the tathāgatas.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to purifying the city of the mind
through being free of envy, greed, and deception.
44. 5

the mind through realizing the nature of all phenomena.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to increasing the city of the mind
through increasing the power of great dedication to the accumulation of
omniscience.
44. 6
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to protecting the city of the mind’s
treasury of buildings through gaining power over dwelling in the vast
divine palaces of the samādhis, samāpattis, dhyānas, liberations, and the
Dharma.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to illuminating the city of the mind
through seeking the attainment of the perfection of wisdom of all the levels
of the established circles of followers of all the tathāgatas. [F.257.a]
44. 7
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to strengthening the city of the mind
through entering the city of your own mind through the path of the method
of the arising of all the tathāgatas.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to creating the strong walls of the
city of the mind through a pure mind that accomplishes the completely good
conduct and prayers of the bodhisattvas.
44. 8
“Noble 
one, 
you 
should 
be 
dedicated 
to 
accomplishing 
the
inapproachability and indestructibility of the city of the mind through
crushing the army of the māras, the friends of wickedness, who are on the
side of the māras and the kleśas.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to illuminating the city of the mind
through enlightening all beings with the illumination from the knowledge of
the tathāgatas.
44. 9
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to moistening the city of the mind
through acquiring the rain from the clouds of the Dharma of all the
tathāgatas.

“Noble one, you should be dedicated to strengthening the city of the mind
through your mind’s acquisition of the ocean of merit of all the tathāgatas.
44. 10
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to increasing the city of the mind
through great love pervading all beings.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to purifying
 the city of the mind
through establishing the vast parasol of the Dharma as the remedy for bad
qualities.
1851
44. 11
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to making the city of the mind
tremble
 through the mind trembling with vast, great compassion for the
sake of all beings.
1852
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to opening the gates to the city of
the mind through
 providing
 all beings with outer and inner things.
1853
1854
44. 12
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to purifying the city of the mind
through turning away
 from delighting in the sensory range of all of
saṃsāra.
1855
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to strengthening the heart
 of the
city of the mind through making the continuity of bad actions impossible.
1856
44. 13
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to making the city of the mind strong
through never lapsing from the diligence that accomplishes the
accumulation of omniscience.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to illuminating the city of the mind
through the illumination of remembering the field of all the tathāgatas of the
three times.
44. 14
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to being skilled in the ways of
analyzing the city of the mind through being skilled in the wisdom that
analyzes the Dharma gateways of the various sūtras of the Dharma wheel of
all the tathāgatas. [F.257.b]
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to the perception of the city of the
mind through teaching the way of the path and gateways to omniscience
that are directly perceivable by all beings.
44. 15
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to being skilled in the ways of
blessing the city of the mind through the pure accomplishment of the ocean
of prayers of all the tathāgatas in the three times within your own prayer.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to increasing the power of the
accumulations of the city of the mind through increasing the great, vast
accumulations of merit and wisdom in the entire realm of the Dharma.
44. 16
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to being skilled in the method for
emitting light from the city of the mind through knowing the minds,
thoughts, faculties, aspirations, defilements, and purification of all beings.


---

“Noble one, you should be dedicated to being skilled in the way of
gaining power over the city of the mind through gathering all the ways of
the realm of the Dharma.
44. 17
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to illuminating the city of the mind
through remembering and illuminating all the tathāgatas.
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to knowing the nature of the city of
the mind through realizing all the ways of the bodyless Dharma.
44. 18
“Noble one, you should be dedicated to examining as an illusion the city
of the mind through going to the city of the Dharma of omniscience.
“Noble one, in that way the bodhisattva who is dedicated to the
purification of the city of the mind will be able to attain the accomplishment
of all roots of merit.
44. 19
“Why is that? [F.258.a] Because bodhisattvas who thus purify the city of
the mind have before them no obscurations: there are no obscurations to
seeing the buddhas, no obscurations to hearing the Dharma, no obscurations
to venerating and making offerings to the tathāgatas, no obscurations to
engaging in gathering beings, and no obscurations to purifying buddha
realms.
44. 20
“Noble one, bodhisattvas who are dedicated to seeing kalyāṇamitras with
a mind free of all obscurations and with a higher motivation will with little
difficulty see a kalyāṇamitra.
“Noble one, the omniscience of bodhisattvas depends on the
kalyāṇamitras.”
44. 21
Then two of the family of goddesses of the body, who were named
Dharma padma śrī kuśalā and Hrī śrī mañjari prabhāvā,
 encircled by an
innumerable assembly of goddesses, emerged from the bodhimaṇḍa,
uttering praises of Māyādevī. They arranged themselves in the sky before
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, and emitted from their precious
earrings
 a net of many light rays the colors of jewels; many pure
perfumes and incenses the colors of shining lights; colors attractive to mind
and thought; colors that increased the power of joy in the mind; colors that
eased the pains of the body; colors that revealed pure bodies; and nets of
light rays that were a field of perception that gave rise to an unimpeded
prowess of the body and illuminated vast realms.
1857
1858
44. 22
They revealed to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, all the bodies of all
tathāgatas, which are present everywhere and facing everywhere. [F.258.b]
Then they completely circled, to their right, the entire world, and then shone
upon the crown of the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son. They
completely pervaded him, from the crown of his head to the pores of his
body.


---

44. 23
As soon as the light rays from those goddesses touched Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, in that instant he attained the eyesight called the dust-
free illuminations, which was free from all blinding darkness. He attained the
eyesight called free from the obscuration of sight, through which he perceived
the nature of beings. He attained the eyesight called the lord of freedom from
dust, through which he looked at the field of the nature of all phenomena. He
attained the eyesight called lord of purity, through which he looked at the
character
 of all realms. He attained the eyesight called shining light,
through which he looked upon the Dharma bodies of all tathāgatas. He
attained the eyesight called pure intelligence,
 through which he looked
upon the countless categories of the created form bodies of the
tathāgatas.
 He attained the eyesight called unimpeded light, through
which he looked upon the categories of the origination and destruction of
world realms throughout the vast extent of the ocean of realms. He attained
the eyesight called complete light, through which he looked upon the aspect
of the creation of the way of the sūtras in the Dharma wheel of all the
tathāgatas. He attained the eyesight called the complete field of perception,
through which he looked upon the miracles of the buddhas and their
blessings that guide beings. He attained the eyesight called complete sight,
through which he looked upon the births of buddhas that occurred in all
buddha realms. [F.259.a]
1859
1860
1861
44. 24
Then the guardian at the door of the meeting hall of the bodhisattvas, the
leader of ten thousand rākṣasas, whose name was Sunetra, with his wives,
children, relatives, and entourage, threw flowers of many beautiful colors
over Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, and said to him, “Noble one, a
bodhisattva who has ten qualities will be near to all kalyāṇamitras. What are
these ten? They are (1) a pure motivation without deception or guile, (2) a
compassion that gathers all beings without discrimination, (3) the insight
that realizes that the nature of all beings is that there are no beings, (4) a
superior motivation for proceeding irreversibly toward omniscience, (5) the
strength of the aspiration that is directed toward the field of the tathāgatas,
(6) the vision of the purity of the stainlessness of the nature of all
phenomena, (7) the great love without discrimination for the field of beings,
(8) the light of wisdom, which dispels all obscurations, (9) the great cloud of
the Dharma, which is a parasol that counters all the suffering of saṃsāra, and
(10) the eyes of wisdom that are focused on following the kalyāṇamitras and
enter into all the streams within the realm of the Dharma.
“Noble one, the bodhisattva who has these ten qualities will be near to all
kalyāṇamitras.


---

44. 25
“The bodhisattva who sees the ten entryways to resting in samādhi will
attain the direct perception of all kalyāṇamitras. What are those ten? They
are (1) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of the field of analyzing all
phenomena as being like dust-free space, [F.259.b] (2) the entryway to
resting in the samādhi of the vision that directly perceives the ocean of all
directions, (3) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of the nonexamination
and nonanalysis of all perception, (4) the entryway to resting in the samādhi
of the arising of the clouds of tathāgatas in all directions, (5) the entryway to
resting in the samādhi of the essence of the accumulation of an ocean of
omniscient wisdom and merit, (6) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of
the development of all aspirations to be inseparably near to the occurrence of
kalyāṇamitras, (7) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of all the qualities
of the tathāgatas originating from the mouths
 of the kalyāṇamitras, (8)
the entryway to resting in the samādhi of inseparability from all the
tathāgatas, (9) the entryway to resting in the samādhi of being engaged in
being near, always and equally, to all kalyāṇamitras, and (10) the entryway
to resting in the samādhi of engaging without weariness in all the conduct of
methods of the kalyāṇamitras.
1862
44. 26
“Noble one, the bodhisattva who has those ten qualities will attain the
direct perception of all kalyāṇamitras. The bodhisattva who attains the
liberation of the samādhi called the Dharma wheels of all the tathāgatas proclaimed
from the mouth of the kalyāṇamitra will, by entering it, attain the undifferentiated
equality of all buddhas and the undifferentiated omnipresence of the
kalyāṇamitras.”
That is what Sunetra, the lord of the rākṣasas, said. [F.260.a]
44. 27
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, stared into the sky and said,
“Ārya,
 you have regarded me with compassion and without error
taught
 the kalyāṇamitras in order to benefit
 me. In addition, I pray
that you teach me without error the entrance ways to methods concerning
how to apply myself to seeing the kalyāṇamitras, in what direction I should
go, in what places I should search, and upon what goal I should focus my
thoughts.”
1863
1864
1865
44. 28
Sunetra, the lord of the rākṣasas, replied, “Noble one, you should go to the
kalyāṇamitras by going with a body that bows down in every direction, with
thoughts that are fastened on remembering the kalyāṇamitras as their object,
following the samādhi that goes everywhere, with strength of mind that is
like a dream, and traveling with a body of the mind that is like a reflection.”
44. 29
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, practicing as he had been told by
Sunetra, the lord of the rākṣasas, saw rising from the ground before him a
great lotus with a stem made entirely from diamond jewels, with sepals
made from a variety of kings of jewels of the world’s
 oceans, with a circle
1866

of petals formed from all kings of jewels, with a pericarp made of shining
kings of jewels, with filaments the colors and aromas of all the precious
kings of jewels, and covered by a net of countless jewels.1867
44. 30
He saw on the pericarp of that great lotus made of the kings of jewels a
kūṭāgāra called Dharma dhātu diksamavasaraṇa garbha, which was well
adorned and beautiful, with a base that was the shape of a shining vajra.
A full thousand pillars made from the kings of jewels beautifully adorned it.
[F.260.b] Every kind of jewel was displayed as every kind of adornment. Its
floor was made of divine Jambu River gold. Countless nets of various strings
of pearls were spread upon it. It was adorned by a beautifying blend of
various kings of jewels. It had a complete array
 of the precious jewels of
Jambudhvaja.
 It was encircled by countless precious balconies. On all
sides, stairways made of kings of jewels were beautifully arranged.
1868
1869
1870
44. 31
He saw in the center of the kūṭāgāra a throne of wish-fulfilling jewels with
a lotus on its center. It was composed of precious jewels, and its base had the
representations of all
 the lords of the world. It had the colors of all gems
of precious jewels. It had the shape of Indra’s radiant banner. It was set upon
the surface of a ground that was a circle of precious diamonds. It had an
array of rows of various kings of jewels. It was encircled by many precious
platforms. It was decorated by shining banners of kings of jewels. It was
beautified by an array of various jewels. Upon it was placed a cushion that
was superior to divine material. Its surface was covered with precious cloths
of various infinite colors. Decorative canopies of all kinds of precious cloth
adorned the sky. It was draped in nets of all jewels. In all directions there
was the sound of the flapping of arrayed precious banners. Banners of cloth
made of all jewels fluttered. It was adorned by an arrangement of banners of
all precious aromatic jewels. Banners made of all flowers emitted a rain of
showers of various flowers. [F.261.a] Banners of precious bells emitted
melodious, beautiful sounds. All the entrances
 of the building were
decorated
 with strings of various jewels. From various precious jewels in
the form of spouts issued a rain of scented water in many different colors.
From the mouths of elephant lords formed from shining kings of precious
jewels came
 networks of lotuses. From the mouths of lions made of a
variety of diamonds came
 clouds of incense in endless colors. From the
mouths of statues of Brahmā made from shining kings of jewels there
resounded in a loving manner the sound of the voice of Brahmā. From the
mouths of beautiful statues made of various jewels resounded the beautiful
sounds of praises of goodness. From strings of golden bells were emitted the
pleasant sounds of the names of the buddhas in the three times. From strings
of bells made of excellent precious jewels came the beautiful sounds of the
Dharma wheels of all the buddhas. From a variety of diamond bells came the
1871

sounds of all bodhisattva prayers. Various voices resounded from the images
of all the buddhas that arose from strings of moonstone
 kings of jewels.
From strings of emerald
 kings of precious jewels came manifestations of
images of the successive lives of all the tathāgatas in the three times. From
strings of sunstone
 kings of jewels appeared light rays of the range of
various buddha realms throughout the ten directions as far as the limits of
the realm of space. From strings of avabhāsadhvaja kings of jewels shone the
illumination of the halos of light of all the tathāgatas. [F.261.b] From strings
of vairocana kings of jewels radiated light rays in the forms of emanated
clouds of all the lords of worlds, who made offerings to and venerated the
tathāgatas. From strings of wish-fulfilling kings of jewels there spread
throughout the realm of phenomena in each instant the completely good
miraculous manifestations of the bodhisattvas. From strings of vairocana
kings of jewels resounded the sound of the voices of all the apsarases in the
palaces of all the lords of devas emitting clouds of praises of all perceived
tathāgatas, describing their inconceivable good qualities. The throne was
encircled by an array of seats made of countless jewels.
1876

He saw upon that throne Māyādevī. She had a form that transcended the
three worlds. She had a form that resided in all worlds and was above all
existences. She had a form that was perceived by all beings according to
their aspirations
 but was unstained by any world. She had a form that
originated from vast merit and could resemble that of all beings. She had a
form that appeared to all beings but in a way that would accord with
ripening and guiding all beings. She had a form that was directly perceived
by all beings but was at all times
 no different from beings’ perception of
space. She had a form that had the power to be present
 as perceivable
throughout the extent of all beings without going anywhere. She had a form
that neither ceased nor came into existence within worlds. She had a form
that did not originate in and was not born in any world. She had a form that
was dedicated to having a quality the same as birthlessness but was also
unceasing. [F.262.a] She had a form that engaged in all conducts within the
world and was truly perceived.
 She had a form that was not real but was
perceived by the world.
 She had a form that was not false and did not
pass away.
 She had a form that transcended death and birth and was
indestructible. She had a form that had the indestructible nature of the realm
of the Dharma and had no characteristics. She had a form that mastered the
languages of the three times and had a single characteristic. She had a form
that came forth with the excellent characteristic
 of the absence of
characteristics and was like a reflection. She had a form that was perceived
by all beings in accordance with their motivations and aspirations and was
like an illusion. She had a form that was created by the illusion of wisdom

and was like a mirage. She had a form that was intent on being present
 in
the perception of beings in each instant
 and was like a shadow. She had a
form that followed beings in accordance with her past prayers and was like a
dream. She had a form that was perceived separately by beings according to
their dispositions and was active in the entire realm of phenomena. She had
a form that had a pure nature like the realm of space and arose from great
compassion. She had a form that was dedicated to protecting all the classes
of beings and arose through the gateway of the absence of attachment. She
had a form that pervaded in each instant the entire realm of phenomena and
had no end or middle. She had a form that was dependent on all beings
without being polluted by them and was immeasurable. She had a form that
transcended all words and had no location. She had a form that was an
accomplished presence
 that guided all beings and had no presence.
She had a form that through its presence was dedicated to benefiting beings
and did not occur.
 She had a form that was created through the conjured
illusion of prayer and was unsurpassable. She had a form that was above all
worlds and was not what it seemed to be. [F.262.b] She had a form that was
perceived through the light of śamatha and was without origin. She had a
form that followed beings in accordance with their karma and accomplished
the prayers to fulfill the wishes of all beings like the king of wish-fulfilling
jewels, without thought. She had a form that was present in accordance with
the conceptions of all beings and, having no thought, was nonconceptual.
She had a form that was perceived by all beings and was without
impediment. She had a form that was dedicated to turning beings away from
saṃsāra and was completely pure. She had a form that, like the true nature,
was without conceptualization and had that kind of mode. She had a form
that appeared as form without having form and was without sensation. She
had a form that was dedicated to the cessation of the sensations of worldly
suffering and was above all the conceptualizations of beings. She had a form
that was perceived by the perceptions of all beings and arose through the
nature of not being formed. She had a form that occurred through the quality
of illusory conjuration and transcended being an object of consciousness.
She had a form that arose from the wisdom of bodhisattva prayer and had no
nature of its own. She had a form that engaged in the languages of all beings
and dispelled pain.

Through possessing the supreme coolness of the Dharma body, Māyādevī
revealed a form body in accordance with the aspirations of beings. In
accordance with the aspirations of beings, she manifested bodies that
resembled those of all beings and were superior to the form bodies of all
beings.

44. 34
Some beings saw Māyādevī in the form of a daughter of Māra but superior
to the form of a daughter of Māra. [F.263.a]
44. 35
Some saw her as superior through having the form of one of Vaśavartin’s
apsarases.
Some saw her as superior through having the form of one of Sunirmita’s
apsarases.
Some saw her as superior through having the form of one of Saṃtuṣita’s
apsarases.
44. 36
Some saw her as superior through having the form of one of Suyāma’s
apsarases.
Some saw her as superior through having the form of a Trāyastriṃśa
apsaras.
Some saw her as superior through having the form of a Caturmahārājika
apsaras.
44. 37
Some saw her as superior through having the form of a daughter of a lord
of kumbhāṇḍas.
Some saw her as superior through having the form of a daughter of a lord
of mahoragas.
Some beings saw her as superior through having the form of a daughter of
a lord of humans.
44. 38
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, although devoid of the concepts of the
forms of all beings, was comprehending the thoughts of other beings, and he
saw that in the thoughts of all beings Māyādevī had the merit to care for all
beings; she had a body created by the merit of omniscience; she was
inseparable from the practice of the perfection of generosity; she engaged
equally with all beings; she gathered all beings into the enclosure of great
compassion; she manifested from the practice of all the qualities of the
tathāgatas; she had entered an ocean of all the ways of patience; she
increased mentation
 through the power of the diligence of omniscience;
she possessed the constant diligence that purified the entire field of
phenomena; she had arisen from the realization of the nature of phenomena;
she possessed a mind that had accomplished all the ways of the branches of
dhyāna; [F.263.b] she had attained the illumination of the field of dhyāna of
the tathāgatas that possesses the undifferentiated range of the branches of
dhyāna; she dwelled in various realizations of how to definitively dry up the
ocean of the kleśas of all beings; she had skill in the way of differentiating
the Dharma wheels of all tathāgatas; she had the wisdom to analyze the
ocean of all the ways of the Dharma; she never had enough of seeing all the
tathāgatas; she had the continuous vision of the successions of the
tathāgatas in the three times; she faced the gateway to seeing all the
buddhas; she was skilled in the different ways of purifying the path
1891

accomplished by all the tathāgatas; she had the field of activity of the
tathāgatas, which is as extensive as space; she was skilled in the ways of the
method of gathering all beings; she had appearances that ripened and
guided the vast extent of beings, without end or middle, in accordance with
their aspirations; she comprehended the different pure bodies of all
buddhas; she had the prayer to purify the ocean of all realms; she had the

she had a mind that generated the strength of the Dharma; she had attained
the illumination of the strengths of the buddhas; she had perfected the
strength of all the powers of a bodhisattva; she had developed the strength
of the power of omniscience; she had illuminated wisdom with the lightning
of the wisdom of the tathāgatas; she was skilled in examining the ocean of
the minds of the vast, centerless, endless extent of beings; she
comprehended the aspirations of the multitudes of beings; she was skilled in
the ways of knowing the different capabilities of other beings; she had

44. 39
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw Māyādevī in those ways and in
other ways as numerous as the atoms in Jambudvīpa.
44. 40
Having seen that, he blessed his own body to be as numerous as those of
Māyādevī and bowed down to them with bodies that spread among them all.


---

44. 41
The instant he bowed down, he attained a vast extent, without middle or
end, of entrances to samādhi. He looked upon those entrances to samādhi,
identified their characteristics, meditated on them, devoted himself to them,
remembered them, pervaded them, made them vast, viewed them, increased
them, accomplished them, and sealed them.
44. 42
He arose from those entrances to samādhi and circumambulated
Māyādevī and her entourage, keeping her to his right, and their residence
and seats. Then he stood before her with hands together in homage and
said, “Āryā, through Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta I have developed the aspiration
for the highest, complete enlightenment and was inspired to honor the
kalyāṇamitras. In that way, I have honored one kalyāṇamitra after another
and have finally come to your feet.
44. 43
“Āryā, how does a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct and
accomplish omniscience?”
Māyādevī answered, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva
liberation called the display of the illusory conjurations of wisdom of the great
prayers.
44. 44
“Noble one, through possessing that liberation, I have become the mother
of each one of all the bodhisattvas in their final existences who are the
Bhagavat Vairocana’s miraculous manifestations of being born into the final
existences of a bodhisattva in all the Jambudvīpas in all the world realms in
this ocean of world realms. [F.265.a] All those bodhisattvas have resided in
my belly and emerged from the right side of my belly.
44. 45
“Noble one, in the location of the great city of Kapilavastu in this fortunate
four-continent world, as a queen in the family of King Śuddhodana, I gave
birth to the bodhisattva Siddhārtha in an inconceivable, vast, miraculous
manifestation of a bodhisattva’s birth.
44. 46
“Noble one, while I was living in the palace of King Śuddhodana, the time
came for the bodhisattva to leave Tuṣita. From all his pores, from each of his
pores, shone many light rays, as numerous as the atoms in countless buddha
realms, called the illumination that comes from the field of the qualities of the mothers
of all tathāgatas, which were a display of the qualities of the mothers of all
bodhisattvas. They illuminated all world realms and shone upon me,
spreading through me from the crown of my head to all the pores of my
body.
44. 47
“Noble one, in that way, the bodhisattva light rays with one name
radiated various miraculous manifestations, displays, and liberations of the
mothers of bodhisattvas. The instant that they entered my body, I perceived
in my body the displays and modes of the miraculous births of all
1892


---

bodhisattvas, visible in the fields of the tips
 of the light rays from the
bodhisattva. Their residences and their entourages also appeared in that
way. [F.265.b]
1893
44. 48
“Noble one, in that way, the instant those light rays from the bodhisattva
entered my body, the field of the tips of the light rays from the bodhisattva
made visible to me the miracles and modes of the lives of bodhisattvas, and I
saw them all. I saw them all going to their bodhimaṇḍas, sitting on their lion
thrones encircled by assembled entourages of bodhisattvas, encircled by
lords of the world, and turning the wheel of the Dharma.
44. 49
“I also saw those tathāgatas performing bodhisattva conduct in the past,
all their service to tathāgatas, their first development of aspiration to
enlightenment, the miracles of their birth, their complete enlightenment,
their turning the wheel of the Dharma, the miraculous manifestation of their
passing into nirvāṇa, and the display of their pure buddha realms.
44. 50
“I also saw all the field of the emanations of those tathāgatas filling all the
realms of phenomena in each instant.
44. 51
“Noble one, in that way, the instant those light rays from the bodhisattva
entered my body, my own body became superior to those of all beings. My
womb became as vast as space, but my body did not appear to transcend
being a human body.
44. 52
“All the displays and residences of the wombs in which dwelled
bodhisattvas in the ten directions appeared contained within my body.
44. 53
“Noble one, in that way, there appeared in my body the wombs in which
the bodhisattvas resided, together with their residences and their
enjoyments. [F.266.a] In that instant, the bodhisattva and bodhisattvas as
numerous as the atoms in ten buddha realms who had the same prayer, the
same practice of conduct, the same roots of merit, the same displays; who
were dwelling in the same liberation, residing on the same level of wisdom,
coming forth through the same miraculous manifestations, accomplishing
the same prayers, coming forth through the same conduct; having purified
Dharma bodies and the powerful presence of a vast, centerless, endless
extent, of form bodies coming forth through the completely good
bodhisattva conduct, prayers, and miraculous manifestations, were seated in
the center of the precious kūṭāgāras of the lords of nāgas. The nāga king
Sāgara and eighty thousand other nāga kings and all lords of the world
made offerings to them.
44. 54
“They displayed the miraculous manifestations of passing away from all
the Tuṣita palaces, displayed taking birth from each Tuṣita into a four-
continent world throughout all the world realms, acted in accordance with
their skill in the inconceivable methods for ripening beings, inspired beings
who were careless, brought them up out of all attachments, spread a great


---

network of light rays that dispelled the darkness in all worlds, ended the
sufferings in all lower existences, prevented all existences in hells, invoked
the past karma of all beings, [F.266.b] protected all realms of beings, and
displayed their bodies to all beings.
44. 55
“Together they departed from their Tuṣita palaces and with their
entourages entered my body. All of them moved and walked within my
body, their steps ranging from being as wide as a great world realm of a
thousand million worlds up to being as wide as world realms as numerous
as the atoms in countless buddha realms.
44. 56
“The countless assembled entourages of bodhisattvas at the feet of
tathāgatas in all the vast extent of world realms in the ten directions in each
instant came into my body in order to see the miraculous manifestation of
the bodhisattva’s residence in the womb.
44. 57
“The Four Mahārājas, Śakra, Suyāma, Saṃtuṣita, Sunirmita, Vaśavartin, the
lords of the devas, and the lords of Brahmā devas also entered in order to see
the bodhisattva dwelling in a womb, to pay homage to him, honor him, and
hear him speak the Dharma. My womb, although it held all those assembled
entourages, did not become vast. My body was not different from an
ordinary human body, and yet it held all those assembled entourages.
44. 58
“All those devas and humans saw the bodhisattva’s various pure
enjoyments and displays. Why is that? Because I meditated on this
bodhisattva liberation called the illusory conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer.
44. 59
“Noble one, just as I held in my body the bodhisattva in the Jambudvīpa of
this fortunate four-continent world, [F.267.a] in the same way I have held
him in this miraculous manner in all the four-continent worlds of the great
world realm of a thousand million worlds. Because I have meditated on this
bodhisattva liberation called the illusory conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer,
my body is neither dual nor nondual, and it is neither single nor multiple.
44. 60
“Noble one, just as I have been the mother of this Buddha Vairocana, in
the same way I have been the mother of a vast extent, without middle or end,
of past tathāgatas. If a bodhisattva was born miraculously from the center of
a lotus, I was a goddess of that lotus bed, I acquired that bodhisattva, and I
was known in the world as being the bodhisattva’s mother. If a bodhisattva
was born upon my lap, I acquired them from my lap and was the
bodhisattva’s mother. If a bodhisattva were in that way born spontaneously
in a buddha realm, I would be living there as the goddess of the
bodhimaṇḍa.
44. 61
“Noble one, through various methods I became the mother of the
bodhisattvas when they appeared in various ways in the world as their last
existence as bodhisattvas.


---

44. 62
“Noble one, in this world realm I have been the mother who manifested
the miraculous bodhisattva birth of the Bhagavat Vairocana. In the same
way, I was the mother of the tathāgatas Krakucchanda, Kanaka muni, and
Kāśyapa. In the same way, I will be the mother of all the future tathāgatas in
this Bhadra kalpa. [F.267.b] Thus, when the time comes for the bodhisattva
Maitreya, who dwells in the Tuṣita palace, to manifest passing away, he will
radiate the light ray of the lights that reveal the miraculous event of the birth,
appearance, and dwelling in a womb of all bodhisattvas. The light will go
throughout the lands and ways of the entire realm of phenomena and will
manifest as that bodhisattva Maitreya who will be born in a human world in
the family of a lord of humans in all the lands and ways of the entire realm of
phenomena in order to guide beings, and I will be the mother of all those
bodhisattvas.
44. 63
“Just as I will be the mother of the bodhisattva Maitreya, in the same way,
after Maitreya’s attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment of
buddhahood, I will be the mother of Siṃha, Pradyota, Ketu, Sunetra,

such as Maitreya and the others I have mentioned, and all the other
tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddhas of this Bhadra kalpa in this great world
realm of a thousand million worlds.

“As it is in this world realm, I will in the same way enter countless world
realms in the ten directions throughout the vast extent, without middle or

44. 66
“In the same way that I will be the mother, with countless special
qualities, of the Tathāgata Maitreya, [F.269.b] I will be the mother, with
countless numbers of countless special qualities, of the Tathāgata Siṃha,
and so on until the Tathāgata Roca.
44. 67
“Just as I am the mother of the tathāgatas of the Bhadra kalpa, in the same
way, in all the Jambudvīpas in all the world realms in the entirety of this
ocean of world realms called Kusuma tala garbha vyūhālaṃkāra, and in all the
world realms throughout the vast extent of world realms, until the last of
future kalpas, I will practice the completely good conduct of the bodhisattva
and be present in all kalpas in order to ripen and guide beings, and I will be
the mother of all the tathāgatas as bodhisattvas in the future.”
44. 68
After she had spoken, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, asked
Māyādevī, “Āryā, how long has it been since you attained this bodhisattva
liberation called the illusory conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer?”
44. 69
Māyādevī answered, “Noble one, in the past, in time gone by, countless
kalpas ago, beyond the scope of the mind, beyond kalpas that are beyond
the number that can be perceived and known by the vision of wise
bodhisattvas, there was a kalpa called Śubhaprabha. In that Śubhaprabha


---

kalpa there was a world realm called Merūdgataśrī, which was both pure
and defiled, formed from many jewels, and endowed with Cakravāla
mountain ranges, Sumeru mountains, and oceans, the five classes of beings,
and a variety of beauties. In that Merūdgataśrī world realm there were ten
thousand million four-continent worlds. [F.270.a] In the center of those ten
thousand million four-continent worlds was the central four-continent world
called Siṃha dhvajāgra tejas. In that four-continent world there were eighty
thousand million royal cities. In the center of those eighty thousand million
royal cities there was the central royal city, called Dhvajāgravatī, in which
there was a cakravartin king called Mahā tejaḥ parākrama. By that royal city of
Dhvajāgravatī there was a bodhimaṇḍa called Citra mañjari prabhāsa, where
dwelled a bodhimaṇḍa goddess by the name of Netraśrī.
44. 70
“In that bodhimaṇḍa called Citra mañjari prabhāsa, the bodhisattva Vimala-
dhvaja sat in order to realize omniscience. In order to prevent his realization
of omniscience, a māra by the name of Suvarṇaprabha, together with an
entourage of a great army of māras, made himself visible
 and came before
him.
1907
44. 71
“The cakravartin Mahā tejaḥ parākrama had attained the power of a
bodhisattva and displayed manifestations of great miraculous powers. He
manifested a great army that was far more numerous than the māra’s army,
and in order to defeat the māra’s army, it surrounded the bodhimaṇḍa and
scattered the great army of the māra. Then the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata
Vimala dhvaja, attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood.
44. 72
“Netraśrī, the bodhimaṇḍa goddess, looked upon the cakravartin king
Mahā tejaḥ parākrama as her son. [F.270.b] She bowed to the feet of the
Bhagavat and made this prayer: ‘Bhagavat, wherever I am reborn, may the
cakravartin Mahā tejaḥ parākrama always be my son! May I be his mother
when he attains the highest, complete enlightenment at buddhahood.’
44. 73
“She dwelled at the Citra mañjari prabhāsa bodhimaṇḍa serving a trillion
tathāgatas during the Śubhaprabha kalpa.
44. 74
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was
Netraśrī, the bodhimaṇḍa goddess? Noble one, do not think that it was
anyone else, for at that time, in that time, I was Netraśrī, the bodhimaṇḍa
goddess.
44. 75
“What do you think, noble one? At that time, in that time, who was the
cakravartin king Mahā tejaḥ parākrama, who had attained the power of a
bodhisattva, displayed manifestations of great miraculous powers, and
scattered the army of that māra? Do not think that it was anyone else, for at
that time, in that time, the Tathāgata Arhat Samyak saṃbuddha Vairocana
was Mahā tejaḥ parākrama, the cakravartin king.


---

44. 76
“Noble one, in that way, from that time onward, wherever I was reborn, in
all those lives he has been my son. Wherever he was reborn, practicing
bodhisattva conduct in all buddha realms, in all the entrances to roots of
merit, in all the ways of bodhisattva conduct, [F.271.a] in all the ways of
rebirth, in all lifetimes as a lord of devas, as a lord of the world, on the level of
a supreme deity, as a light among the classes of beings, wherever he was
reborn in order to ripen beings, in all those lifetimes I was his mother. In all
existences I have inseparably been his mother. I have been his mother in all
the miraculous bodhisattva births manifested in each instant through the
gateways of bodhisattva births.
44. 77
“I have been the mother of the immeasurable vast extent, without middle
or end, of the tathāgatas of the past. I am the mother of the immeasurable
vast extent, without middle or end, of the tathāgatas in the ten directions
who have appeared in the present time. In that way, I have been the mother
of a bodhisattva for all tathāgatas in their final lifetime, and from the navel of
all those tathāgatas shone many light rays that illuminated my body and
mind.
44. 78
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the illusory
conjurations of the wisdom of great prayer. How could I know or describe the
qualities of the bodhisattvas who possess the essence of great compassion,
who within themselves are never satisfied in ripening and guiding beings to
omniscience, and who manifest from the tips of their body hairs the
miraculous manifestations of all tathāgatas?
44. 79
“Depart, noble one. In the paradise of the lord of Trāyastriṃśa resides
Surendrābhā, the daughter of the deva Smṛtimat. [F.271.b] Go to her and ask
her, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in and practice bodhisattva conduct?’ ”
44. 80
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of
Māyādevī, circumambulated her many hundreds of thousands of times,
keeping her to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed from
Māyādevī. [B17]

Chapter 45
SURENDRĀBHĀ
45. 1
Sudhana went to the paradise of the lord of Trāyastriṃśa and approached
the deva maiden Surendrābhā, the daughter of the deva Smṛtimat. He bowed
his head to the feet of the deva maiden Surendrābhā, circumambulated the
deva maiden Surendrābhā many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping
her to his right, and then stood before the deva maiden Surendrābhā with his
palms together in homage and said, “Āryā, goddess, I have developed the
aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how
bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
should practice it. Āryā, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings
to bodhisattvas! I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train
in bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!”
45. 2
When he had said that, the deva maiden Surendrābhā said to Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation
called the display of pure, unimpeded memory.
45. 3
“Noble one, I remember a kalpa called Utpala in which I served as many
tathāgatas as there are grains of sand in the Ganges River. [F.272.a] When
they set forth, I protected them, made offerings to them, and gave them
parks to enjoy.
45. 4
“I know when those buddha bhagavats were bodhisattvas, were within

“Why should you do that? Noble one, the bodhisattva Maitreya has
understood all bodhisattva conduct, he has comprehended the minds and
thoughts of all beings, he has followed the conduct of all beings, he is
focused on ripening and guiding all beings, he has completed all the
perfections, he dwells on all the bodhisattva bhūmis, he has attained all the
patience of a bodhisattva, he is free of the defects of a bodhisattva, he
possesses all the prophecies of a bodhisattva, he delights in all the
liberations of a bodhisattva, he has acquired all the blessings of the buddhas,
and he has been empowered by the empowerment of the range of
omniscience of all the tathāgatas. [F.281.a]

“Noble one, that kalyāṇamitra will saturate you with roots of merit, he will
increase your aspiration for enlightenment, he will make the element of your
superior aspiration stable, he will purify all your roots of merit, he will
increase the force of your bodhisattva powers, he will reveal the unobscured
direction of the Dharma, he will make you realize the understanding of all
the bhūmis that are entered, he will make you enter the gateways to the
arising of the prayers of all bodhisattvas, and he will show you the gateway
to the arising of the attainment of the completely good bodhisattva conduct.

“Noble one, do not be attached to one root of merit! Do not be devoted to
one illumination from the light of a Dharma gateway! Do not be dedicated to
accomplishing one prayer! Do not continuously follow through one
prophecy! Do not have the perception that three kinds of patience are
enough! Do not continually bring to completion six perfections! Do not make
attaining ten bhūmis the ultimate goal! Do not aspire to possess and purify a
measurable number of buddha realms! Do not be satisfied by rejoicing in and
serving a measurable extent of kalyāṇamitras!

their roots. All the firm developments of the aspiration to enlightenment of
the bodhisattvas arise from the kalyāṇamitras. The kalyāṇamitras are the
guides to all the light from the doors to
 the mental retention and
eloquence of bodhisattvas. The kalyāṇamitras possess all the treasures of the
doors to the purity of the bodhisattvas. The kalyāṇamitras give rise to all the
light of the knowledge of the bodhisattvas. The kalyāṇamitras hold in their
hands all the special prayers of the bodhisattvas. The single family of the
way of the prayers of bodhisattvas is dependent on the kalyāṇamitras.

of the aspirations and superior motivations of bodhisattvas is described by
the kalyāṇamitras. All the strength of the great love of the bodhisattvas
comes from the kalyāṇamitras. [F.285.a] All the strength of the great

thoughts of the kalyāṇamitras do not transgress the trainings. The
bodhisattvas guarded by kalyāṇamitras do not fall into the hands of bad
companions. The bodhisattvas protected by kalyāṇamitras do not lapse from
the Dharma of the bodhisattvas. The bodhisattvas being cared for by
kalyāṇamitras transcend the level of ordinary beings. The bodhisattvas
guarded by kalyāṇamitras do not engage in the faults of the śrāvakas and
pratyeka buddhas.
 The bodhisattvas protected by kalyāṇamitras rise
above the world. The bodhisattvas created by kalyāṇamitras are unstained
by worldly qualities. The bodhisattvas who serve the kalyāṇamitras practice
a conduct free of confusion. [F.285.b] The bodhisattvas accomplished by
kalyāṇamitras do not turn away from all undertakings. The bodhisattvas in
the care of kalyāṇamitras are invincible to karma and kleśas. The
bodhisattvas who are reliant on the strength of the kalyāṇamitras are
invulnerable to all māras. The bodhisattvas who remain dependent on
kalyāṇamitras increase all the aspects of enlightenment.

superior motivation toward the kalyāṇamitras, is practicing all the
instructions of the kalyāṇamitras, all the bodhisattva’s roots of merit will

Himalayas. The bodhisattva becomes a container of all Dharmas just as the
great ocean is a container of water. The bodhisattva becomes the source of
many qualities just as the great ocean is a source of many jewels. The
bodhisattva purifies just as the heat of fire purifies gold. The bodhisattva is
higher than the world just as Sumeru is higher than the ocean. The
bodhisattva is unstained by the worldly qualities just as water does not cling

the ocean does not keep a corpse. The bodhisattva increases good qualities
just like the phase of the waxing moon. The bodhisattva illuminates the

Chapter 54
MAITREYA
54. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, his mind moistened by the instructions of
the kalyāṇamitra, contemplated bodhisattva conduct. Thinking of how his
many bodies in the past had failed to practice perfect conduct, he made
resolute the strength of his body. Thinking of how his body and mind
throughout the past, even though pure, were the worthless continuation of a
saṃsāric mind, he applied the attention of his mind to conduct. Thinking
how his actions throughout the past had been impure, had been devoted to
the world, and were worthless hardships, he contemplated accomplishing in
the present that which is very meaningful. [F.289.a] Thinking how
throughout the past he had developed thoughts through incorrect
examination, he generated the strength to create the correct examination of
bodhisattva conduct. Thinking how his past bodies had a range of
activity
 dedicated to engaging in self-benefit, he made firm the strength
of his superior, higher motivation to engage in benefiting
 all beings.
Thinking how in the past he had the flavorless conduct of continually
seeking what was desired, he increased the great force of the power for
attaining relief through engaging in obtaining the Dharma of the buddhas.
Thinking how in the past he had engaged in conduct through an incorrect
motivation, he purified
 the flow of his mind in the present with a correct
view that was free of error and with dedication to bodhisattva prayer.
Thinking how in the past he fruitlessly had no diligence in his undertakings
and practiced without diligence, in the present he motivated his mind and
body by generating the diligence for remaining prepared to gather the
Dharmas of the buddhas. Examining how he and others had been lost in the
lower realms and
 the five classes of beings, and thinking how in the past
he had not taken care of his body, he increased a vast, powerful rejoicing
1973
1974
1975

---

and aspiration for maintaining a body with the power to accomplish all the
Dharmas of the buddhas, take care of all beings, and serve all kalyāṇamitras.
[F.289.b]
54. 2
He looked upon the body he had attained at that present time as the basis
for illness, death, and misery, as a treasure that comes together and comes
apart, and as the cause and condition for dedication to the practice of
bodhisattva conduct until the last future kalpa; for dedication to ripening
beings and possessing
 the Dharma of the buddhas; for dedication to
seeing the tathāgatas, going to all realms, venerating all dharmabhāṇakas,
and acquiring the teachings of all the tathāgatas; for help in the search for all
Dharmas; for dedication to seeing all kalyāṇamitras and gathering all the
Dharma of the buddhas; and for bodhisattva prayers and a body of
wisdom.
 Thus he increased the inconceivable power and force of his
roots of merit.
1977

54. 3
With such a motivation, such thoughts, and such fundamental dedication,
with the faith that is created by the belief of all bodhisattvas, with the regard
that is created by the aspirations of all bodhisattvas, with the respect that is
created by the higher motivation of all bodhisattvas, with the reverence that
is created by the power of the belief of all bodhisattvas, with the strength of
the power of belief that is created by the aspiration to buddhas
 by all
bodhisattvas, with the mind’s belief that comes forth from the veneration of
all bodhisattvas, with the accumulation of roots of merit that arise from the
faith of all bodhisattvas, [F.290.a] with the different kinds of offerings that are
created from all the activities of all the bodhisattvas, with the body having
the hands placed together in homage in the same way as that of all
bodhisattvas, looking with the different kinds of vision of the bodies of all
beings, with the equality of the Dharma of all who are designated as
bodhisattvas for all who are designated as beings, with countless designated
bodies bowing and paying homage that come from the miraculous
manifestations through the prayers of all bodhisattvas,
 with the
accomplishment of the display of recited praises that come from the aspects
of the voices of all bodhisattvas, filled with the blessing of all the
bodhisattvas in the past and present,
 with the direct perception of the
residence of the tathāgatas, with the all-pervading enlightenment
miraculously manifested by the tathāgatas and bodhisattvas, following the
bodies of all bodhisattvas pervading nothing greater than a single hair, with
the perception illuminated by the higher cognition that conceives of the pure
path of vision of all bodhisattvas, with the mental āyatana that follows all the
different networks of the directions, with the strength that accomplishes the
prayer that pervades all the different surfaces in the realm of phenomena,
with the gateways for entering all the Dharma pervading everywhere to the

ends of the realm of space, continuously and with no difference in the three
times, with the strength of entering faith and aspiration, and with the
illumination of the instructions of the kalyāṇamitras spreading into the
directions reaching the shore of the ocean of realms, [F.290.b] Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, in that way, with a mind following such a perception
of respect, veneration, offering, praise, homage, the blessing of seeing, and
prayer, with the eyes of wisdom that comprehended such a level of the
immeasurable field of activity of wisdom, prostrated himself at the door of
the great kūṭāgāra called Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha.
54. 4
In that way, for a moment he examined that kind of accomplishment and,
through the power of accomplishment through the higher motivation and
prayer that arise from aspiration and faith, was empowered to continuously
be at the feet of all the tathāgatas.
54. 5
In the same way, he was empowered to be directly before all bodhisattvas,
before the locations of all kalyāṇamitras, before all the caityas of the
tathāgatas, before all the statues of the tathāgatas, before all the palaces of
the buddhas and bodhisattvas, before all the locations of the precious
Dharma, and before the locations and caityas of all śrāvakas and pratyeka-
buddhas. He was continuously and directly present in all the gatherings of
beings up to the gatherings of the āryas, in the places of offering, and before
gurus and parents, through the way of undifferentiated wisdom bodies
going everywhere with empowered perception and empowered by the
mental activity of wisdom.
54. 6
Just as there were those perceptions at the door of the great Vairocana-
vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra, which have just been described, he was
empowered in the same way to bow down and pay homage throughout the
entire realm of phenomena. He was thus empowered continuously,
throughout the future, by sameness with the extent of the measureless realm
of space, [F.291.a] by sameness with the realm of phenomena without
obscuration, by sameness with reaching the limits of existences, by
sameness with the nonconceptual true nature,

of such an entry into wisdom, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed
down and paid homage at the door of the great Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra-
garbha kūṭāgāra. [F.292.a]
54. 7
Then, for a long time, with his mind saturated by the inconceivable force of
his roots of merit, with well-being of body and mind, he stood at the gateway
of the kūṭāgāra and for a little while gazed unblinking at the Vairocana-
vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra. Then with palms together in homage, he
circumambulated it many hundreds of thousands of times.
54. 8
Then, with his mind inspired by that kind of perception and mentation, he
said these words: “This is the dwelling of those who are present within the
dwelling of emptiness, the absence of characteristics, and the absence of
aspiration; of those who are present within the dwelling of the indivisibility
of the realm of the Dharma; of those who are present within the dwelling of
the imperceptibility of the realm of beings; of those who are present within
the dwelling of the birthlessness of all phenomena; of those who are present
within the dwelling of the locationlessness of all worlds; of those who are
present within the dwelling of the baselessness of all beings; of those who
are present within the dwelling of meditation on all locations; of those who
are present within the dwelling of nondependence on any source of
dependence; of those who are present within the dwelling of nonreliance on
any body; of those who are present within the dwelling of the elimination of

present within the dwelling of the pacification of all kleśas; of those who are
present within the dwelling of the greatest wisdom that eliminates all false
view, craving,
 and pride; and of those who are present within the
dwelling of delighting in the arising of all dhyānas, liberations, samādhis,

those who are present within the dwelling of meditation on the field of
activity of the samādhis of all bodhisattvas.

realm, are present in all realms in order to make offerings to all the
tathāgatas; of those are present in all buddha realms in order to perceive the
displays of all buddha realms without moving from their locations; of those

Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, recited these verses:

“Here is the glorious kalyāṇamitra
 Maitreya, who is pure,

Has attained great compassion, is dedicated to benefiting the world,
Resides on the level of empowerment, is the senior son of the jinas,
And contemplates and resides within the range of perception of the
buddhas. {1}

“This place resembles the abode of all the unequaled
Sons of the jinas who are endowed with great renown,
Are established in the liberation of great wisdom’s range of activity,
And move without impediment through the entire realm of phenomena. {2}

“This is the dwelling of those who have perfected the Mahāyāna, have
ascended through
Their power of self-control,
 generosity, correct conduct, patience, and
diligence,

“This is the dwelling of those who have peace and serenity,
Who know the nature of desire, of anger, and of ignorance —
That thoughts are the cause of their arising and their origin is in error —

“This is the dwelling of those who are skilled in wisdom and method,
Who are wise in their perception of the liberations,

Through entering samādhis in that way,
They reveal the scope of perception of the buddhas. {39}

All as being like reflections. {49}

“From here they know the nature of phenomena,
And similarly of all realms, times,
Kalpas, and complete buddhas, to arise
Without substance or a nature of their own. {50}
54. 65
“Dwelling here, they see the equality of beings,
The equality of the Dharma, and the equality of the buddhas,
And they comprehend the equality of realms and of prayers
And also the equality of the three times. {51}
54. 66
“While constantly remaining in this dwelling,
Some guide hundreds of billions of beings.
Others similarly offer to hundreds of billions of buddhas,
And others are contemplating the Dharma. {52}

“I do not have the ability to describe the aspects
Of the scope of prayer and wisdom of their minds.
Throughout hundreds of billions of kalpas,

“I place my hands together and bow my body down
In reverential homage to this palace
Of those who have no inferiority, are unobscured,
And delight in the supreme field of activity. {54}
54. 69
“I pay homage while contemplating
That senior son of the Jina,
Ārya Maitreya, who has unobscured conduct
And a pure realization that is without compare.” {55}
54. 70
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having praised through these and
countless other praises to the bodhisattvas who dwelled in the great
kūṭāgāra called Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha, bowed down to them,
prostrated to them, gazed reverently upon them, honored them, faced them,
and made offerings to them, and he waited at the door of the great kūṭāgāra
called Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha, hoping to see the bodhisattva
mahāsattva Maitreya and delighting to meet the bodhisattva mahāsattva
Maitreya.
54. 71
Then he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya coming from somewhere else
outside the kūṭāgāra, with a retinue of many hundreds of thousands of
beings and preceded by many lords of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas,
asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas. On his right was Śakra and on his

left Brahmā. The lords of the world were paying homage to him, and he was
encircled and preceded by many hundreds of thousands of brahmins as his
family and friends. Seeing him coming to the great kūṭāgāra Vairocana-
vyūhālaṃkāra garbha, Sudhana, overjoyed, pleased, happy, and content,
looking in the direction of the bodhisattva Maitreya, bowed down,
prostrating with his entire body to the bodhisattva Maitreya in the distance.
[F.298.b]
54. 72
Then the bodhisattva Maitreya looked upon Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, and with his right hand indicated him to his retinue and
recited these verses:
54. 73
“Look upon this one who has a pure motivation,
Sudhana, the child of enduring great wealth.
Seeking the sublime bodhisattva conduct,
This wise one has come before me. {56}
54. 74
“You, who have come from love and compassion, are welcome!
You, who have a vast field of love, are welcome!
You, who have a peaceful, serene gaze, are welcome!
You have not wearied in your practice of conduct. {57}
54. 75
“Come here, you who have a pure motivation —you are welcome!
Come here, you who have an undaunted mind —you are welcome!
Come here, you who have faultless
 faculties —you are welcome!
2012
You, wise one, who do not appear wearied in conduct! {58}
54. 76
“You have come forth to analyze all phenomena.
You have been dedicated to guiding all beings.
You have become established in honoring all kalyāṇamitras.
You, who have enduring, unshakable disciplined conduct, are welcome! {59}
54. 77
“You are welcome, you who have come through the path of goodness!
You are welcome, you who are established on the path of good qualities!
You are welcome, you who follow the path of the jinas!
You, who are not wearied by any path! {60}
54. 78
“Come here, you who have the nature of good qualities —you are welcome!
Come here, you who are saturated by goodness —you are welcome!
You who have an infinite field of activity, you are perfectly welcome!
It is rare to see one such as you among all beings. {61}
54. 79
“You have a mind that sees gain and loss as equal.
You have become free of inferiority, suffering, and infamy.

“Sudhana, go into the presence of Mañjuśrī,
Who has fully attained the field of activity of wisdom,
And ask him about the supreme, excellent good conduct,
And then you will enter that way and practice it.” {171}
54. 189
In that way, Maitreya, who has an unimpeded field of activity,
Saw Sudhana, who was superior through his excellent qualities.
He then showed him to his entire assembly of followers
And described this excellent treasury of his qualities. {172}2039
54. 190
When Sudhana had heard such instructions
And such a sublime teaching as this,
His senses were saturated by the power of joy,
And he streamed with a flow of many tears. {173}
54. 191
There arose a great experience of joy,
His senses were satisfied, and he was spontaneously relieved.
Sudhana stood up with his palms pressed together,
And he performed circumambulations around Maitreya. {174}
54. 192
Through the power of Mañjuśrī there appeared
A precious garland of flowers in Sudhana’s hands,
And there appeared many kinds of delights,
Which were arising from bodhisattva prayers. {175}
54. 193
At that time, Sudhana was filled with joy,
And he joyfully scattered them toward Maitreya.
At that time, Maitreya stroked his head, [F.305.a]
And then he recited this verse: {176}
54. 194
“Well done, well done, Jinaputra Sudhana.
In that manner you remain unwearied.
You will quickly become a vessel for qualities
So that you will be just like me and Mañjuśrī.” {177}
54. 195
When he heard that, Sudhana, filled with joy, recited,
“My meeting this kind of kalyāṇamitra
Would be a rare event even in hundreds of lives!

It is excellent that I have come here today! {178}
54. 196
“Through your excellent blessing, Mañjuśrī,2040
You who have attained the perfection of all qualities,
I have found these rare kalyāṇamitras.
May I soon be together with you!” {179} [B19]
54. 197
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, stood before the bodhisattva
mahāsattva Maitreya with his palms together in homage and said, “Ārya, I
have set out upon the highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know
how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they
should practice it.
54. 198
“Ārya Maitreya, you have been prophesied by all the tathāgatas to be only
one lifetime from the highest, complete enlightenment.
54. 199
“Those who are only one lifetime from the highest, complete
enlightenment have transcended all the established states of bodhisattvas.
They have entered the faultlessness of bodhisattvas. They have completed
all the perfections. They have entered all the gateways to patience. They
have attained all the bodhisattva bhūmis. They delight in all the entrances to
the bodhisattva liberations. They have accomplished all samādhis. [F.305.b]
They have realized all the states of existence of bodhisattvas. They have
attained all the ways of the light of retention and eloquence. They have
gained all the powers of bodhisattvas. They have gathered all the

enlightenment of all the buddhas. They have gained the Dharma treasure of
all the tathāgatas. They possess the treasure of the secrets of all the
tathāgatas. They are the heads of all the secret fields of all bodhisattvas. They
are heroes who alarm all the hosts of the kleśas. They are the guides for
those lost in the wilderness of saṃsāra. They are physicians for those
afflicted by the illness of the kleśas. They are supreme among all beings.
They are lords of all lords of the world.
 They are the most senior among

54. 200
“Ārya, I pray that you teach me how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct, how they should practice it, how practicing
bodhisattvas should attain all the Dharmas of the buddhas; serve the realms
of beings by taking care of them; correctly reach the conclusion of the
commitments that have been made; accomplish the great bodhisattva
conduct that has been undertaken; [F.306.b] bring relief to worlds and their
devas; not deceive
 themselves, beings,
 the Buddha, the Dharma, and
the Saṅgha; not be separated from the family lineage of the buddhas; not
make empty the family of the bodhisattvas; and become holders of all the
ways of the tathāgatas.”

54. 201
The bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya looked at all his assembly of
followers and, indicating Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, said, “Noble
ones, regard how this head merchant’s son has asked me about the
accomplishment of bodhisattva conduct and qualities. Patient ones, this
head merchant’s son, with this kind of diligent undertaking, with this kind
of dedication to a goal, with this kind of aspiring commitment, with this kind
of firm motivation, with this kind of unflagging diligence, with this kind of
unceasing appetite for the Buddha’s Dharma, with this kind of quest for
what is superior, with this kind of conduct as if his hair were on fire, with
this kind of longing to see kalyāṇamitras, with this kind of unwearying
service to the kalyāṇamitras, has sought out all kalyāṇamitras, questioned
them, and honored them. Sent by Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, starting from the
city of Dhanyākara, he has roamed throughout the southern region, asked
questions of a hundred and ten kalyāṇamitras, and finally come before me,
throughout that time proceeding with a superior motivation free of any kind
of weariness.
54. 202
“Noble ones, it is very rare to hear the name, see the body, accompany the
field of activity, or have a conduct equal to that of someone who is, in this
way, established in the Mahāyāna, who has maintained a great commitment,
who has a mind that is disciplined by a great aspiration, who wears the

armor of great compassion, who has the intention to protect all beings with
great love, who is dedicated to the perfection of diligence, [F.307.a] who is
dedicated to protecting the multitude of fellow traveling beings, who is
engaged in freeing beings from the great ocean of saṃsāra, who is a follower
of the great path to omniscience, who is dedicated to making available the
great ship of the Dharma, who is determined to accumulate great Dharma
and precious merit, and who is dedicated to gathering the accumulation of a
great gift of the Dharma.
54. 203
“Why is that? Noble ones, it is because this excellent individual has risen
up in order to protect all beings. He has appeared in order to free all beings
from suffering; in order to eliminate all lower existences; in order to dispel all
inopportune paths; in order that all frightening paths be forsaken; in order to
dispel all the darkness of ignorance; in order that all the wildernesses of
saṃsāra be left behind; in order to repel all the cycles of the existences of
beings; in order to transcend the scope of all māras; in order that all bases of
dependency be risen above; in order that there will be no basis in any of the
classes of existence; in order that beings will be extracted from the swamp of
desire; in order that they forsake desire for pleasures; in order that they cut
through the bondage of views; in order that they eliminate attachment to the
false view of destructible aggregations; in order that they cut through the
noose of conceptualization; in order that they turn away from incorrect
paths; in order to bring down the banner of pride; in order to extract the
splinters of habits; in order to destroy the door of obscurations; [F.307.b] in
order to disintegrate the mountain of obscurations; in order to extract beings
from the net of craving; in order to separate beings from the conduct of
ignorance; in order to bring beings across the great river of existences; in
order for beings to forsake deception and deceit; in order to purify minds of
pollution; in order to eliminate doubt, uncertainty, and hesitation; in order to
bring beings across the great river of ignorance; and in order that beings be
revolted by the faults of saṃsāra.
54. 204
“Noble ones, this excellent individual wishes to provide beings with the
ship of the Dharma in order to take them across the four great rivers. He
wishes to bring those who are sinking in the swamp of wrong views onto
the raised ground of the Dharma. He wishes to bring the light of wisdom to
those enveloped in the darkness of ignorance. He wishes to show the path
of the āryas to those wandering in the wilderness of saṃsāra. He wishes to
give the medicine of the Dharma to those tormented by the great illness of
the kleśas. He wishes to provide the realm of deathlessness to those
oppressed by birth, aging, and death. He wishes to extinguish the three
blazing fires with the water of śamatha. He wishes to bring great relief to
those who are distressed by misery, wailing, unhappiness, and tribulation.

He wishes to give the weapon
 of wisdom to those imprisoned in the
wheel of existences.
 He wishes to give the weapon of wisdom to those
beings in the bondage of wrong views. He wishes to show the gateway to
liberation to those imprisoned in the city of the three realms. He wishes to
reveal the safe direction to those who are going in the direction of danger.
He wishes to bring great relief to those being attacked by the bandits of the
kleśas. He wishes to take by the hand those who are frightened and terrified
by the abyss of the lower realms. He wishes to show the city of nirvāṇa to
those who have been seized by the murderers who are the skandhas.
[F.308.a] He wishes to show escape through the path of the āryas to those
encircled by the serpent of the dhātus. He wishes to bring the illumination of
the light of wisdom to those dwelling in deserted villages. He wishes to
bring those at bad fording places to the correct fording places. He wishes to
show genuine kalyāṇamitras to those who have fallen into the hands of
those who are not kalyāṇamitras. He wishes to bring to the Dharma of the
āryas those who aspire to the field of conduct of foolish Dharma. He wishes
to raise upward those who delight in the house of saṃsāra and bring them
into the palace of omniscience.

“Noble ones, in that way, this excellent individual, with that kind of
intention to save beings, continuously seeks to purify the development of
the aspiration for enlightenment. He never wearies in accomplishing the
Mahāyāna. He is never satisfied in drinking from all the clouds of the
Dharma. He is continuously dedicated to completing all accumulations. He is
dedicated to never abandoning purifying all the gateways of the Dharma. He
never abandons his dedication to performing bodhisattva conduct. He has
unswerving application to accomplishing all prayers. He never has enough
of seeing all kalyāṇamitras. He is never fatigued in serving all kalyāṇamitras.
He correctly holds the teaching of the instructions of all the kalyāṇamitras.
54. 206
“Noble ones, a being in the world of beings who has that kind of prayer
for the highest, complete enlightenment is a rare being. [F.308.b] Therefore,
someone who, in setting out for the highest, complete enlightenment,
accumulates the Dharma of the buddhas with this kind of diligent
undertaking; who seeks the path of the bodhisattvas with this kind of
intense aspiration; who purifies bodhisattva conduct with this kind of
dedication; who serves the kalyāṇamitras through this kind of hardship;
who with this kind of conduct, which is undertaken as if his hair were on
fire, never disobeys the kalyāṇamitras; who practices the instructions of the
kalyāṇamitras by practicing with this kind of firm, superior motivation; who
accomplishes the aspects of enlightenment with this kind of successful
acquisition; who with this kind of disinterest in gain, honor, and fame never
contradicts the nature of bodhisattva aspiration; who with this kind of
2048

renunciation, without attachment to home, possessions, desired delights,
happiness, parents, friends, or anything, seeks the company of bodhisattvas;
and who with this kind of lack of concern for his own body and life aspires
to omniscience —such a being is extremely rare.
54. 207
“Noble ones, no other bodhisattva has appeared in a hundred thousand
quintillion kalpas who has attained and realized the perfection of
bodhisattva conduct and prayer, or has come close to the enlightenment of
buddhahood, or has purified a buddha realm, or has ripened and guided
beings, or has entered the knowledge of the realm of phenomena, [F.309.a] or
has accomplished the perfections, or has spread the net of conduct, or has
perfectly accomplished prayers, or has transcended the activities of the
māras, or has served the kalyāṇamitras, or has accomplished and purified all
bodhisattva conduct, or has perfected the strength of accomplishing
completely good bodhisattva conduct in the way that he has attained and
realized them in this one lifetime.”
54. 208
Then, because of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya having described
the qualities and excellences of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, a
hundred thousand beings, having strengthened their aspiration to the
aspects of enlightenment, said to Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble
one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment in order to bring benefit and happiness to
all worlds, in order to save all the realms of beings, and in order to attain all
the Dharma of the buddhas.
54. 209
“Noble one, it is because you have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment that you have perfectly attained what is to
be attained, you have the perfect attainment of a human life, you live
perfectly in the world of the living, you have pleased the appearance of a
buddha, you have perfectly seen the kalyāṇamitra Mañjuśrī, the continuum
of your mind is an excellent vessel, you are saturated with roots of merit, you
rely perfectly upon good qualities, you have perfectly purified your vast
aspiration and your virtuous motivation, [F.309.b] you are perfectly regarded
by all the buddhas, and, noble one, you have been perfectly accepted by the
kalyāṇamitras.
54. 210
“Why is that? Noble one, the aspiration to enlightenment is like the seed
of all the Dharma of the buddhas. It is like a field because it increases the
good qualities of all beings. It is like the earth because it supports all worlds.

however many qualities of the buddhas there are, they are all qualities of the
aspiration to enlightenment and all perfectly present within it.

the same way, for the bodhisattvas who have within their thoughts and the
continuum of their minds that great king of precious jewels, the accumulation
of all jewels, there will be no situation and no time when even one of all their
roots of merit that have been dedicated to omniscience will be lost. [F.313.b]

“Noble one, if moonlight strikes the great precious jewel called beautified by
the moon,
 it will emit a flow of water. In the same way, if the light rays of

bad existences.

“Noble one, whatever is struck by the light of the great precious sapphire
jewel is transformed into the color of the great precious sapphire jewel. In
the same way, in whatever Dharma the great precious sapphire jewel of the
development of the aspiration to omniscience is practiced, whatever it is
directed toward, and whatever root of merit is dedicated by the development
of the aspiration to omniscience, they all become transformed into the color

“Noble one, even though the precious beryl jewel remains for a hundred
thousand years among impurities, it will not become associated with their
unpleasant smell. Its bright nature remains in that way clear and
unstained.
 In the same way, even though the precious beryl jewel of the

“Noble one, when a priceless precious jewel taken from the great ocean by
a ship comes into the hands of a merchant and he goes into the city, it
outshines even a hundred thousand pieces of glass jewelry. In the same
way, although the priceless great precious jewel of the development of the
aspiration to omniscience is within the great ocean of saṃsāra, it is brought
onto the ship of prayer. Bodhisattvas who have the higher aspiration from
having developed for the first time the aspiration for enlightenment, even
though they have not reached the city of omniscience, when they enter the
city of liberation, they outshine all the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, who

“Noble one, there is the great precious jewel called the king of power.
Even though it is located in Jambudvīpa, it manifests the reflections of the
divine palaces that are the disks of the sun and moon, which are forty
thousand yojanas distant. In the same way, the great precious king of power

source of both the stained and immaculate flowers of enlightenment of
countless devas and humans.

“Noble one, the kind of lovely aroma that arises in one day from cloth or
oil perfumed by the flower of a divine orchid tree does not come in a
hundred thousand days from cloth or oil perfumed by magnolia or jasmine

wisdom of the bodhisattva who has meditated in one lifetime on the
continuum of the aspiration to omniscience spreads into the presence of all
the buddhas in the ten directions. That kind of lovely aroma does not arise
from the immaculate roots of merit and knowledge of the Dharma in the

“Noble one, a student training under a master archer has not gained
mastery of the method of archery but has a training in the art and methods

knowledge has not gained the mastery of the level of omniscience, but
whatever special wisdom of prayer and power of conduct they have is not to
be found among any beings who have not

“Noble one, in learning the art of archery, first there is the preliminary of
learning the stance. In the same way, in the bodhisattva training for the level

motivation of the development of the aspiration to omniscience.

“Noble one, all the illusory manifestations and objects of perceptions
created by a conjurer are accomplished through first focusing on the

“Noble one, all the magic mantras and spells have no form, and there is
nothing to be shown, and yet through the development of an aspiration,
conjured illusions and forms of all kinds manifest. In the same way, the
development of the aspiration to omniscience has no form, and there is
nothing to be shown, and yet just through having the power of aspiration in
the realm of phenomena there is the accomplishment of the manifestation of
the display of qualities throughout the entire realm of phenomena.

“Noble one, a fisherman who eats just a fragment of the fat of a makara
will become freed from fear of all water creatures, and the bite of the makara

“Noble one, Śakra, the lord of the devas, wielding the weapon of the vajra,

development of the aspiration to omniscience defeats the entire host of the
asuras who are māras and adversaries.

“Noble one, a person who drinks the elixir of life will have a very long life,
will not become weak, and will not grow old. [F.321.a] In the same way, the
bodhisattva who drinks the accumulated life-elixir of the development of the
aspiration to omniscience will continue in saṃsāra for countless kalpas
without ever wearying or becoming stained by the defects of saṃsāra.
54. 286
“Noble one, in all preparations of herbal medicines, one first needs water,

“Noble one, in all accomplishment of human goals, there must first be the
faculty of life. In the same way, the bodhisattva must first have the aspiration
to enlightenment in order to acquire all the Dharmas of the buddhas.
54. 288
“Noble one, a person who is deprived of the faculty of life has no power to
perform any action and cannot be brought to life even by parents and a host
of relatives. In the same way, bodhisattvas who are separate from the
development of the aspiration to omniscience will have no power to attain
the wisdom of the buddhas, and all beings cannot bring them to life with the
qualities of omniscience.

“Noble one, not long after a prince has been born, he outshines the
highest ministers who are his seniors through being of noble birth and
sovereignty. In the same way, not long after bodhisattvas have developed
the aspiration for enlightenment, through being born in the family of the
Dharma kings, the tathāgatas, even though they are beginners, through the
sovereignty of the great compassion of the aspiration to enlightenment, they
outshine all the śrāvakas who are their seniors in having practiced celibacy
for a long time.
54. 292
“Noble one, all ministers have to pay homage to a prince, however young
he is and however senior to him they are, and yet the prince does not
disrespect the senior ministers. In the same way, however senior the
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas may be, however long they have been
practicing celibacy, they should bow down to a beginner bodhisattva. Also,
the bodhisattvas should not disrespect the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas.
54. 293
“Noble one, even though a prince is not needed by anyone,
 because he
has the royal title and because of the nobility of his family, none of the king’s
ministers is his equal. In the same way, even though beginner bodhisattvas
are oppressed by result-causing karma and kleśas, they have the title of
having developed the aspiration to omniscience and have the nobility and
greatness of the family of the buddhas, and therefore none of the śrāvakas
and pratyeka buddhas that have reached complete attainment are their
equals. [F.322.a]

“Noble one, a completely pure, precious jewel will appear impure to
someone who has the visual defect of cataracts. In the same way, the nature
of the jewel of the development of the aspiration to omniscience is pure, but
it appears impure to those whose eyes of faith have the defect of the
cataracts of ignorance.
54. 295
“Noble one, when all mantras and elixirs have been gathered together and
prepared, they heal the illness of beings through being touched or seen, or
through being in their presence. In the same way, the body of the prayer and
wisdom of the aspiration to enlightenment is created from all the mantras
and elixirs of the accumulation of roots of merit and of wisdom and method.

Hearing, seeing, being in the presence of, or thinking of someone who
possesses that aspiration to enlightenment heals the illness of the kleśas of

“Noble one, clothing that has the characteristic of duck feathers
 is
unstained by the defect of mud. In the same way, the aspiration to
enlightenment that is the clothing that has the characteristic of duck feathers
is not afflicted by the defect of the mud of the kleśas of saṃsāra.
2114

“Noble one, a wooden figure that has its head shaft will not fall apart but
be able to perform all functions. In the same way, if in the head of the body of
the wisdom of the prayer

power for all bodhisattva activities, and because the body is created from the
wisdom of the prayer for omniscience, it will not fall apart.
2115

“Noble one, a machine that does not have a shaft, even though it
possesses wooden limbs, will not have the power for necessary actions.
[F.322.b] In the same way, if bodhisattvas do not possess the higher
motivation of the aspiration to omniscience, even though they have the
accumulation of the limbs of enlightenment, they will not have the power to
accomplish the Dharma of the buddhas.
54. 299
“Noble one, a cakravartin has the precious black agarwood called essence of
the elephant. As soon as that incense is lit, all four branches of the
cakravartin’s army rise up into the sky. In the same way, all the bodhisattva’s

aspiration to omniscience, rise above all the three realms and fully
accomplish the noncomposite field of activity that is the sky of the wisdom of
the tathāgatas.

“Noble one, diamonds do not come from inferior jewel mines but from
diamond mines or from gold mines. In the same way, the development of the
aspiration to omniscience is like a diamond. It does not arise in the jewel
mines of the lesser roots of merit of the aspirations of beings, but from the
diamond mines of the great compassion that protects beings or from the
great gold mines of the higher focus on the omniscient wisdom.
54. 301
“Noble one, the class of trees called without a root ultimately has no visible
roots, and yet the trees are seen to be covered like a net with branches,
leaves, foliage, and flowers. In the same way, there are ultimately no visible
roots of merit of the development of the aspiration to omniscience, and yet in
all existences in all worlds there appear the extensive flowers of its merit,
wisdom, and higher cognitions, as a net of great prayers. [F.323.a]
54. 302
“Noble one, if a diamond is placed in a poor container, it does not appear
to be beautiful, and a vessel with cracks or holes cannot contain it, only a
vessel in perfect condition. In the same way, the great diamond of the


---

development of the aspiration to omniscience will not have beauty in the
vessels of beings who have weak aspiration, are miserly, have bad conduct,
are malevolent, are lazy, have disrupted mindfulness, or have wrong
understanding. It cannot be contained within beings who are vessels with
unstable minds and who follow erroneous higher motivations, but only in
the precious vessels of a bodhisattva’s higher motivation.
54. 303
“Noble one, a diamond can pierce all other jewels. In the same way, the
diamond of the development of the aspiration to omniscience can pierce and
comprehend all the precious Dharmas of the buddhas.
54. 304
“Noble one, a diamond can cut through and overcome all stones. In the
same way, the diamond of the development of the aspiration to omniscience
can cut through and overcome the stone of false views.
54. 305
“Noble one, even if a diamond is broken, it is superior to all other jewels
and outshines ornaments of gold. In the same way, even if the diamond
jewel of the development of the aspiration to omniscience becomes broken
through one’s following erroneous thoughts, it still outshines the golden
adornments that are the qualities of all śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas.
54. 306
“Noble one, even if a diamond is broken, it will dispel all poverty. In the
same way, even if the diamond jewel of the development of the aspiration to
omniscience becomes broken through not being practiced, it can still dispel
the poverty that is saṃsāra. [F.323.b]
54. 307
“Noble one, however small a diamond element may be, it still has the
characteristic of being able to cut all jewels and stones. In the same way,
however minor the engagement in the diamond element of the development
of the aspiration to omniscience, it still has the characteristic of destroying all
ignorance.
54. 308
“Noble one, a diamond jewel does not come into the hands of lesser
people. In the same way, the diamond jewel of the development of the
aspiration to omniscience does not come into the hands of devas and
humans who have inferior aspiration and poor roots of merit.
54. 309
“Noble one, a person who is not skilled in examining jewels will not know
the qualities of a diamond jewel and therefore will not experience its
qualities. In the same way, a person whose understanding is confused is not
skilled in the qualities of the great diamond jewel of the development of the
aspiration to omniscience and therefore will not experience its qualities.
54. 310
“Noble one, a diamond cannot be dissolved.
 In the same way, the
diamond of the aspiration to enlightenment, which is the cause of
omniscience, cannot be dissolved.
2116
54. 311
“Noble one, the great diamond weapon can only be held by someone who
has the superior powerful strength and might of the great Nārāyaṇa, and not
by another strongman. In the same way, the great diamond weapon of the


---

development of the aspiration to omniscience can only be acquired by a
great bodhisattva whose limitless roots of merit are made firm by the power
of the cause of omniscience, which has superior powerful strength and
might like that of the great Nārāyaṇa. Otherwise, it cannot be held by any
other strongmen, who are the śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas. [F.324.a]
54. 312
“Noble one, a diamond can pierce what no other weapon can pierce,
without itself being damaged. In the same way, wherever the weapons of
the prayers and wisdom of śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas are ineffective in
ripening and guiding beings, or in associating with the suffering that is
experienced during the kalpas of the three times, there the bodhisattva who
wields the great diamond weapon of the development of the aspiration to
omniscience is effective without weariness of mind, and without it being
unendurable, and without being adversely affected by it.
54. 313
“Noble one, a diamond can only be contained in a ground made of
diamond and not in any other place. In the same way, only the strong
diamond ground of the development of the aspiration to omniscience can
contain the diamond of the accumulations of the prayers that arise from a
bodhisattva, so that śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas cannot possess it.
54. 314
“Noble one, the container of the great ocean is the diamond ground that is
solid and without fissures so that water cannot leak through the cracks.
In the same way, the roots of merit of a bodhisattva that rest on the
uncracked ground of dedication of the diamond of the development of the
aspiration to enlightenment will never be exhausted throughout all
existences.
2117
54. 315
“Noble one, the great earth that rests on a foundation of diamond will
never be destroyed and will never degenerate. In the same way, the
bodhisattva prayers that are based upon the solid diamond ground of the
development of the aspiration to enlightenment will never be destroyed and
will never degenerate.
54. 316
“Noble one, a diamond will not rot if immersed in water. In the same way,
the diamond of the development of the aspiration to enlightenment will not
become rotten even if it remains for a kalpa in the water of all karma and
kleśas. [F.324.b]
54. 317
“Noble one, a diamond will not be burned or scorched by the heat of fire.
In the same way, the diamond of the development of the aspiration to
omniscience will not be burned by the heat of the fire of the sufferings of all
saṃsāra and will not be scorched by the burning fire of all the kleśas.
54. 318
“Noble one, when a tathāgata arhat samyak saṃbuddha sits on the
bodhimaṇḍa, overcomes the māras, and attains omniscient buddhahood, no
place can be its location other than the ground that is the diamond center of
a world realm of a billion worlds. In the same way, all the strength, power,


---

and might of the bodhisattvas’ roots of merit from their prayers for the
attainment of the highest, complete enlightenment, their entry into patience,
their attainment of the bhūmis, their completion of the roots of merit, their
receiving their prophecy, their reliance
 on all the accumulations of the
bodhisattva path, their making offerings to all the tathāgatas, and their
holding all the great clouds of the Dharma can only be located on the solid
diamond center of the wisdom of all the prayers for the development of the
aspiration to omniscience, and other beings will not be able to possess it.
2118
54. 319
“Noble one, the development of the aspiration to omniscience has those
qualities and countless others; it possesses an indescribable extent of
indescribable special qualities. [F.325.a] Any being who develops the
aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment possesses the phenomena
of such qualities and will possess them going forward.
54. 320
“Therefore, noble one, you have gained an excellent attainment in
developing the aspiration to the highest, complete enlightenment, and in
order to attain these qualities you have sought bodhisattva conduct.
54. 321
“Noble one, you asked, ‘How does one perform bodhisattva conduct?
How does one practice it?’
“Noble one, go inside the great kūṭāgāra called Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra-
garbha and look! You will then know how a bodhisattva should train in
bodhisattva conduct and, having trained, what kind of qualities will be
accomplished.”
54. 322
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, circumambulated the bodhisattva
Maitreya, keeping him to his right, and then said, “Ārya, open the door of
the kūṭāgāra. I am going to enter.”
54. 323
The bodhisattva Maitreya came in front of the door of the Vairocana-
vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra. With his right hand he snapped his fingers,
and with that sound the door opened.
He said, “Noble son, enter the kūṭāgāra.”
54. 324
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was greatly amazed, and he entered
the kūṭāgāra. The instant he entered, the door closed by itself. He saw that
the kūṭāgāra was vast and immense, many hundreds of thousands of
yojanas wide; [F.325.b] as high as the surface of the sky; in all directions as
vast as space; adorned by countless parasols, banners, and flags; adorned by
countless jewels; adorned by countless hung strings of pearls; adorned by
countless hung strings of jewels; adorned by countless hung strings of red
pearls; adorned by countless hung strings of lion pearls; adorned by
countless lion banners; adorned by countless moons and half moons;
adorned by countless hung silk streamers of various colors; adorned by
countless silk flags of various colors; adorned by the lights of countless
nets
 of strings of jewels; adorned by countless nets of gold strings;
2119


---

adorned by countless streamers of jewels; adorned by countless cords of
gold beautified by jewels; adorned by countless bells with beautiful sounds;
adorned by countless strings of precious tiny bells that made beautiful
sounds when moved; adorned by rains of countless divine flowers; adorned
by countless hung streams of divine garlands; adorned by countless censers
from which flowed the aroma of incense sticks;
 adorned by countless
raindrops of gold dust; adorned by countless nets of upper balconies;
adorned by countless windows; adorned by countless toraṇas; [F.326.a]
adorned by countless pinnacles; adorned by countless mirrors; adorned by
countless precious cornices; adorned by countless precious panels; adorned
by countless pillars; adorned by countless clouds of precious cloths; adorned
by countless precious tree trunks; adorned by countless precious platforms;
adorned by countless precious pathways; adorned by countless precious
canopies; adorned by countless precious floors of various kinds; adorned by
countless precious kūṭāgāra adornments; adorned by countless precious
thrones; adorned by countless precious statues of females; adorned by
countless walkways overhung with precious streamers; adorned by
countless beautifully arranged pillars of banana trees made of Jambu River
gold; adorned by countless statues made of all precious materials; adorned
by countless statues of bodhisattvas; adorned by countless flocks of various
birds singing beautiful songs; adorned by countless precious lotuses;
adorned by countless precious supporting columns; adorned by countless
pools; adorned by countless white lotuses; adorned by countless stairways;
adorned by countless arrangements of daises;
 adorned by countless
various kinds of precious ground; [F.326.b] adorned by countless lights of
great precious jewels; adorned by countless arrangements of all jewels; and
adorned by countless perfect qualities and excellences.
2120
2121
54. 325
He saw within the kūṭāgāra another hundred thousand with this kind of
an array of adornments: adorned by countless precious parasols, banners,
and flags, and so on, adorned by countless perfect excellent qualities.
54. 326
He saw that all those kūṭāgāras were in that way vast, immense, and
immeasurable; were treasuries of space; and had been completely,
beautifully adorned.
54. 327
He saw that these kūṭāgāras were perfectly arranged so that in a single
perception they appeared in the manner of reflections that were separate
from one another, not mingled with one another, and distinct from one
another, and so that they appeared with all of them without exception being
perceived in a single perception.
54. 328
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having seen in that way the
inconceivable field of perception and miraculous manifestations of the
Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra, had great delight, and his


---

enthusiasm and aspiration increased by an immeasurable power of joy,
which saturated his mind and body; his mind was clarified of all
conceptualizations; his mind dispelled all obscurations; he was freed from all
ignorance; he entered the direction of the absence of delusion;
 [F.327.a]
he had hearing that perceived with the unimpeded memory of all sounds; he
had mentation that was free of all confusion; he had the power of
understanding that followed the way of unobscured liberation; he had
eyesight that reached all perceptions without obscuration; and with the
accomplishment of paying homage with his body while facing all directions
he paid homage by prostrating with the full length of his all-pervading body.
2122
54. 329
As soon as Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed down he perceived
that he had entered all those kūṭāgāras through the power of the
bodhisattva Maitreya’s blessing. He saw the many different and various
miraculous manifestations and inconceivable objects of perception inside
those kūṭāgāras. Inside some kūṭāgāras he perceived and comprehended
where the bodhisattva Maitreya first developed the prayer for the highest,
complete enlightenment: his birth into a family, what name he had, what
roots of merit he was inspired to, which kalyāṇamitras inspired him, his
lifespan, the name of the kalpa, and under which tathāgata in a realm with
what kinds of displays and in what kind of assembly he made which
particular prayers.
54. 330
He also perceived himself, during the entire lifetime of that tathāgata and
of those beings, to be at the feet of that tathāgata in that time, [F.327.b] and
he saw all those activities.
54. 331
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya at the time that he first
attained the samādhi of love.

In some, he saw where he practiced conduct; in some, where he completed
the perfections; in some, where he entered the state of patience; in some,
where he ascended the bhūmis; in some, where he gained the displays of
buddha realms; in some, where he obtained the teaching of tathāgatas; in
some, where he attained the patience of the birthlessness of phenomena;
and in some, where he received the prophecy of his highest, complete
enlightenment, and everything about what kind of prophecy he received,
who gave the prophecy, and the length of time that was prophesied.
54. 333
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya being a cakravartin
establishing beings on the path of the ten good actions.

gathering beings through all kinds of happiness; in some, being a Śakra,

Suyāma deva lord, describing limitless qualities to beings; in some, being a

array of emanations of all bodhisattvas to his retinue; in some, being a
Vaśavartin deva lord, displaying to the devas power over all phenomena; in
some, being a Māra, teaching to devas the impermanence of all good fortune;
and in some, being born in the dwelling of the lord of the asuras, teaching
the Dharma to his retinue of asuras in order that they forsake all pride,
arrogance, and conceit, enter the great ocean of wisdom,
 and attain the
illusory powers
 of the wisdom of the Dharma.
2123
2124
54. 335
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the realm of Yama, in which the light of the
bodhisattva Maitreya illuminated all the beings in the hells, so that all the
sufferings of the hells ceased for the beings who had been reborn in the
hells.
54. 336
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the realm of the pretas, in which the
bodhisattva Maitreya created much food and drink for the beings who had
been reborn in the preta realms, ending their hunger and thirst.
54. 337
In some kūṭāgāras he saw the worlds of animals, in which through taking
birth in their various kinds of physical existences he guided those beings
who had been reborn as animals.
54. 338

who 
had 
developed 
the 
aspiration 
to
enlightenment for the first time; in some, to those who were engaged in


---

bodhisattva conduct; in some, to those who had attained patience and were
irreversible; and in some, to those who were in their last lifetime and had
been consecrated by the buddhas.
54. 341
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw him describing the particular qualities of a
bhūmi to bodhisattvas who were on the first bhūmi, and in some he saw the
bodhisattva Maitreya discussing all the particular qualities of the bhūmis
with bodhisattvas on all ten bhūmis; in some, he had the completion of all
the perfections; [F.329.a] in some, he had infinite

accomplishment of prayers.
2125
54. 342
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya accompanying
bodhisattvas who followed the same kind of conduct and spoke in
unison
 about engaging, in order to benefit beings, in the various specific
kinds of arts and treatises that bring benefit, happiness, and wealth to all
beings.
2126
54. 343
In some, he saw him speaking in unison
 with bodhisattvas with one
lifetime remaining about entering the gateway of the wisdom consecration
of all the buddhas.
2127
54. 344
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya dedicated to
walking
 for many hundreds of thousands of years.
2128
54. 345
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya dedicated to chanting
the teachings; in some, he was dedicated to examining the gateways of the
Dharma; in some, he was dedicated to discussing the Dharma; in some, he
was dedicated to writing out the Dharma; in some, he was resting in
meditation on love; in some, he was resting in meditation on all dhyānas and
immeasurables; in some, he was resting in meditation on all the āyatana
meditation states and liberations; [F.329.b] and in some, he was resting in
meditation in the samādhi of the method for accomplishing the higher
cognitions of a bodhisattva.
54. 346
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw many bodhisattvas resting in the bodhisattva
samādhi of emanations, and he saw many clouds of all emanations coming
from all the pores of all their bodies.
54. 347
From some of them, he saw many clouds of devas arising from all their
bodies and pores. From some of them, he saw many clouds of nāgas, yakṣas,

emanated beings arising from all their bodies and pores.
54. 348
From some of them, he heard various Dharma gateways coming from all
their bodies and pores, which means he heard the many sounds of entering
all Dharma doors such as the door of praising the qualities of bodhisattvas;
[F.330.a] the door of the perfection of generosity; the doors of the perfections
of conduct, patience, diligence, dhyāna, wisdom, method, prayer, strength,
and knowledge; the doors of the methods of gathering pupils, the dhyānas,
the immeasurables, the samādhis, the samāpattis, the higher cognitions,

54. 349
In some kūṭāgāras, he saw the gathered assemblies of followers of
tathāgatas. He saw the various different births of those tathāgatas, their
different families, their countless different lifetimes,
 their different realms,
their different kalpas, their different teachings of the Dharma, their different
gateways of emanations,
 the different durations of their Dharmas, and so
on, up to all the different forms of their assemblies of followers without
exception. [F.330.b]
2129
2130
54. 350
He saw in the center of the Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha kūṭāgāra one
kūṭāgāra that was greater and vaster than the others and was adorned with
adornments that were greatly superior to all the adornments, without
exception, of all the other kūṭāgāras.
54. 351
He saw within that kūṭāgāra a billion-world world realm. He saw in that
billion-world world realm the billion four-continent worlds and a billion
Jambudvīpas and a billion Tuṣita paradises.
54. 352
He saw within those Jambudvīpas the bodhisattva Maitreya being born
from within a lotus; being taken up by Śakra and Brahmā, walking seven
steps, gazing into the ten directions, and emitting the lion’s roar; manifesting
all the stages of youth; being within the harem; going to the park; turning
toward omniscience; setting forth and entering homelessness; manifesting
the practice of asceticism; eating food; going to the bodhimaṇḍa; engaging
in subjugating the māras; attaining the enlightenment of buddhahood;
gazing without closing the eyes at the Bodhi tree; being supplicated by


---

Mahābrahmā; turning the wheel of the Dharma; and passing away to divine
abodes, which was done through various different manifestations of the
range of attainments of buddhahood, followed by turning the wheel of the
Dharma in different ways, names, and forms, with various different lifespans,
with various different assemblies of followers, [F.331.a] with various
different manifestations of pure buddha realms, with various different
conduct and prayers, with various methods for presenting and teaching the
Dharma and for ripening beings, and with various different manifestations of
the distribution of relics and the power of the duration of the teachings.
54. 353
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, perceived himself to be at the feet of
them all.
54. 354
Through the blessing of the unfailing memory, all the steadfast
knowledge of all those assemblies of followers, all those manifestations of
activities, and all those different lifespans remained within his level of
comprehending knowledge.
54. 355
From all the nets of strings of bells and jingle bells, and from the music
and songs and all other perceived sounds, he heard the inconceivable
thunder from the clouds of the Dharma being emitted.
54. 356
He heard from them all the sounds of all the Dharma just as it had been
previously taught: from some he heard the different kinds of aspiration to
enlightenment; from some, the different kinds of conduct and prayer of the
perfections; from some, the different kinds of countless bhūmis; from some,
the different kinds of miraculous manifestation from inconceivable higher
cognitions; from some, the different kinds of various offerings to the
tathāgatas; from some, the different kinds of displays of buddha realms; and
from some, the different kinds of measureless clouds of the Dharma of the
tathāgatas.
54. 357
From some, he heard the words concerning entering into omniscience:
that in a world realm of such and such a name, [F.331.b] a bodhisattva with
such and such a name hears such and such a Dharma gateway, is inspired by
such and such a kalyāṇamitra, and at the feet of such and such a tathāgata
hears that in a kalpa with a certain name he will be present in a certain realm,
in a certain circle of followers, and having generated certain roots of merit
and having heard of certain buddha qualities will develop a certain
aspiration, and through a certain kind of prayer will develop the aspiration
to enlightenment and will practice bodhisattva conduct for a certain number
of kalpas, and will then attain the highest, complete enlightenment of
buddhahood, when he will have a certain name and a certain lifespan and
have a certain perfection of qualities and arrays of a buddha realm, and
through certain specific prayers will guide beings in a certain way and will


---

gather a certain following of śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, and when he
has passed into nirvāṇa his Dharma will remain for a certain number of
kalpas, and he will thus benefit beings in that way.
54. 358
From some, he heard that in a world realm of such and such a name, a
bodhisattva with such and such a name practices the perfection of
generosity, making a hundred gifts in a certain way of that which it is hard
to give away; that a bodhisattva with such and such a name maintains
correct conduct, meditates on patience, engages in diligence, [F.332.a] rests
in dhyāna, or practices the analysis of wisdom; that a bodhisattva with such
and such a name gives away his kingdom in order to search for the Dharma;
that he gives away his jewels, gives away his children, gives away his wives,
gives away his hands and feet, gives away his head, and jumps into fire; that
a bodhisattva with such and such a name holds the teaching of a tathāgata,
recites the Dharma, makes a gift of the Dharma, makes an offering of the
Dharma, raises the banner of the Dharma, beats the drum of the Dharma,
blows the conch of the Dharma, sends down a rain of the Dharma, holds the
teaching of a tathāgata, adorns the caitya of the Tathāgata, adorns the image
of the Tathāgata, gathers the articles that will bring happiness to beings, and
guards the treasure of the Dharma.
54. 359
From some, he heard that in a world realm of such and such a name, there
resided, lived, and remained a tathāgata with such and such a name,
teaching the Dharma through a consecration with a certain name, to a certain
assembly, in a certain buddha realm, in a certain kalpa, with a certain
lifespan, with certain Dharma teachings, guiding beings in a certain way,
and having attained buddhahood through certain prayers.
54. 360
In that way, he heard from all the perceived networks of bells and jingle
bells, music, and so on the words of countless different kinds of Dharma
doors. On hearing all those words, the mind of Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, became saturated with the vast power of joy [F.332.b] and
attained, through hearing, those Dharma doors. On hearing some, he
attained many doors of eloquence. On hearing some, he attained many doors
of the power of patience. On hearing some, he attained many doors of
conduct. On hearing some, he attained many doors of prayer. On hearing
some, he attained many doors of the perfections. On hearing some, he
attained many doors of the higher cognitions. On hearing some, he attained
many doors of gnosis and knowledge. On hearing some, he attained many
doors of liberations. On hearing some, he attained many doors of samādhis.

defiled pure realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of purified
defiled realms; [F.333.a] in some, the perception of the reflections of world
realms with buddhas; in some, the perception of the reflections of world
realms without the presence of a buddha; in some, the perception of the
reflections of small world realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of
great world realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of narrow
world realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of vast
 world
realms; in some, the perception of the reflections of world realms that were
within magical illusion; in some, the perception of the reflections of world
realms that were sideways; in some, the perception of the reflections of
world realms that were upside-down; in some, the perception of the
reflections of world realms that were level; in some, the perception of the
reflections of world realms that were the abodes of the hell beings, animals,
and pretas; and in some, the perception of the reflections of world realms
filled with devas and humans.
2131
54. 362
He also saw countless bodhisattvas on the walkways and seated
 on
the thrones dedicated to a variety of necessities: some were walking, some
were in meditation, some were looking, some were filled great compassion
for beings, some were composing treatises on various subjects in order to
benefit the world, some were receiving scriptural transmission, some were
chanting it, some were writing it,
 [F.333.b] some were asking questions,
some were dedicated to The Confession of the Three Heaps and to dedication
prayers, and some were accomplishing prayers.
2132
2133
54. 363
He saw many nets of light of all the kings of jewels coming from the
pillars: from some came blue lights; from some, yellow; from some, red; from
some, white; from some, the color of crystal; from some, the color of gold;
from some, the color of sapphire; from some, the colors of the rainbow; from
some, the color of Jambu River gold; and from some, lights in every color;
which brought happiness to the body and mind and were supremely
beautiful.
54. 364
He saw that the pillars of banana trees made of Jambu River gold and the
hands of the statues made of all precious materials were hung
 with
clouds of flowers, and he saw that the hands were hung with wreaths of
garlands; the hands were draped with cloths; the hands held parasols,
banners, and flags; the hands held perfumes, incense, and ointments; the
2134


---

hands were hung with nets of strings of precious jewels;
 the hands were
hung with various jewels on various cords of gold; the hands were hung
with long necklaces of various pearls; the hands were hung with long
necklaces of various jewels; the hands were holding all kinds of adornments.
2135
54. 365
He saw that some were bowing down their topknot jewels and crowns,
staring with unblinking eyes, and paying homage with their palms placed
together.
54. 366
He saw that from the strings of pearls fell a gentle rain of water with the
eight good qualities that had the lovely aroma of various scents. [F.334.a]
54. 367
He saw many shining rows of lamps come from the nets of strings of beryl
jewels.
54. 368
He saw the precious parasols adorned by every kind of adornment and
decoration. He saw their interiors adorned by precious bells, nets of jingle
bells, silk streamers and tassels, precious tablets,
 and eggs
 made of
various kinds of precious jewels.
2136
2137
54. 369
He saw the ponds in which arose countless precious red lotuses, blue
lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses. He saw that some were a hand
span in size, some were a fathom in circumference, some were the size of
carriage wheels, on which were arrayed the adornments of various statues.
He saw that there were statues of women, statues of men, statues of boys,
statues of girls, statues of Śakra, statues of Brahmā, statues of the world
lords, and statues of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas,
kinnaras, mahoragas, śrāvakas, pratyeka buddhas, and bodhisattvas, and
also statues in the form of all beings with their many various colors and
bodies, all arranged paying homage, with their palms together and bowing
their bodies.
54. 370
He also saw statues of tathāgatas adorned with the thirty-two signs of a
great being and sitting cross-legged.
54. 371
He saw that the floor was a great ground made of beryl with a
checkerboard pattern, and within each of the squares there were countless
perceptions of reflections. [F.334.b]
 In some,
 he saw the perception of
reflections of realms; in some, the perception of reflections of bodhisattvas;
and in some, the perception of reflections of buddhas.
2138
2139
54. 372
He saw that reflections of the entire array of the adornments in the
kūṭāgāras appeared in each of the squares.
54. 373
He saw that from out of the entire treasury of the various flowers and
fruits of the precious trees emerged the upper halves of many bodies with
various shapes and various colors. He saw that from some emerged the
upper halves of the bodies of buddhas; from some emerged the upper halves
of the bodies of bodhisattvas; from some emerged the upper halves of the
bodies of devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and


---

mahoragas; from some emerged the upper halves of the bodies of Śakra,
Brahmā, and world lords; from some emerged the upper halves of the bodies
of cakravartins and lords of humans; from some emerged the upper halves of
the bodies of young princes, head merchants, householders, ministers, men,
women, boys, girls, bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās.
54. 374
He saw that some of them had flower garlands hanging
 from their
hands; some of them had strings of jewels hanging from their hands; some of
them had all adornments held in their hands; some were bowing, with palms
together, and gazing with unblinking eyes; [F.335.a] some were praising;
some were resting in meditation; some were the color of gold; some were the
color of silver; some were the color of coral; some were the color of blue
beryl; some were the color of sapphires; some were the color of the radiance
of vairocana jewels; some were the color of magnolia flowers; some had
bodies of light; and some were beautified by the signs of a great being.
2140
54. 375
He saw that from the half moons emerged countless reflections of suns,
moons, planets, and stars.
54. 376
He saw that on all the walls of the buildings, divine palaces, and
kūṭāgāras there were checkerboard patterns made of all jewels.
54. 377
He saw within
 those jewel checkerboard patterns all the bodhisattva
Maitreya’s stages of bodhisattva conduct in his past practice of bodhisattva
conduct; in some of the squares he saw the bodhisattva Maitreya giving
away his head; in some, giving away his eyes; in some, giving away his
hands; in some, giving away his clothes;
 in some, giving away his crest
jewel; in some, giving away his crest jewel of righteousness;
 in some,
giving away his teeth; in some, giving away his tongue; in some, giving
away his ears; in some, giving away his nose; in some, giving away his heart;
in some, giving away his flesh and bone marrow; [F.335.b] in some, giving
away his blood; in some, giving away his skin and panniculus; in some,
giving away his fingernails and toenails with their flesh; in some, giving
away his fingers with their connecting webs; in some, giving away his sons,
daughters, and wives; in some, giving away heaps of jewels; in some, giving
away villages, towns, districts, regions, realms, and royal capitals; in some,
giving away Jambudvīpa; in some, giving away the power of sovereignty; in
some, giving away the royal throne; in some, giving away his male and
female slaves; in some, giving away his harem; in some, giving away his
parks and forest groves;
 in some, giving away parasols, banners, and
flags; in some, giving away flowers, garlands, perfumes,
 and ointments;
in some, giving away healing medicines; in some, giving away much food
and drink; in some, giving away all requisites; in some, giving away all
shelters; in some, giving away white copper
 vessels filled with jewels; in
some, giving away precious carriages; in some, freeing prisoners; in some,

freeing those condemned to death; in some, curing children; and in some,
showing the way to those who were lost; in some, he was a ferryman who
sailed his boat across the river; in some, he was Bālāha, the king of horses,
who saved the beings who had gone to the island of the rākṣasīs
 in the
great ocean; [F.336.a] in some, he was a great ṛṣi who created teaching
traditions; in some, he was a cakravartin who established beings on the path
of the ten good actions; in some, he was a physician who healed sickness; in
some, he was someone who honored his father and mother; in some, he was
someone who revered kalyāṇamitras; in some, he was dedicated to guiding
beings in the appearance and form of a śrāvaka; in some, he was dedicated
to guiding beings in the appearance and form of a pratyeka buddha; in some,
he was dedicated to guiding beings in the appearance and form of a
bodhisattva; in some, he was dedicated to guiding beings in the appearance
and form of a buddha; in some, he ripened beings through manifesting being
reborn in any of the particular births of beings; in some, in the form of a
dharmabhāṇaka, he entered the teachings of a tathāgata, received the
transmission of the teachings, recited the teachings, correctly analyzed them,
adorned the caitya of the Tathāgata, had statues of the Tathāgata made,
inspired beings to make offerings to the Tathāgata, anointed them with
perfumes and ointments, dressed them in bells and garlands, and so on, and
he was dedicated to making offerings to the Buddha and established beings
on the path of the ten good actions, established beings in the five precepts,
the eight poṣadha vows, taking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha,
[F.336.b] entering mendicancy, hearing the Dharma, receiving the
transmission of the Dharma, reciting the Dharma, and contemplating it
correctly; and in order to talk about the Dharma he sat upon a lion throne
and explained the enlightenment of the buddhas.
2147
54. 378
In that way, the bodhisattva Maitreya practiced the six perfections for
countless hundreds of thousands of quintillions of kalpas. Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, saw all of that in various ways within each square of
the checkerboard patterns.
54. 379
He saw in some kūṭāgāras the bodhisattva Maitreya serving as many
kalyāṇamitras as there are, and all the array of miraculous manifestations
that came from that.
54. 380
Sudhana went before all those kalyāṇamitras, and he perceived them
speaking to him and giving an instruction: “Come here, Sudhana! Welcome!
Are you well? Look at this inconceivable range and display of miraculous
manifestations of the bodhisattva!”2148
54. 381
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw in each of the kūṭāgāras, and in
each object of perception, this and other ranges and displays of miraculous
manifestations. Because of his unfailing power of memory, his pure vision,


---

his view of all directions, and his unobscured wisdom of view in vipaśyanā,
he was established on the level of wisdom that comes from the
understanding of a bodhisattva, and therefore he saw all that infinite range
and display of miraculous manifestations. [F.337.a]
54. 382
It was like when a person goes to sleep and in a dream sees many various
particular perceived forms, such as delightful houses and divine palaces;
delightful villages, towns, districts, and regions; delightful parks, gardens,
and forest groves; delightful trees, rivers, pools, and mountains; delightful
clothes, food, drink, and enjoyments; and the enjoyment of the pleasures of
delightful songs, instrumental music, and percussive music. He perceives
himself in the company of his father, mother, friends, family, and relatives.
He sees the great ocean. He perceives Sumeru, the king of mountains, all
divine realms, and Jambudvīpas, in which he himself is many hundreds of
yojanas
 tall. He sees his house and environs as vast. He perceives them
to be adorned with all qualities and adornments. Even though he knows it is
daytime, he cannot tell if that day is long or short, or even know that this is a
dream. He perceives having all things that are pleasant, and he has the
appearance of his composite body being in a state of happiness, not sleeping
and free of all that is unpleasant, experiencing vast joy and happiness. He
thinks this lasts a long time: for a day, a week, a fortnight, a month, a year, a
hundred years, or longer, and when he wakes he remembers it all. [F.337.b]
2149
54. 383
In that way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, through the blessing of
the bodhisattva Maitreya, and through a knowledge that was free from a
limited perception, like that of someone who has entered a dream of the
three realms, was dwelling in the vast, extensive, unobscured perception of a
bodhisattva and possessed the comprehension that could follow the
inconceivable entry into the way of the bodhisattva and comprehend the
scope of the displays of a bodhisattva, and therefore he saw all of those
displays of miraculous manifestations, knew them, experienced them,
examined them, identified them, and beheld them. He also perceived himself
to be present among them.
54. 384
This is like when a sick person is in the final phase of his mind. In the
instant that occurs, his existing karma manifests: there is the ripening of
whatever kind of karma he has accumulated, so that on the basis of bad
karma he sees the hells, birth as an animal, the realm of the pretas, or the
servants of Yama holding menacing weapons and furiously shouting abuse;
he hears the sounds of the wailing and cries of the beings in the hells; he
sees the rivers of acid; he sees the mountains of rows of razor-blade edges,
the iron cotton trees, and the forests of sword blades; and he sees the beings
in hell on fire, burning, being incinerated, and all burning inside one iron


---

pot. [F.338.a] He perceives those harms being inflicted and those sensations
being experienced, and he sees and feels the suffering of the hell beings
being burned by fire.
54. 385
Through good karma he sees the palaces and dwellings of devas: he sees
the retinue of a deva, the groups of apsarases, and all the arrayed
adornments; he sees and experiences parks, forest groves, rivers, ponds,
precious mountains, wish-fulfilling trees, and many enjoyments, and he
perceives them to last for a lifetime.
54. 386
Even though he has not passed away from this world and has not been
reborn elsewhere, because of the inconceivable scope of karma, those kinds
of appearances are not imperceptible but are perceived and experienced.
54. 387
In the same way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, because of the
inconceivable scope of a bodhisattva’s karma, saw all that display of
miraculous manifestations.
54. 388
By analogy, when a person is overpowered by a demon spirit, they will
see many various kinds of forms, and whatever questions they ask, it will
reveal an answer to them. In the same way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s
son, saw all those arrays through the power of the blessing of the
bodhisattva.
54. 389
By analogy, a person who goes into the dwelling of a nāga will enter into a
nāga’s perception [F.338.b] and will have the perception of a day, a week, a
fortnight, a month, a year, or a hundred years passing, but when they
separate from the nāga’s perception, they will see that in terms of human
perception only a moment
 has passed. In the same way, Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, having a mind that maintained the perception of a
bodhisattva and the blessing of the bodhisattva Maitreya, perceived in one
moment many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of kalpas.
2150
54. 390
By analogy, within Mahābrahmā’s divine palace, called Sarva jagadvara-
vyūha garbha, the perceived reflections of all the world realms in the billion-
world universe appear clearly and distinctly. In the same way, Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, saw the arising of all those displays, all those
perceptions, unmixed with one another and unmingled with one another.
54. 391
By analogy, a monk dwelling in the samāpatti of a meditative state of
totality in a singleness without duality, whether in his cell or on a
walkway,
 seated on a seat or standing up, perceives, sees, and
experiences the entire world as the inconceivable scope of his meditation,
the scope of his samāpatti of whichever meditative state of totality. [F.339.a]
In the same way, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw and experienced
those displays according to whatever scope of perception he engaged in.
2151
54. 392
It was like the display and ornamentation of a gandharva city that appears
in the sky, which occurs without any obscuration.


---

54. 393
It was like the palace of a yakṣa being within a human palace, or a human
palace being within a yakṣa palace; they are inseparable but are perceived in
accordance with the purity of the scope of perception of a person’s
karma.2152
54. 394
It was like all the world realms of a billion-world universe appearing upon
a great ocean as reflections on the ocean.2153
54. 395
By analogy, a conjurer manifests all kinds of forms and activities through
the blessings of the power of mantras, spells, and potions. In the same way,
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, saw all the displays of miraculous
manifestations because of the bodhisattva Maitreya’s engagement in
inconceivable conjurations from blessing and wisdom. This was because of
his accomplishment of the power of conjuration from the knowledge of all
phenomena and because of conjuration through a bodhisattva’s power of
blessing and wisdom.
54. 396
Then the bodhisattva Maitreya entered the kūṭāgāra and, diminishing
those blessings, he snapped his fingers, saying to Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, “Arise, noble one!
 Noble one, this is the nature of
phenomena. This is the blessing of the wisdom of a bodhisattva. It is the
characteristic of accomplishment from the practice of all Dharmas. [F.339.b]
They thus have no existing nature of their own. They are like conjurations,
dreams, and reflections.”
2154
54. 397
Then, with that finger snap, Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, arose from
samādhi. The bodhisattva Maitreya then said to him, “Noble one, you have
seen the miraculous manifestations of the blessing of a bodhisattva. You
have seen the power and natural result of the accumulations of a
bodhisattva. You have seen accomplishments through the wisdom of the
prayers of a bodhisattva. You have seen the delightful abodes of a
bodhisattva. You have seen the accumulated conduct of a bodhisattva. You
have heard the doors through which the bodhisattvas come forth. You have
seen the immeasurable qualities and displays of the buddha realms. You
have seen the specific different prayers of the tathāgatas. You have followed
the inconceivable liberation of the bodhisattva. You have experienced the
delight and bliss of the bodhisattva’s samādhi.”
54. 398
Sudhana said, “Ārya, I have seen them through the blessing of the
kalyāṇamitra, through the intention of the kalyāṇamitra, and through the
power of the kalyāṇamitra. Ārya, what is this liberation called?”
Maitreya answered, “Noble one, this liberation is called the essence of the
display of the unfailing memory that engages with the knowledge of all objects of
perception in the three times.


---

54. 399
“Noble one, this
 kind of liberation, which is inexpressibly
inexpressible, is the attainment of a bodhisattva with one lifetime
remaining.” [F.340.a]
2155
54. 400
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, where is this display?”
The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “It is where it comes from.”
54. 401
Sudhana asked, “Where does it come from?”
The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “It comes from the accomplishment
of the blessing of the wisdom of a bodhisattva. It dwells within that blessing.
It does not come or go from anywhere. It does not accumulate. It does not
come together. It does not amass. It has no location as a thing. It has no
location as an object of perception. It has no location in any direction.
54. 402
“By analogy, noble one, the net of clouds of the nāgas is not located in the
body, is not located in the mind, is not located internally, and yet through the
power of a nāga’s mind and through the inconceivable power of a nāga
there is emitted a measureless flow of rain, which is not nonexistent and
appears. In the same way, noble one, those displays are not located
internally and are not located externally, but they become visible through the
power of a bodhisattva’s blessing and through your being a good vessel.
54. 403
“By analogy, noble one, a conjurer displays the entire range of illusions,
but they do not come from anywhere, do not go anywhere, and are not
transferred to anywhere, but through the power of mantra and concoctions,
they are perceived. In the same way, noble one, those displays do not go
anywhere, have not come from anywhere, and are not transferred anywhere,
but they are perceived through having trained in the inconceivable wisdom
conjurations of a bodhisattva and through the power of wisdom and the
blessing of past prayers.”
54. 404
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, from how far have you come?”
The bodhisattva Maitreya answered, “Noble one, the movement of
bodhisattvas has no coming or going; [F.340.b] their motion is without
movement or stillness. Their motion is without basis or location. Their motion
is without passing away or rebirth. Their motion is without remaining or
going elsewhere. Their motion is without movement or rising. Their motion
is without dependence or location. Their motion is without karma or its
ripening. Their motion is without creation or cessation. Their motion is
without permanence or annihilation.
54. 405
“Moreover, noble one, the motion of bodhisattvas is great compassion
because it observes beings to be guided. The motion of bodhisattvas is
great
 love because it saves beings from suffering. The motion of
bodhisattvas is correct conduct because it regards everyone kindly. The
motion of bodhisattvas is prayer because of the blessings of the past. The
motion of bodhisattvas is higher cognition because it manifests itself
 to
2156
2157


---

all. The motion of bodhisattvas has no formation, as there is no movement
from being at the feet of all the tathāgatas. The motion of bodhisattvas has no
acquisition or rejection, because it is not focused on a body or mind. The
motion of bodhisattvas is wisdom and method because it follows all beings.
The motion of bodhisattvas is the manifestation of emanations because it is
like a mirage, a reflection, or an illusory manifestation.
54. 406
“Moreover, noble one, you asked, ‘From how far have you come?’
Noble son, I come here from a hamlet called Kuṭi in the land of the Māladas,
which is the place of my birth.
 In that place there was a head merchant by
the name of Gopālaka. After I had established him in the Buddha’s Dharma,
[F.341.a] I taught the Dharma, in accordance with the nature of the recipients,
to the people of my birthplace. After I had inspired my parents, family, and
relatives
 and brahmins and householders to enter the Mahāyāna, I came
here.”
2158
2159
2160
54. 407
Sudhana asked, “Ārya, where are the birthplaces of the bodhisattvas?”
Maitreya replied, “Noble one, there are ten birthplaces of the bodhisattvas.
What are the ten?
54. 408
(1) “The aspiration to enlightenment is a birthplace of the bodhisattvas
because it is birth into the family of bodhisattvas. (2) The higher motivation is
a birthplace of the bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of
kalyāṇamitras. (3) Being upon the bhūmis is a birthplace of the bodhisattvas
because it is birth into the family of the perfections. (4) The accomplishment
of prayer is a birthplace of the bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family
of bodhisattva conduct. (5) Great compassion is a birthplace of the
bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of all the methods of
gathering pupils. (6) The correct realization of the nature of phenomena is a
birthplace of the bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of the
perfection of wisdom. (7) The Mahāyāna is a birthplace of the bodhisattvas
because it is birth into the family of skillful methods. (8) Ripening beings is a
birthplace of the bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of complete
buddhahood. (9) Method and wisdom are a birthplace of the bodhisattvas
because they are birth into the family of patience from the birthlessness of
phenomena. (10) Noble one, the practice of the Dharma is a birthplace of the
bodhisattvas because it is birth into the family of all past, future, and present
tathāgatas. [F.341.b] Noble one, those ten are the birthplaces of the
bodhisattvas.
54. 409
“Noble one, method and wisdom are the father of the bodhisattvas; the
perfection of wisdom is their mother; the perfection of generosity is their wet
nurse; the perfection of conduct is their nanny; the perfection of patience is
their adornment and jewelry; the perfection of diligence is their growing up;
the perfection of meditation is their correct conduct; the kalyāṇamitras are


---

their training in conduct; all the aspects of enlightenment are their
companions; all the qualities of the roots of merit are their friends; all the
bodhisattvas are their brothers; the aspiration to enlightenment is their
family; their practice is the qualities of their family; being upon the bhūmis is
being in their family; attaining patience is being born into the family;
accomplishing prayer is inheriting the knowledge of the family; pure
conduct is gaining the qualities of the family; inspiring others to the
Mahāyāna is maintaining the continuity of the family; being consecrated as
having one life remaining is being the senior son of a Dharma king; and
attaining becoming a tathāgata is purifying the lineage of the family.
54. 410
“Noble one, in that way, the bodhisattvas transcend the level of different
foolish beings; enter the faultlessness of a bodhisattva; enter the family of
the tathāgatas; are within the lineage of the tathāgatas; practice to maintain
the continuity of the family of the Three Jewels; are dedicated to
protecting
 the family of the bodhisattvas; [F.342.a] make the family and
clan pure; do not cause the vital lineage to decline; have no fault of
transgression in the family that could be criticized by any of the beings in the
world including its devas, its māras, its Brahmā deities, and its śramaṇas and
brahmins; and have the nobility of their family because through being born
in the supreme family of the buddhas they possess a body of great prayer.
2161
54. 411
“Noble one, the bodhisattvas who have such a family lineage know all
phenomena to be like reflections, so they are not revolted by births in all
worlds. Knowing that all births in existences are like magical illusions, they
are born in and remain within the various modes of existence without being
afflicted by them. They have comprehended the absence of a self in
everything and therefore do not become wearied in ripening and guiding
beings. They possess bodies of great love and great compassion and
therefore do not become fatigued in benefiting beings. They have realized
that all saṃsāra is like a dream and therefore do not become disheartened in
remaining in it throughout all kalpas. They know that all the skandhas are
like conjured illusions, and therefore they are not made despondent by all
manifestations of birth, passing away, and death. They have realized the
dhātus
 and āyatanas to have the nature of the realm of phenomena and
are therefore not wounded by anything in the range of sensory possessions.
They meditate on all forms of perception as being like mirages and therefore
have no aspiration for any of the joys of saṃsāra. They play with all
phenomena as being like conjured illusions and therefore are unstained
by any scope of the māras. [F.342.b] They have Dharma bodies
 and
therefore are not brought down by the kleśas. And they have attained power
over rebirth and therefore realize and comprehend all classes of existence.
2162
2163
2164

54. 412
“Noble son, in that way, I have spread throughout the realm of
phenomena with a body that enters birth in all world realms, with the
particular appearances
 that are congruent with the forms of all beings,
with specific definitions that are congruent
 with all beings, with various
names that are congruent
 with all beings, with conduct that is congruent
with the aspirations of all beings, with a conformity to worlds that is
congruent
 with guiding all beings, with the manifestations of lifespans
and births in families that are congruent with the beings who are to be
purified, with gateways of entry into activities that are congruent with all the
conducts of foolish beings,
 with an engagement in knowledge that is
congruent with all the forms of perception of beings,
 and with the
manifestations and splendor
 of bodies that are congruent with all the
emanations from the prayers of bodhisattvas.

54. 413
“Noble one, in order to ripen those beings who in the past practiced in the
same way as I did but lost aspiration for enlightenment, and in order to
manifest a birth and life in Jambudvīpa, I was born in the brahmin castes in
this hamlet called Kuṭi in the lands of the Māladas in this southern region. I
was born here so as to guide my father, mother, family, and relatives, to
dispel arrogance among those in the particular brahmin castes who were
proud of their birth into those castes, and so that they would be born in the
family of the tathāgatas. [F.343.a]
54. 414
“Noble one, in that way, I dwell in this Vairocana vyūhālaṃkāra garbha
kūṭāgāra here in this southern region, ripening and guiding beings in
whatever way is necessary and according to their aspirations through these
kinds of methods.
54. 415
“When I die and pass away from here, I will manifest taking birth in the
Tuṣita paradise in order to take care of beings in accordance with their
aspirations; in order to ripen the Tuṣita devas whose conduct accords with
mine; in order to manifest a bodhisattva’s merit, wisdom, and display of
miracles to all those who have transcended the realm of desire; in order to
dispel craving for desired pleasures; in order to teach the impermanence of
all that is composite;
 in order to teach their eventual decline to all those
who have been born as devas; in order to discuss,
 together with
bodhisattvas who have one lifetime remaining, the Dharma gateway to great
wisdom; in order to gather together those born there who have been ripened
together with me; and in order to cause the lotuses of the guidance sent forth
by the Tathāgata Śākyamuni to blossom. When the time has come for my
intentions to be fulfilled, I will set out to attain omniscience, and when I have
attained enlightenment, you will see me again, together with the
kalyāṇamitra Mañjuśrī.
2172
2173

54. 416
“Depart, noble one. Go again into the presence of the bodhisattva
Mañjuśrī and ask him, ‘How should bodhisattvas train in bodhisattva
conduct? [F.343.b] How should they practice it? How should they
comprehend the field of completely good conduct? How should they
accomplish it? How should they pray for it? How should they increase it?
How should they follow it? How should they master
 it? How should they
enter it? How should they perfect it?’ Then that kalyāṇamitra will teach you.
2174
54. 417
“Why is that? Because Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has a special prayer for the
accomplishment of that conduct, which a hundred thousand quintillion
bodhisattvas do not have. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has accomplished
countless prayers. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has accomplished countless
special bodhisattva qualities. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta is like a mother for a
hundred thousand quintillion buddhas. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta teaches
instructions to a hundred thousand quintillion bodhisattvas. Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta is dedicated to ripening and guiding all realms of beings.
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has spread the wheel of his name throughout the
world realms of the ten directions. Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta is a person who
has spoken to all the assembled followers of the tathāgatas. Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta is extolled and praised by all the tathāgatas. Mañjuśrī Kumāra-
bhūta sees all phenomena exactly as they are and practices the wisdom of
the profound Dharma. [F.344.a] Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta has the scope of
conduct that has gone far in the ways of all liberations and follows the
completely good bodhisattva conduct.
54. 418
“Noble one, that kalyāṇamitra is the one who has given birth to you into
the family of the tathāgatas; he is the one who has increased your roots of
merit;
 he is the one who has caused you to look for
 bodhisattva
accumulations; he is the one who has revealed
 the kalyāṇamitras to you;
he is the one who has inspired you toward all qualities; he is the one who
caused you to enter the net of great prayers; he is the one who has
established you in the accomplishment of prayers; he is the one who caused
you to hear the secrets of all the bodhisattvas; he is the one who has taught
you all the inconceivabilities of the bodhisattvas; and he is the one who has
practiced together with you in your past lives.
2175
2176
2177
2178
54. 419
“Therefore, noble one, be again at the feet of Mañjuśrī, and do not weary
or be disheartened while receiving all the instructions for the qualities. Why
is that? It is because, Sudhana, you should see that all the kalyāṇamitras that
you have seen, all the gateways to conduct that you have heard, however
many liberations you have engaged in, and whatever specific prayers you
have been immersed in are all because of the power and blessing of Mañjuśrī
Kumāra bhūta.”

54. 420
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, circumambulated him many hundreds of
thousands of times, keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and
again, departed from the bodhisattva Maitreya. [F.344.b]

Chapter 55
MAÑJUŚRĪ
55. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, after passing through a hundred and ten
towns, came to the district called Sumanāmukha, where, while thinking of
and looking for Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, he was aspiring and praying to see
Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta and continually yearning to meet him.
55. 2
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta, from a distance of a hundred and ten
yojanas, extended his hand and placed it upon the head of Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, who was in the town of Sumanāmukha, and said,
“Well done, well done, noble one! Someone who does not have the power of
faith, who has a mind that wearies, who has thoughts of despondency, who
abandons practice, who turns away from diligence, who is pleased by
having a few qualities, who remains clinging to a single root of merit, who is
not skilled in accomplishing the conduct and prayer, who is not in the care of
a kalyāṇamitra, and who does not consider the buddhas is unable to know
the true nature of phenomena in this way, or to know this kind of way and
this kind of range of activity, or to know this kind of place or enter it, or to
believe in it or examine it or understand it or attain it.”
55. 3
Then Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta taught Sudhana by speaking of the Dharma
and, having inspired him, extolled him, and gladdened him, made him the
possessor of countless Dharma gateways, so that he attained the great
illumination of infinite wisdom. He blessed him with a bodhisattva’s
retention, eloquence, samādhi, higher cognitions, and infinite wisdom and
established him in the field of completely good conduct, and he remained in
his own region and departed from the presence of Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son. [F.345.a] [B22]

them; with an immense

the followers of all buddhas; and with an inexhaustible and endless mind
that dwelled in all kalpas and had the conclusive strengths, fearlessnesses,
and unique qualities of all the tathāgatas, Sudhana, in the bodhimaṇḍa,
which had the supreme vajra as its essence, was seated upon a lotus seat
that was a mass of all jewels, gazing at the lion throne that was the seat of
the Tathāgata. [F.346.b]

Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, who was dedicated to that kind of
aspiration and attention, was saturated by previous roots of merit, was
blessed by the tathāgatas, and had the equivalent roots of merit in the past

as the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, and therefore there appeared ten omens
of the appearance of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra.
56. 3
What were those ten? They were that (1) all buddha realms were purified
through having pure adornments at the bodhimaṇḍas of all tathāgatas; (2) all
buddha realms were purified through the elimination of all their unfortunate
states, lower existences, and lower realms; (3) all buddha realms were
purified through becoming pure buddha realms with arrays of lotus
 beds;
(4) all buddha realms were purified through the bodies and minds of all their
beings becoming joyous and happy; (5) all buddha realms were purified
through becoming made of all precious materials; (6) all buddha realms were
purified through all their realms of beings becoming adorned by the signs
and features of a great being; (7) all buddha realms were purified through
being covered by clouds of adornments and decorations; (8) all buddha
realms were purified through all their beings having a nature that was
mutually loving, altruistic, and without malice; (9) all buddha realms were
purified through their bodhimaṇḍas becoming adorned by adornments; and
(10) all buddha realms were purified through all their beings becoming
dedicated to remembering and focusing on the buddhas. [F.347.a] Those
were the ten omens of the appearance of the bodhisattva mahāsattva
Samanta bhadra.
2187
56. 4
There also appeared ten lights that were omens of the appearance of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra.
What were those ten? They were that (1) from each atom of the atoms of all
world realms shone a multitude of nets of light rays from all tathāgatas; (2)
from each atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged a multitude of halos
of buddhas, some of a single color, some of various colors, some with many
hundreds of thousands of colors, spreading throughout the entire realm of
phenomena; (3) from each atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged
clouds of all jewels creating the perception of the images of all tathāgatas
spreading throughout the entire realm of phenomena; (4) from each atom of
the atoms of all world realms emerged wheels, and circles of the light
radiated from all tathāgatas spreading throughout the entire realm of
phenomena; (5) from each atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged a
multitude of clouds of perfume, flowers, garlands, ointments, and incense
that resounded with thunder from all the clouds that proclaimed the ocean of
the phenomena of the qualities of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra,
spreading throughout the entire realm of phenomena; [F.347.b] (6) from each
atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged multitudes of clouds of suns,
moons, and stars, emanating the light of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra,
spreading throughout the entire realm of phenomena; (7) from each atom of
the atoms of all world realms emerged multitudes of clouds of lamps in the

shapes of all bodies,
 shining like the light rays of buddhas and spreading
throughout the entire realm of phenomena; (8) from each atom of the atoms
of all world realms emerged multitudes of clouds of figures made of precious
jewels that represent the bodies of the tathāgatas, spreading throughout all
the world realms in the ten directions; (9) from each atom of the atoms of all
world realms emerged multitudes of clouds of figures made of light rays that
appeared in the forms of the bodies of all the tathāgatas, sending down rain
from the clouds of the blessings and prayers of all the buddhas and
spreading throughout the entire realm of phenomena; and (10) from each
atom of the atoms of all world realms emerged an ocean of clouds of the
images with the appearance of all kinds of forms of the bodies of
bodhisattvas, engaged in liberating
 all beings and accomplishing the
fulfillment of the Dharma aspirations of all beings and spreading throughout
the entire realm of phenomena. Those were the ten great lights that were
omens of the appearance of the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samanta bhadra.
[F.348.a]
2188
2189
56. 5
When Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had seen those ten great lights
as omens, he gained the opportunity to see Samanta bhadra. He had the
support of his own roots of merit. He had the blessing of all the tathāgatas
and had given rise to the illumination of the Dharma of all the buddhas. He
was focused on the conduct of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. He was
blessed by the prayers of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. He aspired to the
range of conduct of all the tathāgatas. He had attained the strength and
power of certainty in the immense field of activity of the bodhisattva. He
thought that seeing the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra would be the same as
attaining omniscience. His faculties were directed to seeing the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra. He had gained the great power of diligence for seeing the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. He applied himself with unflagging diligence
in seeking the sight of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra.
56. 6
With the wheel of his faculties facing in all directions; with the body of a
bodhisattva that has reached the all-seeing
 range of perception; with a
mind fixed on the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra as being present at the feet of
all buddhas without exception; with a focus on all buddhas as the object of
his perception; with an aspiration that never ceased to seek the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra as an object of perception; with the eyes of wisdom that
follow the path of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra having as their essence
the idea of seeing the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra; with an aspiration that
was as vast as space; [F.348.b] with a higher motivation that possessed the
thunderbolt of great compassion; with the prayer
 to follow the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra; with the blessing that lasts till the last of future
kalpas; with the pure power of ascension; by following the same conduct as
2190
2191

that of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra; by dwelling
 in the wisdom that is
established on the level of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra; by residing in the
field of perception of all tathāgatas; and by possessing
 those qualities, he
saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, who had attained equality with all
tathāgatas, who followed the three times equally, who possessed an
inconceivable field of perception, who had an inviolable conduct, who had a
limitless field of perception of wisdom, who was looked upon by all
bodhisattvas, who could not be surpassed by all worlds, who was followed
by all assemblies of followers, and who possessed a superior field of
perception.

and which spread throughout the assemblies of the followers of all
tathāgatas and let fall their rain.

all the buddha realms within the three times [F.350.a] and were as numerous

56. 20

which were as numerous as the atoms in all buddha realms, spreading

56. 29
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was overjoyed, pleased, delighted,
thrilled, and blissful on seeing the scope of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s
miracles, and he contempleted the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s body even
more strongly.
56. 30
In each of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s limbs, in each section of his
limbs, in each part of his body, in each section of the parts of his body, in
each side of his limbs, in each section of the sides of his limbs, in each
form,
 in each section of each form, in each pore, and in each section of
each pore, he saw the images of this billion-world world realm with its mass
of air, its mass of water, its mass of earth, its mass of fire, its oceans, its
continents, its rivers, its mountains of jewels, its Sumerus, its Cakravālas, its
villages, towns, districts, regions, realms, and royal capitals, its forests, its
houses, [F.351.b] its populations, its hells, its animal existences, its Yama
realms, its asura realms, its nāga realms, its deva realms, its Brahmā realms,

realms, its ground, its foundations, its shapes, its clouds, its lightning, its
stars, its days and nights, its fortnights, its months, its seasons, its years, its
intermediate kalpas, and its kalpas.
2194
56. 31
Just as he saw this world realm, he saw the images of all the world realms
in the eastern direction. Just as he saw those in the eastern direction, he also
saw the world realms in the southern direction, in the western direction, in
the northern direction, in the northeastern direction, in the southeastern
direction, in the southwestern direction, in the northwestern direction, and
in the downward and upward directions, together with their appearances of
buddhas and their assemblies of bodhisattva followers.
56. 32
He also saw all the past successions of worlds in this Sahā world realm in
each of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s physical signs of a great being,
[F.352.a] together with their appearances of buddhas, all their assemblies of
bodhisattva followers, all their beings, all their houses, all their days and
nights, and all their kalpas. In the same way, he saw the entire vast extent of
its future buddha realms.
56. 33
Just as he saw the past and future of this world realm, in that way he saw
the succession of all world realms.
56. 34
In the same way, he saw the past and future successive world realms of all
world realms in the ten directions in the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s body,
and in each of his physical signs of a great being and in each pore, all
distinctly and not mixed with one another.
56. 35
In the same way that he saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra manifesting
this play of being seated on a great precious lotus on the center of a lion
throne in front of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Vairocana, in the same way he


---

saw him manifesting this same play in the eastern direction in the world
realm Padmaśrī of the Bhagavat, the Tathāgata Bhadra śrī.
56. 36
In the same way as in the eastern direction, he saw the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra manifesting this play of being seated on a great precious
lotus on the center of a lion throne in front of all the tathāgatas of all the
world realms in the principal and intermediate directions. [F.352.b]
56. 37
In the same way that he saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra manifesting
this display of being seated on a great precious lotus on the center of a lion
throne in front of all the tathāgatas in all the world realms in the ten
directions, he saw, in the atoms of all the buddha realms in the ten
directions, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra manifesting this display of being
seated on a great precious lotus upon the center of a lion throne in front of
all the tathāgatas within an assembly of followers of the Buddha, as vast as
the realm of phenomena, in each atom.
56. 38
He saw in each of those bodies the manifestation of reflections of all
objects of perception in the three times.
56. 39
He saw the manifestation of the perceptions as reflections of all realms, all
beings, all appearances of buddhas, and all the assemblies of bodhisattva
followers.
56. 40
He heard the sounds of all beings, the voices of all buddhas, the Dharma
wheels of all tathāgatas, and all the miraculous manifestations of the
teaching of instructions.
56. 41
Having seen and heard in that way the play
 of the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra’s liberation, he attained the ten practices of the perfection of
knowledge.
2195
56. 42
What are those ten? [F.353.a] (1) He attained the practice of the perfection
of knowledge of filling all buddha realms with his body in each instant of
mind; (2) he attained the practice of the perfection of knowledge of going
into the presence of all tathāgatas without differentiation; (3) he attained the
practice of the perfection of knowledge of serving and making offerings to
all tathāgatas; (4) he attained the practice of the perfection of knowledge of
the attainment of acquiring all the Dharmas of the buddhas from all
tathāgatas and from each tathāgata; (5) he attained the practice of the
perfection of knowledge of the definitive understanding of the Dharma
wheels of all tathāgatas; (6) he attained the practice of the perfection of
knowledge of the inconceivable miracles of the buddhas; (7) he attained the
practice of the perfection of knowledge of an unceasing discernment of all
Dharmas,
 which is steadfast until the last of future kalpas, through the
teaching of a single word of the Dharma; (8) he attained the practice of the
perfection of knowledge that directly perceives the entire ocean
 of the
Dharma; (9) he attained the practice of the perfection of knowledge that

manifests within the perceptions of all beings; and (10) he attained the
practice of the perfection of knowledge that directly perceives the conduct of
the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra in each instant of mind. [F.353.b]
56. 43
The bodhisattva Samanta bhadra extended his right hand and placed it
upon the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, who possessed such a
practice of the perfection of knowledge.
56. 44
The instant that the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra placed his right hand
upon the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, he entered as many
samādhi gateways as there are atoms in all buddha realms. In each samādhi
he realized the sight of an ocean of world realms, as numerous as the atoms
in a buddha realm, which he had never seen before. He gathered as many
accumulations of omniscience as there are atoms in a buddha realm. There
came as many accumulations of the Dharmas of omniscience as there are
atoms in a buddha realm. He arose to as many great establishments in
omniscience as there are atoms in a buddha realm. He comprehended an
ocean of prayers as numerous as the atoms in a buddha realm. He set out
along paths that have arisen from omniscience, which were as numerous as
the atoms in a buddha realm. He entered into as many bodhisattva conducts
as there are atoms in a buddha realm. He increased as many powers of
omniscience as there are atoms in a buddha realm. He illuminated with as
many illuminations from the knowledge of all buddhas as there are atoms in
a buddha realm. [F.354.a]
56. 45
Just as the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, at the feet of the Bhagavat, the
Tathāgata Vairocana in this Sahā world realm, extended his right hand and
placed it upon the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, in the same
way, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra at the feet of the tathāgatas in all world
realms extended his right hand and placed it upon the head of Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son. In the same way, the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra at
the feet of all the tathāgatas within the atoms of all world realms in all the
principal and intermediate directions extended his right hand and placed it
upon the head of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son.
56. 46
Just as Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, entered many Dharma
gateways when touched by the hand of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra at
the feet of the Bhagavat Vairocana, in the same way Sudhana, the head
merchant’s son, entered in many ways many Dharma gateways when
touched by the clouds of hands emanated from all the bodies of Samanta-
bhadra.
56. 47
Then the bodhisattva mahāsattva Samanta bhadra said to Sudhana, the
head merchant’s son, “Noble one, you have seen my miraculous
manifestations.”


---

Sudhana said, “Ārya, I have seen them. The inconceivable liberations that
I have seen can only be known by the knowledge of a tathāgata.” [F.354.b]
56. 48
Samanta bhadra said, “Noble one, I long for the omniscient mind and have
practiced for as many kalpas as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of
buddha realms.
56. 49
“In each of those great kalpas, I purified the aspiration for enlightenment,
and 
I 
served 
as 
many 
tathāgatas 
as 
there 
are 
atoms 
in 
an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
56. 50
“In each of those great kalpas, I accumulated the merit for omniscience
and engaged in all the great giving of gifts and offerings. I held bestowals of
gifts and offerings that were proclaimed throughout the world and were
bestowed upon all beings.
56. 51
“In each of those great kalpas, aspiring to the Dharmas of omniscience, I
gave gifts, great gifts, and extreme gifts that were as numerous as the atoms
in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
56. 52
“In each of those great kalpas, without concern for body and life, and
cherishing the Dharma of the buddhas, I gave away bodies as numerous as
the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms. I gave away great
kingdoms. I gave away villages, towns, regions, lands, realms, and royal
capitals. I gave away gatherings of entourages that were beautiful and
pleasing and that I could not part with. I gave away sons, daughters, and
wives. I gave away my body and flesh. I gave the blood from my body to
those who asked for it. I gave away my bones and marrow. [F.355.a] I gave
away my legs and arms. I gave away the greater and smaller parts of my
body. I gave away my nose and ears. I gave away my eyes. I gave away the
organ of my tongue from my mouth.
56. 53
“In each of those great kalpas, aspiring for the head of omniscience that is
above and higher than all worlds, I gave away my own head as many times
as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
56. 54
“As it was in each of those great kalpas, it was the same in each of an
ocean of kalpas as numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of
buddha realms, in which through becoming a supreme lord I served,
honored, and venerated tathāgatas as numerous as the atoms in an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms, making offerings to them and giving
them clothing, food, beds, medicines when ill, and necessary utensils. I
entered homelessness in the teachings of those tathāgatas, following all
their instructions, and held their teachings.
56. 55
“Noble one, throughout the ocean of that many kalpas, I developed an
aspiration solely for the teaching of the tathāgatas and do not remember ever
developing an inappropriate aspiration. Throughout the ocean of that many
kalpas, I developed solely that aspiration, and I do not remember developing


---

an aspiration through anger, an aspiration through fixation on the self, an
aspiration from protecting and grasping a self, [F.355.b] an aspiration that
made a distinction between self and others, or an aspiration that was not
connected with the path to enlightenment, nor do I remember developing an
aspiration that became wearied or disheartened or confused by obscurations
through remaining in saṃsāra. Instead, I developed the aspiration for
gathering the accumulations for omniscience, an aspiration that had an
invincible knowledge and unconquerable essence.
56. 56
“Noble one, it is like this: an ocean of kalpas would pass if I were to teach
my past perfect practices, my engagement in purifying buddha realms, my
engagement in protecting, ripening, and purifying beings with my
attainment of great compassion, my engagement in making offerings to and
serving buddhas, my engagement in serving gurus in order to seek the good
Dharma, my engagement in giving away my body in order to obtain the
good Dharma, and my engagement in giving up my life in order to protect
the good Dharma.
56. 57
“Noble one, there is not one word or letter from all that ocean of the
Dharma for which I did not give up the kingdom of a cakravartin or all my
possessions through being dedicated to saving all beings, dedicated to
attaining definitive understanding of the continuum of my mind, dedicated
to others hearing the Dharma, dedicated to the elucidation of the light of
worldly knowledge, dedicated to the elucidation of all world-transcending
knowledge, [F.356.a] dedicated to giving rise to happiness in saṃsāra for all
beings, and dedicated to praising the qualities of all the tathāgatas. In that
way, an ocean of kalpas as numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya
of buddha realms would pass by if I were to teach my perfect practices in the
past.
56. 58
“Noble one, in that way, I attained the pure Dharma body that is
undifferentiated by the three times through the strength of such
accumulations, through the strength of the accumulation of the causal roots
of merit, through the strength of a vast aspiration, through the strength of
practicing the qualities, through the strength of correctly comprehending all
Dharmas, through the strength of the eyes of wisdom, through the strength
of the blessing of the tathāgatas, through the strength of great prayers,
through the strength of great compassion, through the strength of perfectly
purified higher cognitions, and through the strength of being taken into the
care of the kalyāṇamitras. I also purified the unsurpassable form body that
transcends all worlds, that is perceived by all beings according to their
aspirations, that is spread throughout all buddha realms, that is present
everywhere, that manifests all miracles in every place, and that is attractive
to all beings.
 [F.356.b]
2198

56. 59
“Noble one, regard this perfect body I have attained, which has been
accomplished through an endless ocean of kalpas and which is rare to
appear and rare to see in many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of
kalpas.
56. 60
“Noble one, those beings who have not developed roots of merit cannot
hear me, let alone see me.
56. 61
“Noble one, those beings who just hear my name become irreversible in
their progress toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Those who just
see me, touch me, accompany me, follow me, see me in a dream, or hear my
name in a dream become irreversible in their progress toward the highest,
complete enlightenment.
56. 62
“Some, through thinking of me, become ripened in one day, some in one
week, some in a fortnight, some in a month, some in a year, some in a
hundred years, some in a kalpa, some in a hundred kalpas, and some in as
many kalpas as there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms.
Some become ripened after as many lifetimes as there are atoms in an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms. Some become ripened through
seeing my light, some through seeing the light rays I radiate, [F.357.a] some
through the realm shaking, some through the manifestation of my form
body, and some through rejoicing in it.
56. 63
“Noble one, in that way, through as many methods as there are atoms in a
buddha realm, beings become irreversible in their progress toward the
highest, complete enlightenment.
56. 64
“Noble one, the beings who hear
 of my pure buddha realm will be
reborn in pure buddha realms. Those who see my pure body will be reborn
with a body like mine. Therefore, noble one, look at my body.”
2199
56. 65
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, contemplated the body of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra and saw an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of oceans of
buddha realms in each pore. He saw in each of those oceans of realms
tathāgatas encircled by oceans of assemblies of bodhisattvas. He saw all
those oceans of realms as having various grounds, various shapes, various
arrays, and various Cakravāla mountain ranges, covered by various clouds
and various skies, and possessing various appearances of buddhas and the
sound of various Dharma wheels.
56. 66
What he saw in each pore he saw in all pores without exception, in all the
physical signs and features of a great being, and in all the greater and
smaller parts of the body. He saw clouds of emanations of bodies of
buddhas, as numerous as the atoms in all buddha realms, appearing in each
of the oceans of realms, pervading all the world realms in the ten directions,
[F.357.b] and ripening beings for the highest, complete enlightenment.


---

56. 67
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, having been taught the instructions
and teachings of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, entered all the world
realms that were within the body of the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra and
ripened beings.
56. 68
The roots of merit accumulated by Sudhana, the head merchant’s son,
through the light of knowledge by coming before, seeing, and honoring as
many kalyāṇamitras as there are atoms in a buddha realm, were not a
hundredth of the roots of merit accumulated by seeing the bodhisattva
Samanta bhadra; they were not even a thousandth, were not even a trillionth,
and could not even be an enumeration, a fraction, a number, an analogy, or a
basis
 for it.
2200
56. 69
However many successions of oceans of buddha realms Sudhana
apprehended from first developing the aspiration for enlightenment until he
saw the bodhisattva Samanta bhadra, he apprehended in each instant of
mind even more successions of oceans of buddha realms, as many
 as
there are atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms, in each of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s pores. Just as it was in each of his pores, so it
was in all his pores without exception, and even if in each instant of mind
Sudhana were to arrive at world realms as numerous as the atoms in an
anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha realms
 and continue spreading through
world realms until the last of future kalpas, he would still not reach the end
of those successions of oceans of buddha realms. [F.358.a] He would not
reach the end of the forms
 of the oceans of realms, the particulars of the
oceans of realms, the groupings of the oceans of realms, the origination of
the oceans of realms, the destruction of the oceans of realms, the categories
of the oceans of realms, the succession of the oceans of the appearances of
buddhas, the bodies of the oceans of the appearances of buddhas, the
particulars of the oceans of the appearances of buddhas, the groupings of
the oceans of the appearances of buddhas, the originations of the oceans of
the appearances of buddhas, the destruction of the oceans of the
appearances of buddhas, the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the successions of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the particulars of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the groupings of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the origination of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the destruction of the oceans of the bodhisattva assemblies of
followers, the entries into the realms of beings, the entries in each instant
into the knowledge of the faculties of beings, the realizations of the
knowledge of the faculties of beings, the ripening and guiding of beings, or
the practices of the profound bodhisattva miracles and would not reach the
end of the ocean of the ascending of bodhisattva bhūmis.

56. 70
He was active in some realms for a kalpa. He was active in some realms for
as many kalpas as there are atoms
 in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of realms,
and he did not depart from those realms. [F.358.b] In each instant of mind, he
ripened beings for the highest, complete enlightenment in a vast extent of an
ocean of realms with no end or middle, until in that way he eventually
attained equality with the ocean of the prayers and the conduct of the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra. He attained equality with all the tathāgatas,
equality with their pervasion of all realms by their bodies, equality with their
fulfillment of conduct, equality with their manifesting the miraculous
manifestation of the attainment of complete buddhahood, equality with their
turning the wheel of the Dharma, equality with their pure discernment,
equality with the utterances of their voices, equality with the engagement in
the oceans of all the aspects of their voices, equality with their great love and
great compassion, and equality with the miraculous manifestation of the
inconceivable liberations of the bodhisattvas.
2204
56. 71
The bodhisattva mahāsattva Samanta bhadra then composed these verses
in order to further elucidate kalpas, the vast extent of kalpas, and world
realms as numerous as the atoms in an anabhilāpyānabhilāpya of buddha
realms:
56. 72
However many
 lions among men there are
2205
In the three times, in the worlds in the ten directions,
I pay homage to them all without exception,
With purity of body, speech, and mind. {1} [F.359.a]
56. 73
Thinking that all the jinas are before me,
With the power of the prayer of good conduct,
I bow down toward all the jinas
With as many bodies as there are atoms in the realms.
 {2}
2206
56. 74
There are as many buddhas as atoms within a single atom,
Seated in the midst of bodhisattvas.2207
I focus on the entire realm of phenomena,
Without exception, being filled by jinas in that way. {3}
56. 75
I recite a praise of all the sugatas,
Enumerating the qualities of all the jinas,
With unending oceans of eulogies
And the sound of oceans of every quality of voice. {4}
56. 76
I make an offering to those jinas
Of perfect flowers, perfect garlands,
Perfect music, ointments, and parasols,


---

Perfect lights, and perfect incenses. {5}
56. 77
I make offerings to those jinas
Of perfect clothing and perfect perfumes,
Pouches of scented powders equal to Mount Meru,
And all perfect, sublime displays. {6}
56. 78
Offerings that are unsurpassable and exalted
I am resolved to offer to all the jinas.
I praise and make offerings to all the jinas
Through the power of devotion
 to good conduct. {7}
2208
56. 79
Whatever bad actions I have done
Under the power of desire, anger, and ignorance,
With my body, speech, and mind,
I make a confession of them all. {8}
56. 80
I am rejoicing in the entirety of merit
In the ten directions that is created by beings,
By practicing and accomplished pratyeka buddhas,2209
By the bodhisattvas, and by all the jinas.
 {9}
2210
56. 81
I make the request to all the lords,
The lamps of the worlds in the ten directions,
Who have attained without impediment the enlightenment of buddhahood,
That they turn the unsurpassable wheel. {10}
56. 82
With palms placed together, I supplicate
Those who wish to manifest passing into nirvāṇa
That they remain for as many kalpas as there are atoms in the realms,
For the benefit and happiness of all beings. {11} [F.359.b]
56. 83
Whatever little virtue
 I have accumulated
2211
Through homage, offering, confession,
Rejoicing, supplication, and entreating,
I dedicate it all to enlightenment. {12}
56. 84
May the buddhas of the past and those who are present
In the worlds of the ten directions be offered to.
May those in the future swiftly fulfill
Their aspirations for the enlightenment of buddhahood. {13}
56. 85
May the realms that are in the ten directions
Become purified and sublime.2212
May they become filled with jinas, who have come


---

To the Bodhi tree, the lord of trees, and with bodhisattvas. {14}
56. 86
However many beings there are in the ten directions,
May they all be always happy and healthy.
May all beings be successful in their Dharma goals,
And may their wishes be fulfilled. {15}
56. 87
May I practice the conduct of enlightenment
And remember my lives in all existences.
May I always practice mendicancy
In all my lifetimes of deaths and rebirths. {16}
56. 88
Following the teaching of all the jinas
And perfecting my good conduct,
May I always practice stainless, pure,
Correct conduct that is flawless and unblemished. {17}
56. 89
May I teach the Dharma in all languages,
Whatever the languages of beings:
Through the languages of devas, the languages of nāgas,
The languages of yakṣas, kumbhāṇḍas, and humans. {18}
56. 90
May one who is gentle
 and dedicated to the perfections
2213
Never forget the aspiration to enlightenment.
May the obscurations of bad karma
Be purified without any remainder. {19}
56. 91
May my conduct, even in the worldly existences,
Be free of karma, kleśas, and the actions
 of Māra,
2214
Just as the lotus is unstained by water
And the sun and moon are unobstructed in the sky. {20} [F.360.a]
56. 92
May I end all the sufferings of lower existences
And establish all beings in happiness,
Practicing a conduct that brings benefit to all beings
Throughout the directions and the extent
 of realms. {21}
2215
56. 93
May I practice this conduct in all future kalpas,
Conforming with the conduct of beings,
Perfecting the conduct of enlightenment,
And teaching good conduct.
 {22}
2216
56. 94
May I always be in the company of those
Whose conduct is in harmony with my conduct.
May my body, my speech, and also my mind


---

Practice the same conduct and have the same prayer.
 {23}
2217
56. 95
May I always associate
With friends who wish to benefit me
And teach me the correct conduct,
And may I never displease them. {24}
56. 96
May I always see before me the jinas,
The lords who are encircled by bodhisattvas,
And may I make vast
 offerings to them,
2218
Without wearying, throughout all future kalpas. {28}
56. 97
Keeping the good Dharma of the jinas,
Expounding
 the conduct of enlightenment,
2219
And purifying the good conduct,
May I practice that conduct in all future kalpas. {26}
56. 98
While circling through all existences,
May I obtain inexhaustible merit and knowledge.
May I be
 an inexhaustible treasure of wisdom,
2220
Methods, samādhis, liberations, and all good qualities. {27}
56. 99
There are realms as numerous as atoms in each atom,
And while practicing the conduct of enlightenment,
May I see in those realms countless buddhas
Who are seated in the midst of bodhisattvas. {28}
56. 100
May I engage in practicing conduct for an ocean of kalpas
Within every hair’s breadth in every direction,
Without exception, in which there are an ocean
Of buddhas of the three times, and an ocean of realms. {29} [F.360.b]
56. 101
May I always comprehend
 the speech of the buddhas,
2221
Which, through having an ocean of languages in a single syllable,
Has the purity of the aspects of the speech of all the jinas
And words that accord with the aspirations of all beings.
 {30}
2222
56. 102
May I comprehend, through the power of the mind,
The unceasing sounds of the voices
Of the jinas in
 the three times,
2223
Who are turning the wheel in various ways.
 {31}
2224
56. 103
May I enter all the future kalpas,
Entering them in a single instant,
And in a fraction of an instant practice


---

The conduct throughout the kalpas of the three times. {32}
56. 104
May I in a single instant see
The lions among humans in
 the three times.
2225
Through the power of the liberation of being an illusion,
May I always enter into their conduct. {33}
56. 105
May the displays of realms in the three times
Be accomplished within a single atom.
May I perceive such displays of the realms of the jinas
That are in every direction without exception. {34}
56. 106
May I go into the presence of all those lords,
Those future lamps of the world, who will successively
Attain enlightenment, turn the wheel,
And demonstrate the final peace of entering nirvāṇa. {35}
56. 107
Through the power of miracles that has complete speed,
Through the power of yānas
 that possesses every gateway,
2226
Through the power of conduct that has the complete qualities,
Through the power of love that is universal, {36}
56. 108
Through the power of merit that has complete goodness,
Through the power of knowledge that is without impediment,
Through the power of wisdom, methods, and samādhi,
May I accomplish the power of enlightenment. {37}
56. 109
May I purify the power of karma,
Destroy the power of the kleśas,
Render powerless the power of the māras,
And make complete all the powers of good conduct. {38}
56. 110
May I purify an ocean of realms, [F.361.a]
Liberate an ocean of beings,
See an ocean of the Dharma,
And realize
 an ocean of knowledge. {39}
2227
56. 111
May I purify an ocean of conduct,
Fulfill an ocean of prayers,
Make offerings to an ocean of buddhas,
And have tireless conduct for an ocean of kalpas. {40}
56. 112
May I, through good conduct, realize enlightenment
And fulfill, without exception,
All the specific prayers of enlightened conduct


---

That are made by the jinas in the three times. {41}
56. 113
I dedicate all this virtue
So that I may have the same conduct as that wise one,
The eldest son of all the jinas,
Whose name is Samanta bhadra.
 {42}
2228
56. 114
Just as the good wise one made a dedication
For a pure body, speech, and mind,
A pure conduct, and a pure realm,
May it be the same for me. {43}
56. 115
May I practice the conduct of Mañjuśrī’s prayer
For good conduct, for complete goodness,
Without weariness throughout the kalpas to come.
May I complete all those activities without exception. {44}
56. 116
May there be no limit to that conduct;
May there be no limit to those good qualities,
And having maintained a conduct that has no limit,
May I give rise to all those miraculous powers. {45}
56. 117
If there were an end to space,
There would be an end to all beings.
Only when their karma and kleśas end
Will my prayers also come to an end. {46}
56. 118
If someone offered to the jinas the endless realms
In the ten directions adorned with jewels
And the most excellent pleasures of devas and humans
For kalpas as numerous as the atoms in a realm, {47}
56. 119
Someone who has faith just once
On hearing this king of dedications
And aspires to attain perfect enlightenment
Will have a higher, superior merit. {48} [F.361.b]
56. 120
Whoever recites this prayer for good conduct
Will be free from all
 lower existences,
2229
Will be free from bad companions,
And will quickly see Amitābha. {49}
56. 121
They will have in this life the good fortune
Of obtaining success, a happy life,
And will soon become


---

The same as Samanta bhadra. {50}
56. 122
If someone through the power of ignorance
Has the bad karma of the five actions with immediate results,
They will be purified of it, without any remainder
Through reciting this prayer for good conduct. {51}
56. 123
They will have the wisdom, form,
Features, family, and color,
Be invincible to hosts of māras and tīrthikas,
And be offered to by the entire three realms. {52}
56. 124
They will soon go to the Bodhi tree, the lord of trees,
And having reached there be seated for the benefit of beings,
Become enlightened in buddhahood, turn the wheel of the Dharma,
And overpower Māra and his entire army. {53}
56. 125
The Buddha knows the result that ripens
For the one who possesses, recites,
Or teaches this prayer for good conduct.
Do not doubt the supreme enlightenment! {57}
56. 126
Just as the hero Mañjuśrī knows,
In that way
 so does Samanta bhadra.
2230
2231
In practicing in the same way as they do,
I am dedicating all this merit. {55}
56. 127
With the prayer that is praised as supreme
By all the jinas in the three times,
I am dedicating all this merit
For the supreme good conduct. {56}
56. 128
When the time has come for me to die,
May I dispel all obscurations,
See Amitābha before me,
And go to the Sukhāvatī realm. {57}

When I have gone there, may these prayers [F.362.a]
All become completely manifest.
May I fulfill them all without exception
And benefit beings for as long as there are worlds. {58}

May I be born from a beautiful, perfect lotus
In that pleasant, beautiful circle of the jinas,
And there obtain my prophecy

Directly from the Jina Amitābha. {59}

Having obtained there the prophecy,
May I through the power of mind
Bring many benefits to beings in the ten directions
Through many billions of emanations. {60}

May what little merit I have accumulated
Through reciting the good conduct prayer
Cause the virtuous prayers of beings
All to be fulfilled in an instant. {61}

Through the sublime, endless merit attained
By my dedicating the good conduct,
May the beings drowning in a river of suffering
Depart to the supreme residence of Amitābha. {62}

A Multitude of Buddhas is the marvelous essence of the final, ultimate,
definitive wheel from among the three wheels of the Sugata’s teaching. It
has many other titles, such as The Mahāvaipulya Basket, The Earring, The Lotus
Adornment, and so on.
c. 3
It has seven sections:
 A Multitude of Tathāgatas,
 The Vajra Banner
Dedication,
 The Teaching of the Ten Bhūmis,
 The Teaching of Completely Good
Conduct,
 [F.362.b] The Teaching of the Birth and Appearance of the Tathāgatas,
The Transcendence of the World,
 and Stem Array.

According to Butön Rinpoché and others, it contains thirty-nine thousand
and thirty verses, a hundred and thirty fascicles, and an additional thirty
verses. In the Tshalpa Kangyur edition there are a hundred and fifteen
fascicles, the Denkarma edition has a hundred and twenty-seven
fascicles,
 and present-day editions have various numbers of fascicles.

This sūtra was first received from Ārya Nāgārjuna by Paṇḍita
Buddhabhadra and Paṇḍita Śikṣānanda (652–710), and they both translated
it into Chinese. It is taught that Surendrabodhi and Vairocana rakṣita became
principal editors for a Chinese translation.
c. 6
As for the lineage of the text, there is the lineage from China: The perfect
Buddha, Ārya Mañjuśrī, Lord Nāgārjuna, the two paṇḍitas mentioned above,
and Heshang Tushun. Then the lineage continued through others until Üpa


---

Sangyé Bum received it from Heshang Gying-ju. Then that lineage was
passed on through Lotsawa Chokden and has continued up to the present
time.
c. 7
The lineage from India is as follows:
It was passed from Nāgārjuna to Āryadeva, and then Mañjuśrīkīrti, and so
on, until Bari Lotsawa received it from Vajrāsana. It is taught that the lineage
then continued through Chim Tsöndrü Sengé, the great Sakya Lord,
 and
so on.

However, I have not seen any other text or history of a translation made
by any other lotsawa or paṇḍita other than those listed in the colophon to
this translation into Tibetan.
c. 9
The king of Jangsa Tham
 had a complete Kangyur made that was
based on the Tshalpa Kangyur. At the present time this is known as the
Lithang Tshalpa Kangyur (1609–14). I considered this to be a reliable source
and so have made it the basis for this edition. However, it has many
omissions, accretions, and misspellings, and therefore I have at this time
corrected it by seeking out many older editions.
2244
c. 10
There are variant Indian texts and conflicting translations, and I have not
been able to ascertain from them a definitive single meaning or correct
words. Nevertheless, this text is nothing but a valid edition.
c. 11
There are varying translations of terms that have been left unrevised, as
there is no contradiction in meaning. For example, it has rgyan instead of bkod
pa;
 ’byam klas instead of rab ’byams;
 so so yang dag par rig pa instead of tha
dad pa yang dag par shes pa;
 thugs for dgongs pa;
 [F.363.a] nyin mtshan dang
zla ba yar kham mar kham dang instead of nyin mtshan dang yud du yan man
dang;
 and tha snyad instead of rnam par dpyod pa.

c. 12
Sanskrit words have many cases and tenses, so that although the Tibetan
lotsawas and paṇḍitas, who had the eyes of the Dharma, translated their
meaning, their tenses, cases, and so on are difficult to discern. Those are the
majority of the examples of uncertainty, and there are also a few other kinds,
but they are nevertheless in accord with Tibetan grammar.
c. 13
In most texts there are many archaic words, so that the meaning of the
translation is not clear, but there is a consistency when those words are all in
archaic Tibetan. However, there appears to have occurred in later times a
strong adulteration of the text so that there is a mixture of archaic and
modern forms. There are also unreliable placements of the shad mark that
differentiates clauses, but all these have been left as they are because these
faults are few and minor. Therefore, this revision has been diligently edited
without becoming analogous to knocking down the ancient megaliths of the
southern regions.

 in the
presence of Tenpa Tsering (1678–1738), the divine Dharma king who rules in

good actions, and who is a bodhisattva as a ruler of humans and the source

See colophon, c. 3.
Pekar Zangpo, mdo sde spy’i rnam bzhag (2006), 18.
This depiction of Śākyamuni as a Vairocana emanation has its precedent in a
sūtra that was never translated into Tibetan but exists in Chinese translation:
the Brahma jāla sūtra. This sūtra introduces the Buddha Vairocana as the
primordial buddha who is the source of ten billion Śākyamunis who exist
simultaneously in ten billion different worlds. This sūtra should not be
confused with the Brahma jāla sūtra that exists both in the Pali canon and in the
Tibetan Kangyur (Toh 352).
See Peter Alan Roberts, trans., The Ten Bhūmis
(https://read.84000.co/translation/toh44-31.html), Toh 44-31.
There is evidence for Mahāyāna sūtras originating in northern India. In his
Genealogies of Mahāyāna Buddhism, Joseph Walser argues that the “core
portion” of The Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines (Toh 12, Aṣṭa -
sāhasrikā prajñā pāramitā) was most probably written in the second half of the
first century in Mathura, which is located in present-day Uttar Pradesh. He
also offers the tentative conclusion that it was written by “a Sarvāstivādin
monk residing at Buddhadeva’s Guhavihāra outside of Maṭ.” See Walser
(2018), 242.
Osto notes that Etienne Lamotte, Edward Conze, and Nalinaksha Dutt all
regard the Mahāsāṃghika as the source of the Mahāyāna tradition. See Osto
(2008), 157, n. 5. Paul Williams argues that at least some Mahāyāna sūtras
emerged from the Mahāsāṃghika: “There can be no doubt that at least some
early Mahāyāna sūtras originated in Mahāsāṃghika circles. In the
lokottaravāda supramundane teachings we are getting very close to a teaching
well-known in Mahāyāna that the Buddha’s death was also a mere

appearance; in reality he remains out of his compassion, helping suffering
humanity, and thence the suggestion that for those who are capable of it the
highest religious goal should be not to become an Arhat but to take the
Bodhisattva vows, embarking themselves on the long path to a supreme and
totally superior Buddhahood.” See Williams (2009), 21. This view has been
contested by a number of scholars, however, including Paul Harrison, who
maintains in his “Searching for the Origins of the Mahāyāna: What Are We
Looking For?” that it is impossible to draw a clear connection between the
Mahāyāna and a single sect, maintaining instead that the Mahāyāna was a
loose set of related movements that cut across Buddhist India. For a fine
summary of scholarship concerning the origins of the Mahāyāna, see Osto

could be translated, “the great Dharma discourse called the Gaṇḍa vyūha from
within the Bodhisattva piṭaka called the vast Buddhāvataṃsaka Sūtra,” which
suggests that the Buddhāvataṃsaka is a type of text known as a Bodhisattva -
piṭaka. Urga (vol. 38, folio 362.a) has sangs rgyas phal po che zhes bya ba/ shin tu
rgyas pa chen po’i mdo las/ byang chub sems dpa’i sde snod cing / sdong pos rgyan pa
zhes bya ba, which could be translated as “the Bodhisattva piṭaka and Gaṇḍa -
vyūha from the Mahāvaipulya sūtra called the Buddhāvatamska,” although cing
grammatically should follow a verb, not a noun, and it could well be an error
for kyi nang when that is pronounced “chi nang.” This, like the
aforementioned colophon from Dunhuang, suggests that both Bodhisattva -
piṭaka and Gaṇḍa vyūha are titles for one and the same work. By contrast, the
Degé (vol. 38, folio 362.a) and Kangxi (vol. 60, folio 263.a) read shin tu rgyas pa
chen po’i mdo/ sangs rgyas phal po che zhes bya ba las/ byang chub sems dpa’i sde snod
kyi nang / sdong pos brgyan pa zhes bya ba chos kyi rnam grangs chen po las. This
could be rendered, “From the Mahāvaipulya sūtra called the
Buddhāvataṃsaka, from within the Bodhisattva piṭaka, the great Dharma
discourse called the Gaṇḍa vyūha,” meaning that the Gaṇḍa vyūha is from the
Bodhisattva piṭaka, a collection of bodhisattva teachings, and has been
included in the Buddhāvataṃsaka. In other words, the Gaṇḍa vyūha is contained
in the Bodhisattva piṭaka that is contained in the Buddhāvataṃsaka —a statement
that would not seem to make much sense.

see Introduction i. 65. In Śikṣānanda’s eighty-fascicle Chinese translation
(hereafter, “the Chinese”), this is presented as the thirty-ninth sūtra in
twenty-one fascicles, from 60 to 80. Each fascicle bears the title ⼊法界品 (ru fa

Avalokitanetra, which is absent in both the Chinese and the Tibetan, most
likely the result of a scribal omission due to the similarity of the names.
In the Sanskrit and the Chinese this is followed by “the bodhisattva
Samanta netra,” which is not present in the Tibetan.
The Sanskrit has “bodhisattva mahāsattva.” The Chinese ends all names
with “bodhisattva.”
The Sanskrit has “bodhisattva mahāsattva.”
The Sanskrit has “bodhisattva mahāsattva.”

The Chinese translation uses the term 成就 (cheng jiu), which means
“accomplished.” Sanskrit: abhiniryāta.
The Sanskrit samantabhadra bodhi sattva caryā praṇidhāna could also be
interpreted, as is similarly found in Osto, as “the prayer for the bodhisattva
conduct of Samanta bhadra,” though this would more regularly be written as
bodhi sattva samantabhadra caryā praṇidhāna.
According to the Sanskrit. The translation of the word vijñaptiṣu, which
would have been translated as rnam par rig byed, appears to have been
inadvertently omitted in the Tibetan, either from the Sanskrit manuscript it
was translated from or at an early stage in the copying of the text. The
Chinese translation has ⾄處無限 (zhi chu wu xian, “who had been to
countless places”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
inadvertently omitted “of the buddhas.”
According to the Sanskrit guṇa. The word yon tan (the translation of guṇa) is
absent in the Tibetan, and absent in the Chinese as well.
According to the Sanskrit anigṛhīta. The Tibetan translates as the vague mi
gnas pa, which could be interpreted as “not dwelling” or “unlocated.”
Similarly, the Chinese describes their manifestations as 無所依⽌ (wu suo yi
zhi, “nondwelling”) because they are in accordance with the aspirations of
beings.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan inadvertently omits
“wisdom.”
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have translated tshogs from
a manuscript in which gagaṇa (“space”) was corrupted to gaṇa (“crowd,”
“class,” “group”) so that it meant “the range of activity of the crowd of
tathāgatas.” The Chinese omits the description “that is as extensive as
space.”
According to the Tibetan sgo (“gateway”). The Chinese translation has ⾨
(men, “door”) as well. The available Sanskrit appears to have sukha (“bliss”)
in error for mukha (“door”).

According to the Sanskrit vihāra and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to

According to the Sanskrit kāya and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
inadvertently omitted it.
According to kyis in Degé and most Kangyurs. Lithang and Choné have kyi.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have kyi in error for kyis in
all versions. The Chinese has 隨順 (sui shun, “according to”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has rgyan (“adornment”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has rgyan
(“adornment”). The Chinese translates this as “how he had practiced.”
The Tibetan has interpreted the compound as bsgrub pa dang / rnam par ’phrul
pa, meaning “attainments and miraculous manifestations.”
According to the Sanskrit dakṣina, and yon in Stok Palace, Yongle, Narthang,
and Lhasa. Other Kangyurs have yon tan (“qualities”). The Chinese
translates as 布施功德 (bu shi gong de, “the merit of generosity”).
According to the instrumental particle in most Kangyurs, including Stok
Palace, but absent in Lithang and Choné.
These three qualities (i.e., extensive as space, beyond example, and having
adornments) appear only in the Tibetan. The Sanskrit and the Chinese have
mahā karuṇāśarīra and ⼤悲為⾝ (da bei wei shen), both of which mean “the body
of great compassion,” which is absent in Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has a genitive particle that connects
this description with the following one.
The Tibetan here and elsewhere translates jagat as ’gro ba (“beings”) instead
of its meaning as “world.” The Chinese translates as “the world” to describe
the precious jewels as “the best of the world.”
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has a genitive particle that connects
this description with the following one.
According to the Sanskrit rāja and rgyal po in Stok Palace, Narthang, and
Lhasa. Other Kangyurs have rgyal ba.

of divine bodies”).
According to the Tibetan. In Sanskrit this is divided into two descriptions:
“Adorned by a rain from clouds of every flower, adorned by a profusion of a
treasure of excellent flowers.” The Chinese has 華樹 (hua shu, “flowering
trees” or “flowers and trees”).
According to the Tibetan. “Trees” is absent in the available Sanskrit. The
Chinese has ⾐樹雲 (yi shu yun, “clouds of clothes and trees”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan translates paṭala, here meaning “a
mass or assemblage,” as na bun (“mist”). The Sanskrit śarīra here has the
meaning of “world” or “universe” but was translated into Tibetan by its
more general meaning of “body,” creating a meaningless sentence. The
Chinese reads ⼀切⼤地 (yi qie da di), literally “all great lands,” which can
mean the “world” or “universe,” either singular or plural. It describes the
following clouds of incense as ⼀切如眾⽣形 (yī qiè rú zhòng shēng xíng, “in
forms of all sentient beings”). Cleary has “form of all beings” while Osto has
“body of the entire world.”
According to the Sanskrit jala and the Chinese 網 (wang). The Tibetan appears
to have translated from rāja (“king”). The word “powder” is absent in the
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit bimba. The Tibetan translates as ’bru, which could
be taken to mean “grain.” Not present in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit adhitiṣṭha. The Tibetan translates it as byin gyis brlab
pa (“blessed”). The Chinese presents all these items as part of the
manifestation without adding verbs to each.
In the Sanskrit this is followed by “manifested the circles of followers in all
buddha realms,” which is absent in the Tibetan and the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit and Tibetan later in the sūtra. At this point the
Sanskrit omits tejo, while the Tibetan omits rgyal po (rāja).
According to the Sanskrit. Tibetan has bdug spos (“incense”) instead of rgyal
mtshan (“banners”). The sentence then repeats, so this is apparently an error.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan omits “flowers” and
has a second repetition of the same sentences, so this omission is apparently
an error.

According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan here is particularly corrupt and
descends into gibberish: mdangs ’byung bas thams cad kyi rdul gyi kha dog dang
’dra ba’i (“through shining with light they are like the color of dust/atoms”).
The Chinese does not mention “pores” and describes such jewels as
“brilliant.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have an
inadvertent omission of the last two syllables of its name (rgyal mtshan).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have an
inadvertent omission of “clothing.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have an
inadvertent omission of “clothing.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have an
inadvertent omission of “clothing.”
The Sanskrit has the adjective pāṇḍu (“white”).
According to the Mahāvyutpatti, the Sanskrit śilā should be translated as man
shel (“crystal”), though here it was anomalously translated as khra bo’i rdo
(“multicolored stone”), which may be why the adjective “white” in the
Sanskrit was omitted. The Chinese translates śilā as ⽩⽟ (bai yu, “white
jade”).
Lithang and Choné have sprin (“clouds”) in error for spyan (“eyes”).
Sanskrit: sarva ratna dharma dhātvabhimukha dvāra śikhara mahā maṇi ratna kūṭāgārān,
“kūṭāgāras of every precious material with gateways that looked out upon
the realm of phenomena and pinnacles of great jewels.” The Chinese is the
same as the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has two sentences,
the first including rin po che’i gos ’od ’phro ba (“light rays from precious
clothing”), and the second bdug spos sna tshogs kyis rnam par bdugs pa (“light
rays perfumed by incenses and perfumes of all kinds”). The Chinese
describes this as 香 (xiang, “incenses”) without mentioning clothing.
According to the Tibetan sems can thams cad rab tu ’dzud pa, which could also
mean “entered into all beings.” The Chinese of the Sanskrit sarva sattva -
prasthāna, according to Cleary, means that the sounds are “of the abodes of all
beings.” According to Osto it means the sounds “of all beings.” Prasthāna can
mean “to set out for” or “origin.” The Chinese describes the head adornment

inadvertently omitted part of the name: rnam par snang mdzad kyi [dpal gyi
smon lam gyi] snying po.
The Tibetan uses sgra bsgrags pa throughout this passage, but the Sanskrit has
mostly pramuñcan (“emits”) and also has nigarjan (“roars”) twice.
According to the Tibetan skad and the Chinese 語⾔ (yu yan). The Sanskrit has
“mantras.”
The Sanskrit has nigarjan (“roars”).
In the Sanskrit the sentence ends with an additional description that is
absent from the Tibetan and the Chinese: “…and with their bodhisattva
bodies adorned with networks of kings of jewels that illuminated all realms.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “gifts of clothing.” The Chinese
mentions only recipients of generosity.
According to the BHS abhirocana. The meaning in Classical Sanskrit would be
“delighting.” Osto translates this from the Chinese as “illumination,” and
Cleary translates it as “pleasing.” The Tibetan mngon par mos par byed pa
would literally be “cause to have aspiration.”
According to the Sanskrit vyūha. The Tibetan translates as rgyan, and the
Chinese as 莊嚴 (zhuang yan, “adornments,” “jewelry”).
According to the Sanskrit anāyūha and the Chinese 終無所來 (zhong wu suo lai).

This and the previous quality are combined in the Sanskrit and the Chinese.

According to the BHS vijñapti, translated in Chinese as ⽰現 (shi xian). Tibetan
translates as dmyigs pa (archaic spelling of dmigs pa).
From the Tibetan grub pa. The Sanskrit nirvṛtta could mean happiness, peace,
extinction, or the state of nirvāṇa.
The order of the first and second qualities in this list is reversed in the
Sanskrit.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. “Dream-like” appears to have
been inadvertently omitted from the Tibetan.
Both epithets (i.e. agrayuga bhadrayuga; mchog gi zung, bzang po’i zung) refer to

“eyes of wisdom.”
According to the Sanskrit vṛkaśṛgāla and the Chinese 豺狼 (chai lang). The

treasures.”
According to the Sanskrit śilpasuśikṣita. The Tibetan has (in Yongle, Kangxi,
and Choné) don rtags (“signs or proof of meaning”). Other Kangyurs such as
Degé and Stok Palace have dan in error for don.
According to the syntax of the Sanskrit. The Tibetan syntax is obscure.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit akalperyāpatha means “improper
conduct” or “improper ascetic practices.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. Omitted in the Tibetan.
According to the Tibetan lus, presumably translated from kāya. The present
available Sanskrit has kārya (“activities”), but kāya when this is repeated.
According to the Sanskrit, Chinese, and Yongle, Narthang, and Lhasa
versions of the Tibetan. Degé, Stok Palace, and other Kangyurs have sems can
(“being”) in error for sems (“mind”).
The Tibetan translates inconsistently as shes (“know”).
According to the BHS meaning of varṇa, the Pali vaṇṇa, and the Chinese 相
(xiang). The Tibetan translates according to the most common meaning of the
Sanskrit varṇa as an archaic term for color: kha dog mdog.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit is confusing, as the bodhisattvas are
plural nominative, but there is a third-person singular for the verb “does not
see.” Possibly the bodhisattvas should be in the plural accusative, in which
case the verse could mean “[The world] does not see the great gathering of
bodhisattvas / who have arrived from countless millions of realms to see the
Jina.” The Chinese uses the second-person plural.
According to the Sanskrit compound cittagocara. The Tibetan interprets it as
“mind and range.” The Chinese translates it as 境界 (xin jing jie) rather than
the usual term ⼼境界 (xin jing jie), omitting ⼼ (xin), the word for “mind,”
probably to keep the same number of words in each line of the verses.
According to the Sanskrit aparājitāḥ and the Yongle pham myed and Narthang
pham med. Other Kangyurs have the incorrect pham byed.
The order of this and the subsequent verse are reversed in the Tibetan
translation; this inverse order is preserved here. The Chinese matches the
order of the Sanskrit.

According to the BHS anirvṛta. The Tibetan translates as grub pa med pa
(“without production”). The Chinese has translated the second part of this
verse as 知無變化法, ⽽現變化事 (zhi wu bian hua fa, er xian bian hua shi, “they
know the unchanging instructions on Dharma, but manifest changing
events”).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit can be translated as “the Buddha
does not have a region.”
According to the Tibetan, presumably from deśānugaḥ. The Sanskrit can be
translated as “the Buddha does not go into a direction (diśānugaḥ).” The
Chinese translation of this verse has considerable wordplay, using the
common translation of the Sanskrit diśānugaḥ as 無量 (wu liang), which has
the connotation of being inconceivable, without any quantifiable,
measurable, or ascertainable feature, including direction and realm, contrary
to its antonym 有量 (you liang). The verse in Chinese can be understood as
“the state of enlightenment is neither 無量 nor 有量; the great Muni has gone
beyond both.”
Literally, “does not go beyond.” According to the Sanskrit, the Stok Palace,
and the Degé las. Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné have pas. The Chinese
does not have the negative.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has plural.
According to the Sanskrit instrumental and Yongle, Narthang, and Lhasa yis.
Other Kangyurs have the genitive yi. “Looking through” is implied.
There is a play on words in the Sanskrit, as varṇa has many meanings,
including “color” as well as “class,” “caste,” “nature,” “character,” and
“quality.” This play on words is lost in English and in the Tibetan. The
Chinese interprets the term as 願 (yuan, “aspirations”).
This verse is translated according to the Tibetan. The Chinese is similar to
the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit second-person plural. The Tibetan is ambiguous.
The Chinese has “the various activities of the bodhisattvas” as the subject.
According to the Sanskrit, Stok Palace, and Narthang bu’i.
According to the Sanskrit śodhana, Chinese 清淨 (qing jing), and the Stok
Palace sbyong. Other Kangyurs apparently have has spyod in error for sbyong.

According to the Sanskrit pramocana. The Tibetan has ’grel ba in error for ’grol
ba.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit vinīyante means “guided” or
“trained.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit reads saṃbuddha. The Chinese is the
same as the Sanskrit.
According to the Sanskrit suvicitra. Tibetan has bris (“written,” “drawn”) in
error for bres.
The second half of the verse is in accordance with the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit mahā. Stok Palace, Narthang, and Lhasa have chen,
which matches the Sanskrit and the Chinese ⼤ (da, “great”). Degé and others
have can; Yongle has cen.
According to the Sanskrit. Presumably for lack of room in the Tibetan verse,
“of buddhahood” is omitted. The Chinese has 無上覺 (wu shang jue,
“supreme, unsurpassable enlightenment”).
According to the Tibetan, which has two synonymous adjectives, while the
Sanskrit and the Chinese have one adjective.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has rtag par
apparently in error for brtags par (“examine” as in Stok Palace).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan reads de la sems skye med par bsam,
which appears to mean “He thinks that the mind is birthless.” The Chinese
translation appears to evolve around the word 思 (si), which functions both
as a noun and a verb, meaning “thoughts,” “to think,” “that which/who
thinks,” and so on: 智者應如是, 專思佛菩提; 此思難思議, 思之不可得 (zhi zhe
ying ru shi, zhuan si fo pu ti; ci si nan si yi, si zhi bu ke de, “The wise one should
be like this, dedicating his mind to the enlightenment of buddhahood. This
mind is inconceivable; it is not knowable or obtainable [by contemplation]”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has either misread
baddha (“bound”) as buddha or was translating from a manuscript containing
that error. The result in Tibetan is “Although the buddhas continuously
appear, the world remains fruitless.” The Chinese has 凡夫嬰妄惑，於世常流
轉 (fan fu ying chang liu zhuan, yu shi chang liu zhuan, “Ordinary beings suffer
from illusions and confusions, continuously wandering in the world”).

According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan omits jñāna vikrānta (ye shes kyis rnam
par gnon pa), which was present in the earlier version of the name. Earlier in
the Degé we find non pa rather than gnon pa.
Literally “hundreds of ten millions.”
According to the Sanskrit puṇyatīrtha (literally, “merit worthy”), a term used
for places of pilgrimage etc., translated into Tibetan obscurely as bsod nams
stegs. The Chinese has translated this line as 普⽣三世福 (pu sheng san shi fu,
“He is the universal source of merits of the three times”).
According to the Tibetan. “That brings joy when seen” is not present in the
Sanskrit or the Chinese. This perhaps derives from a variant of pradyota
(“light”) as pramudita.
Literally jinaurasāḥ (“offspring of the jinas”), translated into Tibetan as rgyal
sras, which is usually the Tibetan for jinaputra (“sons of the jinas”). The
Chinese translates it literally as 佛⼦ (fo zi, “sons of the Buddha”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have translated from a
corrupted manuscript in which akṣaya was replaced by jñāna. The Chinese
has expanded the second part of this verse into two: “gives teaching
unceasingly and widely” and “displays unimpeded discriminating
knowledge” as the second and third lines.
The Sanskrit has just the one verb udita, which is doubled in the Tibetan to
shar shing ’byung (“arisen and appeared”). This reads as byung in Yongle,
Lithang, Kangxi, Narthang, and Choné, which appears more correct for a
past passive participle. The Stok Palace version has byang, which is an error
for byung.
According to the Sanskrit vośodhanaḥ and the Tibetan sbyong in Stok Palace,
Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Choné, and Lhasa. Degé has spyod. The Chinese
interprets it this as 成就智慧⾝ (cheng jiu zhi hui shen, “has attained wisdom
body”).
According to the Tibetan ’od snang gsal ba of Stok Palace, Narthang, and
Lhasa. Other Kangyurs have ’di snang gsal ba. The Sanskrit is candrabhāsvara
(“moonlight”). The Chinese interprets this verse as, “On seeing the supreme
two-legged being, if one can develop vast motivation, they will always be
able to meet the buddhas and increase their power of wisdom.”
According to the Tibetan, which gives the same name as earlier. The Sanskrit
gives an alternate version of his name,

Dharmadhātutalabhedajñānābhijñārāja, which is the version translated into
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit śruti and the Narthang and Lhasa thos. Other
Kangyurs, including Stok Palace and Degé, have mthong (“see”). The
Chinese has expanded this verse into two contrasting scenarios: “remain in
the lower realms but always able to hear the names of the buddhas” versus
“born in higher realms but temporarily unable to hear the names of the
buddhas.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
unintended omissions resulting in “the teaching of the succession of
buddhas in the atoms of all the buddha realms…”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to have
misinterpreted “facing the bodhimaṇḍas” as meaning “the location of
manifesting the essence, enlightenment.” The Chinese translates as 佛坐道場
(fo zuo dao chang, “the bodhimaṇḍas where the buddhas reside”).
According to the Sanskrit arambaṇataleṣu, which the Tibetan translates as
“grounds focused on.”
According to the Sanskrit sama and the Chinese. The Tibetan has “in the
atoms of all realms.”
According to the Sanskrit jina and the Stok Palace, Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi,
Narthang, Choné, and Lhasa rgyal. Degé has rgal.
According to the Sanskrit tatra and the Stok Palace de na. Narthang and Lhasa
have ni. Degé and other Kangyurs have nas (“from”).
According to the Sanskrit syntax. In the Tibetan, “conduct” is separated from
“delightful.” In the Chinese translation, verses 6 and 7 are a continuation of
verse 5, sharing the same subject —the bodhisattvas. The equivalent of this
line appears as the first line in verse 6, 皆住普賢⾏ (jie zhu pu xian xing), which
can be understood as “all maintain excellent conduct” or “all maintain the
conduct of Samanta bhadra.”
The Tibetan translates sāgara here as the gang chen mtsho (“ocean that is big”)
as opposed to rgya mtsho elsewhere. Lithang, Choné, and Lhasa appear to
have “corrected” it to gangs chen mtsho (“ocean of great snow”). The Chinese
has 海 (hai, “ocean”).

According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has sugati (“a happy state”) in the
accusative. The Chinese translation has ⾝雲 (shen yun, “cloud bodies”) as
the subject of the first line, a term that denotes the numberless bodies of
buddhas. The Chinese omits “the sugatas.”
According to the Sanskrit bhūyasyā mātrayā and the Stok Palace and Degé
brnan. Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné have bstan. Not present in the
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit sama and the Chinese. The Tibetan khongs su chud
pa could mean “comprised within.”
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese. Here the Tibetan is presumably
translated from a manuscript that read nāmavarṇa (“name and color”) instead
of the present Sanskrit editions that have nānābala (“various powers”). The
Chinese has “name” and “color” as two features.
According to the Sanskrit pratiṣṭhāna, the Chinese 住處 (zhu chu), and the Stok
Palace, Narthang, and Lhasa gzhi. Other Kangyur have zhing (“realms”).
According to the Sanskrit vyañjana. The Tibetan translates as yi ge (“letters”).
According to the Sanskrit, the Chinese, and the instrumental kyis in the Stok
Palace, Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Urga, and Lhasa Kangyurs. Degé has kyi.
Also, the following part of the sentence is missing in all Kangyurs. The
Chinese has “the great assemblies of bodhisattvas saw…”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. There has been an accidental
omission of most of this and the following sentence in Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. “Directions” is not present in
Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit kāya. The Tibetan is inconsistent, as in conjunction
with “beings” it translates kāya as lus (“body”). The Chinese translates
literally as “body” (⾝, shen): “bodies of all realms,” “bodies of all beings,”
omitting the word “directions.”
According to the Sanskrit saṃjñāgata. The Tibetan translates as mying
(“name”).
There is the inadvertent scribal omission of a few words here so that this and
the following direction in the list have been combined.

shi jian zhu se siang cha bie), which can mean literally “perceiving different
forms (⾊ se, ‘color’) and appearances (相 xiang, ‘appearance’) of all lords in
all worlds.”

tan gyis. The Chinese has 能修⾏如⼀切佛海功德道 (neng xiu xing ru yi qie fa hai
gong de dao, “capable of practicing the path that enters into the ocean of
qualities of all the buddhas”).
From the Sanskrit vamśa, which was translated into Tibetan as rigs and into
Chinese as 種性 (zhong xing).
According to the Sanskrit.

apparently in terms of its meaning “waves.” Not present in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit kṣaṇasaṃbheda. Translated in the Chinese as 普知
(pu zhi, “know fully”). The Tibetan tha myi dad pa appears to have been a
translation from kṣaṇāsaṃbheda.

essence of the body of…” The corresponding Chinese is 法界⾝ (fa jie shen,
“body of the Dharma realm”).

According to the Stok Palace de bzhin gshegs pa thams cad kyis mnan pa’i nyi ma
gnon pa. The Sanskrit divasa could mean simply “day,” divasakara (“day

chang chu xian, “the sun of the buddha(s) appears constantly in all instances
of mind”).

appears to interpret this differently as ⼀⽇中悉知三世所有法 (yi ri zhong xi zhi
san shi suo you fa, “knowing all dharmas of the three times in one day”).

meanings, such as “control,” but not “blessing.” It was translated into

meaning, particularly within the sūtras. The Chinese reads 現⾝ (xian,
“appear,” “manifest”).
According to the Sanskrit. Vimaṇḍala is the term used for the orbit of the sun

activity”).
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese. The latter reads 乘⼤智⾈, 所往無

wisdom, moving without impediment”). The present Sanskrit has gagana

According to the Tibetan gzhol ba and the Chinese. The Sanskrit has
samavasaraṇa (“united,” “brought together”). The Chinese has “there is no
place in any direction that they have not entered.”
From the Sanskrit susūkṣmodāra paramāṇuraja. The Tibetan has “in extremely
minute vast atoms.” Cleary translates from the Chinese as “atomic particles
subtle and gross.” The Chinese simply reads “in each atom.”
According to the Tibetan kha dog myed pa. The Sanskrit suvarṇa gives the
meaning “excellent colors,” which is normally the case in Chinese
translation, but not here.
According to the Sanskrit ekarūpa. The Tibetan has de lta bu’i (“in that way”),
presumably translating from a manuscript that had evarūpa in error for
ekarūpa. Absent in the Chinese.
According to the genitive kyi in Stok Palace, Narthang, and Lhasa.
According to the Sanskrit vṛkṣa (vṛkṣāna is a BHS plural genitive). The Tibetan
has zhing (“realm”) in error for shing (“tree”). Cleary has “trees and flowers.”
The Chinese has 寶樹 (bao shu, “jewel-trees”).
The Tibetan appears to have “are seated and proclaim,” although “those
seated” is in the accusative plural. The Chinese has “in the sky above
Jetavana” and positions it as the first line.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit kṣetrādadhastāt means “from under the
ground of the realms” instead of zhing rnams rgya mtsho’i (“an ocean of
realms”). The Chinese has “as numerous as atoms of all oceans in the ten
directions.”
The Tibetan interprets the compound gandhārci puṣpa as meaning “perfumed
light rays and flowers.” The Chinese lists burning incense 香燄 (xiang yan),
flowers, and treasures.

According to the Sanskrit bhūmi, the Stok Palace shes pa’i sa, and the Narthang
Kangyur’s ye shes pa’i sa. It is missing in the Chinese. Degé has ye shes kyis

and Choné have ye shes pa’i sa bon (“seed of wisdom”).

According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan appears to be
translating from a corrupted text and has “defeats the various kleśas and
predispositions through the method of entering the capabilities of all
beings.”

this into two, of which the second, 開悟 (kai wu, “become enlightened”), can

Yamas”). The Chinese has “palace of the king of Yamas.”

From the Sanskrit praṭimaṇḍala. The Tibetan and the Chinese translate as
“adornment.”
According to the Sanskrit sāgara and the Chinese. Translated into Tibetan as
gang chen mtsho (“the lake that is big”) instead of the usual rgya mtsho (“vast
lake”) as in the Mahāvyutpatti, perhaps because the synonym samudra is
translated as rgya mtsho in this sentence and the translator wished to create a
synonym. This term is made more obscure in Narthang, Choné, and Lhasa,
where it is incorrectly written gangs chen mtsho (“great snow lake”).
The online Sanskrit (Vaidya) has kūṭāgara.
According to the Tibetan thams cad mkhyen pa’i chos, presumably from a
Sanskrit manuscript that had sarvajñadharma. The Chinese has ⼀切智智無上法
城 (yi qie zhi zhi wu shang fa cheng), which can mean “the towns of omniscient
supreme Dharma,” probably a confluence of two Sanskrit terms sarvajñāna
and sarvajñadharma, or “the towns of supreme Buddhadharma” or “the
supreme town of omniscient Dharma.” The present Sanskrit has just
sarvadharma (“all Dharmas”).
According to the BHS avaropita. The Chinese translation emphasizes “planted
deeply.” The Tibetan has bskyed pa (“generated”).
Aṣṭāpada (“eight feet”) was the game board that was the ancestor of checkers
and chess, and like them it consists of a board that is eight horizontal
squares and eight vertical squares in size, resulting in sixty-four squares. It
is a characteristic pattern of the ground in pure realms. In this segment, the
Chinese uses the common term for “road,” 路 (lu), instead of 道 (dao) for
“road” or “path.” The first feature of this road or path is 左右⼋步, 平坦莊嚴
(zuo you ba bu, ping tan zhuang yan, “eight steps to his right and left is flat,
even, and beautified”).
In the Sanskrit and the Chinese, “emit from their ūrṇā hairs.” “From their
ūrṇā hairs” is not present in the Tibetan. The Chinese describes how
buddhas emit light from their ūrṇā hairs when they are about to give
teachings.
From the Sanskrit nipatanti. The Tibetan translates as ’char ba, which could
mean “shine on” or even “rise from.” The Chinese translates as “shine on his
body and enter his body through the crown of his head.”
The Sanskrit has “turned back with the miraculous power of bodhisattvas,”
which is not present in the Tibetan or the Chinese.

From the Sanskrit prāg. The Tibetan translates as lta smos kyang ci smos. The
Chinese reads 況 (kuang).
This repetition in Tibetan is not present in the Sanskrit or the Chinese.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit and the Chinese have “the
residences, the divine palaces, and adornments that were made of a variety
of jewels.”
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese. The Sanskrit has mantra.
From the Tibetan brda’. The BHS Sanskrit saṃjñā can also mean “idea.” The
Chinese has 訓釋 (shi xun), “explanations.”
According to the Sanskrit samanta bhadrāyāṃ bodhi sattva caryāyāṃ. The Tibetan
byang chub sems dpa’ kun tu bzang po’i spyod pa (Yongle and Kangxi have byang
chub sems dpa’i kun tu bzang po’i spyod pa) could be interpreted as “the
bodhisattva Samanta bhadra’s conduct.” The Chinese interprets it as
“established in the mind of bodhisattvas, firmly and unwaveringly.”
According to the Tibetan. “Activities” is not present in the Sanskrit or the
Chinese.
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese, which has 莊嚴幢娑羅樹林 (zhuang
yan chuang suo luo shu lin, “forest of sal trees and majestic banners”). The
Sanskrit has vicitra sāra dhvaja vyūha, translated by Cleary as “Array of Various
Standards of Strength,” translating sāra as “strength.”
Literally, “ten million times a hundred thousand million times a hundred
thousand times ten.” In other words, a million million million million.
From the Sanskrit śreṣṭhi. The Tibetan translates as tshong dpon (“merchant
leader”). The Chinese translation does not have an adjective here.
From the Sanskrit śreṣṭhidāraka. The Tibetan translates as tshong dpon gyi bu,
“son of a head merchant.” The Chinese translates as 童⼦ (tong zi, “youth,”
“youthful”), translating only dāraka and not śreṣṭhin.
From the Sanskrit aṅku. The Tibetan translates as sdong po, which could also
refer to a tree trunk, but that is not the intended meaning here. Also, the
Tibetan analyzes the compound sapta ratnāṅkurāḥ to mean “sprouts of seven
precious materials,” but “seven precious sprouts” matches the context here.
Based on the syntax, the Chinese has interpreted it as 七寶芽 (qi bao ya,
“sprouts made of seven precious jewels”).

From the Sanskrit gamana. The Tibetan seems to have been translated from a
manuscript that read gagana (“space”). The Chinese has “his mind is as pure
as space.”
According to the Sanskrit sarva buddhānanta. The Tibetan has, apparently in
error, “the succession of the buddhas,” which is then repeated as the next
item in the list. The Chinese has ⼀切佛次第法 (yi qie fo ci di fa), which might
be reconstructed as sarva buddhānantara.
According to the Sanskrit vyūha and the irregular Tibetan translation rgyan
that is used in the translation of this sūtra (the translations of other sūtras
use bkod pa) in Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Lhasa, and Stok Palace. Other
Kangyurs have the incorrect rgyud.
According to the Tibetan. The online Sanskrit edition (Vaidya) has nirvāṇa in
error for nirmāṇa. The Chinese has 化導法 (hua dao fa), which could mean
“methods to guide beings.”
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese. The BHS dharma deśanādhiṣṭhānaṃ
prati prasrabhya could mean “having concluded his resolve to teach the
Dharma to the beings…”
According to Tibetan analysis of the compound buddha guṇa māhātmyaṃ. This
could also be “the greatness of the qualities.” The Chinese translation omits
“greatness.”
According to the Sanskrit hitāya. The Tibetan has sman in error for phan, an
error that can occur when transcribing from dbu med script. This verse is
absent from the Chinese.
According to the Tibetan, which takes this as a vocative and places it in the
first line of verse along with “wise one.”
According to the Sanskrit sattva and the Chinese. “All” is not present in the
Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit timira and the Chinese. The Tibetan has the
inexplicable gzings pa.
From the Sanskrit udgata. The Tibetan translates according to its other

From the Sanskrit praṇidhīparākramā and in agreement with the Chinese
interpretation. The Tibetan translates as “power of prayer” (smon lam gyi
mthu), which does not fit the analogy so well.
According to the Sanskrit khaṅga (the same as khaḍga) and the Chinese. The
Tibetan uses the obscure bshan and as a result was copied through listening
to its being read as spyan (“eyes”) in Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, Choné, and
Lhasa.
According to the Tibetan. The Chinese has “always attended.” The online
Vaidya edition has nirvṛta in error for nivṛta. The first two lines in the Chinese
translation have no verbs.
The Sanskrit has upanāmayāhi me (“bring me before the”).
According to the BHS pithanā-supīthita. The Tibetan translates as skyabs kyis
gcad (“block through refuge”).
According to the Sanskrit bala. Translated into Tibetan as the adjective mchog
(“supreme”), perhaps from a text that had vara instead of bala. The third line
in the Chinese reads 智眼悉遠離 (zhi yan xi yuan li, “You, the one with the
eyes of wisdom, are free from both”).
According to the Sanskrit visarada. The Tibetan here translates according to
its BHS meaning of “fearless,” which does not appear to match the context
so well. Here the Chinese translates in accord with the Tibetan, but it
translates the same phrase according to Classical Sanskrit a few verses
further on. In the Chinese, the first two lines become one; the third line
becomes 分別⼼無怯 (fen bie xin wu qie, “able to distinguish, your mind is free
from fear”).
According to the Sanskrit deśaka, the Chinese, and the Narthang and Lhasa
ston. Degé and other Kangyurs have sgron (“lamp”). The Chinese adds the
analogy that the buddhas of the three times reveal the path like the sun
arising in the world.
According to the Sanskrit visarada and the Chinese. The Tibetan here
translates according to its BHS meaning of “fearless,” which does not appear
to match the context so well.

translation 智慧決定⼈ (zhi hui jue ding ren, “the one with unchanging
wisdom”).
From saṃharāhi. The Tibetan translates bstan, which usually translates
darśayāhi (“teach” or “show”). Cleary, translating from the Chinese, has “put
me in.” In the Chinese translation of verses 20–33, the order of the first and
fourth lines is reversed, and the concluding lines of each of these verses
have the same meaning, “Carry me or enable me to travel in this vehicle!”
without any further description of the vehicle.
According to the Sanskrit rājya. Absent from the Chinese. The Tibetan
translates this simply as dam pa (“excellent”), which is the translation in the
next verse for śreṣṭha, but the entire analogy of this verse appears not to have
been understood either in translation or in its transmission.
According to the Sanskrit śayana and the Chinese. The Tibetan has lam
(“path”).
According to the Sanskrit samākula. The Chinese translation is equivalent to
“attended.” The Tibetan has rgyu (“moving”), which matches the path in the
first line, but both appear to be mistranslations.
According to the Tibetan gzer from the BHS śalya, which in Classical Sanskrit
means “lance” or “arrow.” In the Chinese translation, the third line reads 恆
塗淨戒香 (heng tu jing jie xiang, “anointed with the fragrance of pure conduct
all the time”), and the fourth line 忍辱牢莊嚴 (ren ru lao zhuang yan, “adorned
by unshakable patience”).
According to the Tibetan mthu and the Chinese. The online Vaidya has tala
(“plain” or “surface”) apparently in error for bala.
According to the Tibetan thogs med pa, which appears to have been translated
from a text that had a negation of savilambha. According to the Sanskrit and
the Chinese, this line would mean “moving slowly.” In Chinese, the first two
lines have been combined into one, while the third is divided into two: 悲⼼
作徐轉, 所向皆無怯 (bei xin zuo xu zhuan, suo xiang jie wu que, “The mind of
compassion turns slowly. It proceeds in any direction without fear”). The
adverb 徐 (xu) has the connotation of “calmly and graciously.”
In accordance with the Chinese and an assumed Sanskrit mālya. Vaidya has
mārya. The Tibetan sgyu ma (“illusion”) appears to have been translated from
a text that had māya. The Chinese translates as 善巧如幻化 (shan qiao ru huan
hua, “as skillful as magical displays”), with no mention of wisdom.

From the Sanskrit avaraṇa. The Tibetan translates it from its other meaning of
“obscuration,” which does not fit the analogy either. In fact, the Tibetan
translates with two words sgrib dang chags pa, which is reflected in this
translation. The Chinese has ⼀切無障礙 (yi qie wu zhang ai, “completely
without obstructions”).
According to the Sanskrit cakra, which has been translated into the Chinese
as “wheels.” “Circles” is omitted in the Tibetan and replaced by mang
(“many”).
According to the Sanskrit sarva. “All” is omitted in the Tibetan and the
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit gocarai. The Tibetan translates as rab snang ba, which
could be translated into English as “wisdom that illuminates every
direction.” The Chinese is similar to the Tibetan, 智慧滿⼗⽅ (zhi hui man shi
fang, “wisdom that fills [the space in all] the ten directions”).
According to the BHS viyuhāna. The Tibetan translates as klubs (“to
envelop”), which is not found in the Mahāvyutpatti, nor is viyuhāna. In the
Chinese, it is translated as a noun: 莊嚴 (zhuang yan, “splendor”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan and the Chinese omit “wind.”
According to the Sanskrit pura and the Chinese. The Tibetan has gnas
(“place”) instead of “city.” In the Chinese translation, lines two and three are
combined into one. This line becomes 定⼼安隱住 (ding xin an yin zhu, “the
mind is stable and rests in peace”), and it continues with an additional line:
普運諸含識 (pu yun zhu han shi, “transport all those with consciousness”).
According to the Sanskrit mahā mahitalācalopama, and in agreement with the
Chinese (which omits “surface”). The Tibetan here has sa chen bzhi yi stobs kyi
stobs ldan pa (“having the power of the power of four great earths”). bzhi
(“four”) is evidently an error for gzhi (“ground”).
According to the Sanskrit raśmi and the Chinese. The Tibetan omits “light
rays.”
According to vilokayi, the BHS first person optative. Translated into Tibetan
as imperative, “Show me!” The Chinese has translated the fourth line as 願能
慈顧我 (yuan neng ci gu wo, “may you look upon me with kindness!”) and has
“the Dharma king” in a separate line of verse.

According to the Sanskrit nagara. Absent in the Chinese. The Tibetan
translates as pho brang (“palace”).
According to the BHS adhyālambitavyā.
The Sanskrit adds the adjective viśuddha (“pure”).
According to the Tibetan dpal. The Sanskrit ketu can mean “brightness” or
“banner.” The Chinese has 威⼒ (wei li, “splendor,” “power,” and so on).
The Sanskrit punyākara could be translated as a multitude or plentitude of
merit or a source of merit. It is translated into Chinese as 福處 (fu chu, “source
of merit”). The Tibetan has dge (short for dge ba (“virtue”) instead of bsod nams
(“merit”) as in the Sanskrit, probably for the sake of the meter of the verse.
The Sanskrit adjective viśiddhi (“pure”) describes all four descriptions of
merit.
From the Sanskrit singular locative feminine. The Tibetan translates as dative
(“for”), as this locative frequently is used with this meaning but does not
seem to match the context here. Lines three and four are reversed in the
Chinese, which makes the fourth line, 具⾜菩薩⾏ (ju zu pu sa xing), as a result
of the third line, likely to mean “perfect the bodhisattva conduct.”
According to one of the meanings of the BHS śodhayiṣyasi, and in agreement
with the Chinese. The Tibetan translates as “purify.”
According to the BHS adhyālambitavyā.
According to the Sanskrit utsaṅga or autsaṅga and the Chinese. The Tibetan
may have translated from a text that had auṣadha as sman ljongs (“valley of
herbs”).
According to the BHS adhyālambitavyā.
According to the Tibetan rgyud. Sanskrit has pracāra (“conduct,” “activity”).
According to the Sanskrit loka kṛpā and in accordance with the Chinese. The
Tibetan snang ba’i snying rje (“the compassion of light”) is peculiar and
appears to have been translated from a text that had bodhisattvāloka kṛpā,
which would include āloka (“light”) instead of loka (“world”). The Chinese
has “manifesting the bodhisattva’s activities for the world.”
According to the Sanskrit vijñāpana. The Tibetan translates as dmigs par mdzad
pa (“focusing on,” “perceiving,” “visualizing,” “observing,” and so on).

From one meaning of the BHS āragaṇa. The Tibetan, with mnyes par bya ba,
translates according to the alternative meaning of “propitiate” or “please,”
which does not appear to match the context. The Chinese omits “the
accomplishment of.”
According to the Tibetan. “Resounding with their voices” is not present in
the Sanskrit and the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. “Will explain it to you” is omitted
in the Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit bhūmi and the Chinese 位 (wei). “Level” is omitted
in the Tibetan.
According to the Tibetan.
From the BHS anumārjan. The Tibetan translates as rjes su sbyang ba (“trained
in”).
According to the Tibetan.
The Sanskrit āvartante means “to turn toward” in contrast to vivratante,
“turning away” from saṃsāra. The Tibetan ’grub pa is literally “accomplish”
or “attain,” which is more properly used to translate sampadyante in relation
to the family of the tathāgatas in this same paragraph, and therefore may be
translated from a manuscript that had sampadyante here instead of āvartante.
From the Tibetan rgyud. The Sanskrit srotas can also mean “river.”
The Sanskrit āvartante means “to turn toward.” The Tibetan translates as ’jug
(“enter”). The Chinese translates as 成 (cheng, “attain”).
From the Sanskrit dyotayanti … prabhavam, which could be translated as
“illuminating the majesty of.” The Chinese omits “the arising of.”

According to the Sanskrit abhimukha, the Chinese 專念不捨 (zhuan nian bu she,
with the connotation of “not abandoning”) and ’dun pa in Narthang. The
other Kangyurs have ’dug.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan and the Chinese omit “to dispel
wisdom’s obscurations.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. “Deeper” is omitted in the
Tibetan.
The BHS here is kalika, which, although Monier-Williams defines it as “bud,”
is related to the Classical Sanskrit karṇika and the Pali kaṇṇika. The Daśa -
bhūmika Sūtra has the exact same kind of lotus, with a sapphire stem, gold
leaves, emerald stamens, and a sandalwood pericarp.
Throughout this passage the number is literally “ten hundred thousand.”
“Pure merit” (Sanskrit punyaśuddha) may well be a euphemism for a
particular kind of jewel.
If “radiant” (Sanskrit vairocana) is a euphemism for a particular kind of jewel,
as vairocana also means “the sun,” this could be referring to the sunstone.
The Sanskrit here is the less familiar synonym Jambudhvaja translated as 閻浮
幢 (yan fu chuang) in the Chinese. The Tibetan has ’dzam bu’i chu (“Jambu
River”).
The word for “diamond” here is vajrasiṃha (“vajra lion”); rdo rje’i seng ge in the
Tibetan, ⾦剛師⼦ (jin gang shi zi) in the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit bhāsana. The Tibetan has brjod (“describe”) in error for brjid.
The Chinese has “profundity” instead of “the majestic radiance.”
According to the Tibetan, which is in agreement with the Chinese 無⾒頂相
(wu jian ding xiang). The Sanskrit has avalokita-mūrdhita (“the visible crown of
his head”).
From the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has “bases and different aspects.” The
Chinese has “all the supreme Dharmas of the buddhas” ⼀切諸佛妙法 (yi qie
zhu fo miao fa).
From the BHS samavasaraṇa. The Tibetan interprets this as an additional verb,
gzhol ba (“descend” or “be absorbed in”). The Chinese translates samavasaraṇa
as ⼊ (ru, “enter”), and has “all Dharma wheels.”

According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan omits “in order to
communicate wisdom; they have entered the ocean of all good qualities.”
The Chinese repeats “the ocean of the minds of all beings.”
From the Sanskrit vijñapana. The Tibetan translates as rig pa (“know”). The
Chinese has 能以智慧咸悟⼊ (neng yi zhi hui xian wu ru, “communicate
wisdom and awaken all beings”).
The Sanskrit avagāhyamāna has the stronger meaning of “being immersed in.”
From the Sanskrit āvarta. The Tibetan translation has le’u dang (“chapters
and”) glong in all available editions of the Kangyur, apparently in error for
klong (“expanse,” “whirlpool”) as in the Chinese translation 漩澓 (xuan fu,
“whirlpools and undercurrents”).
This could possibly be an incorrect Sanskritization of the Middle-Indic dīpa,
which could mean both “continent” and “lamp.”
According to the Tibetan gnas. The Sanskrit patha primarily means “road” but
could also mean “region.”
According to the Tibetan. “In beautiful colors” is not present in the Sanskrit
or the Chinese.
The Sanskrit reads “human form and strength.” Yongle and Kangxi have kha
(“faces”) instead of kha dog (“color”). The male garuḍas are omitted in Cleary.
The Chinese has 童⼦形 (tong zi xing, “youthful form”).
According to the Tibetan dga’. The Sanskrit has parama (“highest”), according
with the Chinese (Cleary: “uppermost in their minds,” p. 1186).
“Nonviolence” according to the Sanskrit avihiṃsā and the Chinese 無殺⼼ (wu
sha xin, “nonkilling”), which according to the Mahāvyutpatti should be ’tshe ba
med pa in Tibetan. Yongle and Kangxi have the error bsod pa med. Choné has
rtsod pa med (“without quarrel or conflict”), while Lithang has the error brtsod
pa med.

(“teach”) in error for brten pa or bsnyen pa.

From the Sanskrit bhāvayitava, translated into Tibetan as bsgom (“meditate”)
and into Chinese as 修⾏ (xiu xing, “practice”).
According to the BHS paripiṇḍayitavya (in agreement with the Chinese),
which is elsewhere translated as bsdus pa. Here the Tibetan translates as
yongs su brtul (“subjugate,” “tame”).
From the Sanskrit paribhāvayitava (in agreement with the Chinese), translated
into Tibetan as bsgom (“meditate”).
According to the Tibetan. In the Sanskrit this is a second half of the previous
sentence: “…through accomplishing all the activities of a bodhisattva.”
According to the Tibetan tshul (“way,” “manner”). The Sanskrit has dhyātā
(“contemplation,” “reflection”).
The interpretation of the relationship between the different elements of the
passage follows the Tibetan. The Vaidya punctuation interprets this
differently. In the Chinese, the verbs used are slightly differently, but the
overall meaning is very similar.
“Hour” here translates muhurta, but as there are thirty muhurta in a day, this
“hour” is forty-eight minutes long.
According to the Tibetan. Not present in the Sanskrit.

Sanskrit: śatasahasra; Tibetan: brgya phrag stong.
Sanskrit: koṭi; Tibetan: bye ba.
Sanskrit: koṭīśata; Tibetan: bye ba brgya.
Sanskrit: koṭisahasra; Tibetan: bye ba stong.
According to the Tibetan bye ba brgya phrag stong (“a hundred thousand ten
millions”). The Sanskrit koṭī śata sahasra is missing in the available edition.
Sanskrit: koṭī niyuta śata sahasra; Tibetan: bye ba khrag khrig brgya phrag stong.
According to the Mahāvyutpatti, niyuta can mean either sa ya (“a million”),
which is its value in Classical Sanskrit, or khrag khrig (“a hundred thousand
million”). The Tibetan translates here as khrag khrig, resulting in the entire
number having the value of a hundred sextillion. One expects the numbers
to be successively greater, but either value of niyuta would result in a greater
value than the next number, which is kiṃkara. However, this passage appears
to conform to the value of the bodhisattva numbers as given in chapter 15,
from this point on. There is much scribal variation in the lists in various
Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of both chapters, but in this translation there
has been an attempt to make the list consistent in both chapters 10 and 15,
where nayuta is translated as tha dgu and has the value of ten thousand
trillion trillion.
The Sanskrit is kaṅkara in Vaidya and kaṅkala in Suzuki. The Tibetan is thams
thams, its general value being a hundred nayuta in BHS (in the Abhidharmakośa
it is a thousand niyuta). However, in the Avataṃsaka it has a different value.

chapter 15 it is kiṃkara. The Mahāvyutpatti dictionary has both kaṃkara and

description of the aspiration to hold the Dharma wheels of all buddhas,
which is what came next in the earlier list.

(“realm of space”). The Chinese has “world realms.”
According to the Sanskrit aśoka and the Chinese. The Tibetan has “without
kleśas,” perhaps from a corrupted manuscript.
The Vaidya Sanskrit here has Samudravetalā. Cleary uses this name. The
Tibetan rnam par rlob pa is the same as earlier, suggesting that it is not
another place with a new name. The Chinese translates as 海潮處 (hai chao
chu, “a place by the ocean”), probably from Samudra-vetāḍin.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. Omitted in the Tibetan.

The Tibetan appears to have translated this as an adjective (“very powerful”)
for the vajra rather than the vajra’s owner. Nārāyaṇa here is ostensibly used
as an alternative name for Indra. The Chinese omits “unbreakable” and
“vajra” and translates the phrase as 寶莊嚴 (bao zhuang yan), a compound of
the adjectives “precious” and “majestic” or of the nouns “jewel” and
“ornament.”
From the Sanskrit suvibhakta. The Chinese has 處處⾏列 (chu chu hang lie,
“rows [of sandalwood trees] everywhere”).
According to the Sanskrit. These two sentences are joined into one in the
Tibetan as a result of an omission: “From all four directions there is the
adornment of the beautifully grown bignonia trees.” The Chinese is similar
to the Tibetan but without the description “beautifully grown.”

(“heap”).

nian), which can mean a hundred thousand years or sometimes a far higher
number of years according to context.

as “signs and knowledge.” The Chinese has 諸佛無量智慧 (zhu fo wu liang zhi
hui, “immeasurable wisdom of the buddhas”).
According to the Sanskrit lakṣaṇa. The Tibetan and the Chinese have skad cig
gcig (“one instant”), apparently translating from a manuscript that had kṣana
instead of lakṣana.
According to the Sanskrit śarīra. The Tibetan translates as rang bzhin
(“nature”).
According to the Sanskrit tryadhva. The Tibetan and the Chinese omit “the
three times.”

Palace have mnyan pa thams cad (“all that is heard”), perhaps translating from
a Sanskrit manuscript that had sarvaśrava or sarvaśruta. The Chinese has 凡所
聞法皆能忍受, 清淨信解 (fan suo wen fa jie neng ren shou, qing jing xin jie, “He
could retain all the Dharmas he had heard and understand with pure faith”),

’khod pa (“arranged with rows of razor blades”). Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, and

Skt. nirvikalpa-jñāna, niṣkalpanā-jñāna, avikalpa-jñāna, “nonconceptual
wisdom”). See Cheng Guan 澄觀. Da fangguang fohuayan jingshu ⼤⽅廣佛華嚴

that he had cut off all obscurations and attained realization. See Cheng Guan

the Mahāvyutpatti. The tshig mdzod chen mo (Tibetan–Chinese dictionary)
states that lan kan is Chinese for pu shu, which the Mahāvyutpatti equates with
harmya. Earlier in this translation lan kan was used to translate harmya.
From the Sanskrit vedīka. This is translated into Tibetan as stegs bu
(“platform”).

From the Tibetan gnas rnam pa tha dad pa, while gnas could have other
meanings, including “locations.” The Sanskrit has adhimātratā
(“excessiveness”). Cleary has “measurelessness.” The Chinese has 差別相
(cha bie xiang), one of the common translations of adhimātratā. Here it can
mean “different aspects.”
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has “all Dharma
clouds.”
According to the Sanskrit aṅgkura, the Chinese 根芽 (gen ya), and the Lhasa
myu gu. Other Kangyurs have myi gu, mi gu, and mgu ba.
According to the Tibetan ’phags pa’i tshogs kyi dkyil ’khor, presumably
translating from a manuscript that read sarvārya maṇḍala gaṇa. The Sanskrit has
sarvārtha maṇḍala gaṇa (“the circle, or field, of all benefits, or goals”) and the
Chinese concurs.
According to the Sanskrit apaśyat and the Chinese. Omitted in the Tibetan.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “the banner of the power over all
sensations.” In the Chinese translation, the 60-volume edition names the first
two samādhis as 覺⼀切 (jue yi qie, “realizing all,” “aware of all”) and 奇特幢
(qi te chuang, “amazing banner”). The 80-volume edition starts with 了⼀切希
有相 (liao yi qie xi you xiang, “seeing clearly all rare aspects”).
The Tibetan appears to have been translating from a manuscript that had
sarva jagad dhita so that it has ’gro ba thams cad dang bral ba. In the Chinese
translation, the 60-volume edition has 遠離⼀切眾⽣ (yuan li yi qie zhong sheng,
“separated from all beings”). The 80-volume edition has 遠離⼀切世間 (yuan li
yi qie shi jian, “separated from all worlds”). The Sanskrit sarva jagad dhita means
“benefit of all beings.”
This could mean power over a million devas or worlds. Mahābrahmā is in the
form realm, and his paradise extends over many world systems and their
desire-realm paradises, to the extent of a thousand million. Therefore, that
may be what is meant here. The Tibetan does not state what the number
refers to and translates as “does not engage in the kleśas of the desire
realm.” Cleary has unspecified “gods” who “live in the realm of desire.” In
the Chinese translation, the 80-volume edition does not specify whether it
was one million devas or one million desire realms. The 60-volume edition
mentions neither the number nor the objects.
From the BHS paribhāvitā. The Tibetan translates as bsgom (“meditate” or
“cultivate”). The Sanskrit paribhāvitā is often translated in the Chinese as 深修

(shen xiu) or 勤習 (qin xi), both of which can mean “practice deeply” or “study
diligently.” Here it is translated simply as 修⾏ (xiu xing, “practice”).
According to the Sanskrit indra. The Tibetan has rgyal po (“king”) here, but
very soon in this chapter translates as dbang (“lord”). To maintain
consistency it has been translated as “lord” here. The Chinese interprets this
line as 光明照世間 (guang ming zhao shi jian, “brilliant light illuminates the
world”). Here “brilliant light” might refer to the clarity of her mind or the
splendor of her qualities.
The Sanskrit here for “mountain” is acala (literally, “immovable”) and is a
play on words in reference to her name, Acalā, which is lost in translation.
According to the Tibetan gzhi and the later repetition of this term in Sanskrit
as tala. At this point the Sanskrit has tattva (“true nature”) and Cleary accords.
Omitted in the Chinese. Carré translates as tous les enseignements (“all the
teachings”).
According to the Tibetan gzhi and the later repetition of this term in Sanskrit
as tala, with which Cleary concurs. At this point the Sanskrit has tattva (“true
nature”) and Cleary accords. The Tibetan translates as gzhi (“basis”). The
Chinese repeats only the first and fifth gateways, “from … to.”
From the Tibetan yid chas and in accord with the Chinese. The Sanskrit has
the BHS adhimokṣa (“dedication to”). In the Chinese, the 80-volume edition
has 難知 (nan zhi), “difficult to know or understand,” and the 60-volume
edition adds 難說 (nan shuo), “difficult to explain or express.”
According to the Sanskrit duhitā, the narrative, and the Chinese. The Tibetan
translates as the obscure feminine term bu cig ma, which appears to be
another way of writing bu mo gcig pa, though it could be interpreted in
Tibetan to be the feminine form of bu gcig pa “only child.”
From the Tibetan mi nyal. The Sanskrit has rātryāṃ praśāntāyāṃ (“on a silent
night”). Not present in the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit rājapura (which could also mean “the king’s city,” “the
king’s palace,” or “the king’s apartments”). The Tibetan has just rgyal po’i sgo
(“the king’s door”), so that there appears to have been an omission. Not
present in the Chinese.
The Tibetan appears to have translated from a manuscript with a scribal
corruption. It has mi zad pa (“unceasing,” which would be from akṣaya).
Narthang and Lhasa have mi bzad (“unbearable” or “inexhaustible,” which

could, according to the Mahāvyutpatti, be from viṣama). The Sanskrit has viṣaya

惡眾⽣ (jiu e zhong sheng), “save beings from unfavorable conditions.”
According to the Sanskrit abhilaṣantī and the Chinese 求 (qiu). The Tibetan
translates as dad pa (“having faith in”).
According to the Tibetan dran pa and the Chinese 念 (nian). The BHS is
abhijānāti. Edgerton gives the meaning as “know” and “recognize” and
thinks that Burnouf and Kern (who translated The Lotus Sūtra from Sanskrit)
were wrong in interpreting the word as “remember.”
According to the Sanskrit vismartum and the Chinese 忘失 (wang shi). The
Tibetan has brjod (“speak,” “describe”) in error for brjed (“forget”).
According to the Sanskrit vismartum and the Chinese 忘失 (wang shi). The
Tibetan has brjod (“speak,” “describe”) in error for brjed (“forget”).
From the Sanskrit agraha and the Chinese 執著 (zhi zhuo). The Tibetan has rab
kyi ’du shes (“highest identification”), presumably translating from a
manuscript that had the error agra.

“inferior or superior”). The Tibetan has bzang ngan gyi ’du shes (“identification
as good or bad”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese ⽣死海 (sheng si hai, “ocean of
births and deaths”). The Tibetan has chos kyi rgya mtsho (“ocean of Dharma”).
According to the Tibetan lha yi dbang po, translated from surendra. Vaidya
assumes an elided initial a, which would result in “lord of the asuras,”
though it does not appear to fit the context in the Tibetan where asuras are
being vanquished. However, in the Chinese translation, the 80-volume
edition has the lord of the asuras “who can subjugate the ocean of kleśas
throughout the great cities of the three realms,” 遍撓動三有⼤城煩惱海 (bian
nao dong san you da cheng fan nao hai). Carré has roi des asuras, and Cleary “lord
of the asuras.”
From the Tibetan brjod pa, presumably from the Sanskrit varṇitam. Not present
in Vaidya.
From the Tibetan yongs su bsgom pa, which would have been translating
paribhāvita. Not present in Vaidya or the Chinese, where the list is shorter.

According to the Sanskrit samīkurvan and most Kangyurs, which read mnyam
par bya ba byed pa. Degé has the error mnyam par bya ba myed pa. Cleary
translates as “living up to it.” Not present in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit dhāraṇi, the Narthang and Stok Palace gzungs, and
the Chinese 陀羅尼 (tuo luo ni). Other Kangyurs have the error gzugs (“form”).

(“noose splitting”). The Chinese has 九⼗六眾 (jiu shi liu zhong, “ninety-six
groups of individuals”).

According to the Sanskrit svabhāva and the Chinese. The Tibetan has rang

nature of all phenomena”), omitting the term wisdom.
According to the BHS Sanskrit madapramāda. Mada can also mean “pride.”
Both meanings were translated into the Chinese as 憍逸 (jia yi).
The Sanskrit nāga is used as a synonym for “elephant,” but the phrase
nāgsaṃkṣobha occurs a little later in this text in reference to nāgas. In this case,
however, it may refer specifically to cobras, as nāga in India is the name both
for the cobra and the deity, which is a “cobra deity.” What is being referred
to here may be the confrontations that occurred in India between elephants
and cobras. The Chinese translates the name of the perfume by “elephant”
象藏 (xiang zang) in association with “nāgas” (⿓, long).
The Degé print has here page 594 (folio 297.b) in error for 94 (folio 47.b). The
page number has been emended in the Degé reader.
This refers to infantry, chariots, cavalry, and elephants.

According to the Sanskrit śubhonavyūha. The Tibetan rnam par ’byed pa means
“differentiation.” Carré, translating from the Chinese, has Pur Ornament, and
therefore the Chinese may have been translating from a text that had
śuddhovyūha.

obscure thag thug. The Chinese lists four sets of opposites: upward-
downward (literally, “high-low”), safe-dangerous, clean-dirty, and crooked-

and unpleasant”).
According to the Tibetan and the French translation of the Chinese. Vaidya

pa (“become high [or] low”).
From the Sanskrit mati. Translated into Tibetan as nan tan (“diligent
practice”), perhaps from a text that read pratipatti.
Simplified from the Sanskrit saṃbhavahetu and the corresponding Tibetan
’byung ba’i rgyu, which would literally be “the cause of the arising of” as in
the Chinese ⽣⼤智因 (sheng da zhi yin).
The Tibetan interpretation of the compound could be taken to mean “various
gateways and continuums” (with rgyud translating āvartanaya). In Chinese,
this and the preceding phrase are conjoined as one, and āvartanaya is
translated as 旋 (xuan, “revolving”).
According to the Tibetan (though it translates this part of the compound as
“cause of the arising of and the purity of” instead of “the pure arising of”).
Viśuddhi is not present in the Vaidya Sanskrit in this sentence but is in the

From the Sanskrit praivarjana. The Tibetan translates as bkol ba (“use,”
“employ”).

According to the BHS meaning of nimṇa, which can mean “aiming at” or
“leading to.” Otherwise it has the meaning “downward,” and therefore this
compound nimnonnata can mean “up and down” or “high and low.” The
Tibetan appears to have tried to make sense of this by adding a negative thur
med (“not downward”). It is possible to interpret the phrase to mean “the

Chinese translates as 我慢 (wo man, “self-pride”) and repeats an alternative
translation of the term simply as 我 (wo) in the next short phrase.
According to the Sanskrit mamakārotsargāya and the Chinese 我所 (wo suo). Its
translation appears to be missing from the Tibetan.

sun disk of the great wisdom, and so on, manifested.”

According to the Sanskrit pariśuddhi. The Tibetan has sbyor ba, apparently a
scribal error for sbyong ba. The Chinese translation follows the Sanskrit
pariśuddhhi (清淨, qing jing) but expands the phrase to include other details.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has vijñaptinaya, which in BHS could
mean “the ways of proclaiming” or “the ways of requesting the perfection of
knowledge.”
The Sanskrit adds at this point, “the ways of an ocean of the perfection of
knowledge.” Not present in the Tibetan.
The division of this list is according to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to
have ldan pa’i in error for ldan pa, thus conjoining two elements in the list.

chos). The Chinese translates as 所知法 (suo zhi fa), “knowledge of Dharma”

From the Sanskrit sarasvati, perhaps here meaning “a flow” or “pith.” The
Tibetan dbyings usually translates dhātu. It is possible that the Tibetan was
originally dbyangs. The Chinese omits this term, conjoining this phrase with
the subsequent one as 得他⼼智知眾⽣⼼ (de ta xin zhi zhi zhong sheng xin,
“attaining the knowledge of the minds of other beings (translating from para-
citta-jñānam) and knowing the minds of beings”).

have rgya mtsho (“ocean”).

unusual dharmata (cf. dharmatā “true nature”).
According to the Tibetan sems can, presumably translating sattvan. The
Sanskrit has sarvān (“all”). The Chinese translates as “all beings.”
Literally, “ten million (koṭi; bye ba) times a hundred thousand million (nayuta;
khrag khrig).” In other words, a million million million. The Chinese has “one
million nayuta times one koṭi” (10  according to the definition given in both
Śikṣānanda’s fascicle 30 and Prajñā’s fascicle 10).
41
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has “hundred” (brgya) instead of
hundred thousand million (nayuta; khrag khrig), so it would be only a hundred
million million. The number quintillion in Tibetan is literally “ten million (koṭi;
bye ba) times a hundred thousand million (nayuta; khrag khrig),” i.e., a million
million million.

beings. According to the Avataṃsaka sūtra one koṭinayuta would be 10 .

Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit abhirata. The Tibetan translates as dad dga’.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has rgyal ba (jina) instead of bde bar
gshegs pa, presumably because of the verse meter. This line is absent in the
Chinese.

sequential number, so this is “the tenth.”

translating from a manuscript that had viśuddha (“purified”).

There are three compounds in this verse. This compound, which in the
Sanskrit is in the nominative case, has been chosen to be the name of the
realm. This is because in other verses the names of realms are given in the
nominative case. The other two compounds, which are in the accusative
case, are translated as descriptions of “realm,” which is also in the accusative
case. However, the Tibetan translation chose Samanta prabha megha, “constant
shining clouds,” as the name of the realm. The Chinese has, as the first three
lines, “After that came a kalpa named 寂靜慧 (ji jing hui, “Peaceful/Tranquil
Wisdom”), and the pure realm named ⾦剛寶 (jin gang bao, “Precious Vajra”).”
From the Sanskrit vibuddhi. The Tibetan has dag, presumably translating from
a manuscript that read viśuddhi. The Chinese here gives names for the kalpa
and the realm.

gives names for the kalpa and the realm.
According to the Tibetan chags med. Not present in the Sanskrit. The Chinese
has 無礙 (wu ai), “free of obstacles.”

from a manuscript that had śirirāja (a BHS form of śrīrāja). The Chinese has 功
德王 (gong de wang), presumably translating from śirirāja as well; and very
likely, to distinguish from it, Guṇa rāja is translated as 佛功德王 (fo gong de
wang), adding 佛 (fo, “Buddha”) at the beginning of the name. The Sanskrit
has Girirāja (“Mountain King”).
The Tibetan (including Stok 644) mtshan gyi appears to be a scribal error for
mtshan ri.
According to the Sanskrit, the Lhasa and Stok Palace chos dbang rgyal po, and
the Chinese 法⾃在 (fa zi zai). Degé and others have chos dbyangs rgyal po
(Dharma ghoṣa rāja).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has narendra (“lords of humans”). The
Chinese has 佛 (fo, “buddhas”).
The Tibetan has zhing (“realm”) in error for zhi (“peace”), which would be the
translation for śanta. The Chinese has 寂靜⾳ (ji jing yin, “Peaceful Voice”).
The Sanskrit is sura, which is a synonym of deva. “Lords of devas and
humans” is absent from the Chinese.

According to the Tibetan. The Tibetan dpal appears to be translated from
Śiripradīpa (BHS equivalent to Śrīpradipa). The present Sanskrit has giri and
divides the compound into two names. The Chinese has 功德海 (gong de hai,
“Ocean of Merit”), which is the same as Sāgara śrī in verse 69.
According to the Tibetan rgyal ba, translated into the Chinese as 佛 (fo,
“buddha”). The Sanskrit has narendra (“lord of humans”).
According to the BHS nigarjasu. The Tibetan translates as bshad pa. The
Chinese has 說 (shuo, “explained,” “taught”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has “the adornment of compassion”
instead of “the essence of compassion,” and this occurs in the third line
instead of the first. The Chinese has the last two lines as “the increase of the
aspiration to enlightenment and the accomplishment of the strengths of
tathāgatas.”
According to the Tibetan and also the Chinese (with “self” and “purity”
reversed in order).
According to Lhasa ldongs. The Degé reads mdongs (“face,” “appearance”).
The Chinese has 覆 (fu, “covered by”).
According to the Tibetan. The Chinese has 往來貪欲海 (wang lai tan yu hai,

According to the Tibetan yangs, presumably translating from a manuscript
that had vipula. The present Sanskrit has vimala (“stainless”). The Chinese
has “all wheels of Dharma.”
According to the Sanskrit, and the earlier and following version in Tibetan.
Here, the Tibetan has yon tan (“qualities”) instead of shugs (“power”), which
would be the correct translation for vega. The Chinese omits “power” here.
This list according to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has a variant list, as does the
Chinese.
According to the Tibetan rjes su sems pa, which appears to have translated
anucintena. The present Sanskrit has anugatena (“following”). Based on the
Chinese syntax, the search for Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī starts with the
phrase ⼀⼼願得⾒善知識 (yi xin yuan de jian shan zhi shi, “wished with single-
minded resolution to see the kalyāṇamitra”).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have “the domain of the
faculty of contemplating seeing a kalyāṇamitra.” In the Chinese, the phrases
“without forgetting it even for one moment” and “with all faculties
undistracted” belong to the description of how Sudhana was remembering
and honoring the teaching received from Pramudita nayana jagad virocanā.
According to the Sanskrit samudācāreṇa. Not present in the Tibetan or the
Chinese.
According to the Degé mthu, translating the Sanskrit vikrama. Yongle,
Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné do not have mthu (“power”). With the omission
of a shad marker, the Tibetan appears to conjoin this with the following
quality, although there is no genitive particle to do so. This and the
preceding phrase are absent in the Chinese.
From the BHS ekotībhāvagata. The Tibetan translates as rgyud kyi tshul gcig tu
gyur pa, which could be translated as “being of one mind with.” In the
Chinese this appears to be part of the first phrase describing the search for
Samanta sattva trāṇojaḥ śrī.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan omits the word “all,” resulting in “the
roots of merit of being of one mind with.” Not present in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have an error, reading “the
area called the samādhi that is completely free of dust.” The Chinese has 究竟清淨
輪 (jiu jing qing jing lun, “the cakra of ultimate purity”).

According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit states that there are beings in those
realms. Here the Chinese describes how Sudhana saw all the worlds,
dwelling on five “earth wheels” 地輪 (di lun).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit does not have “and nonhumans.” The
Chinese appears to have split this phrase into two: 諸趣輪轉 (zhu qu lun
zhuan, “rotation of the wheel of realms”) and ⽣死往來 (sheng si wang lai,
“migration between life and death”).
According to the Tibetan and the Chinese. There appears to be an omission
in the Sanskrit.
The Sanskrit at this point also has “focused on the creation of all good
actions.” The Chinese and Tibetan do not have this phrase.
The Sanskrit has “gazed upon her face.” The Chinese has ⼀⼼瞻仰 (yi xin
zhan yang, “[gazed upon her] respectfully and one-pointedly”).
According to the Sanskrit vipula and the Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, Narthang,
Lhasa, and Stok Palace yangs. Degé has yang. The Chinese has 尊妙 (zun miao,
“excellent and beautiful”), migrating adjectives from the second line.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit translates as “adorned with the
jewels of the excellent signs.” The Tibetan has bris pa (“painted”), which
might be a scribal error for spras pa as a translation of ābharaṇa, or perhaps a
translation of citravicitra. The Chinese has “adorned with various signs,”
omitting adjectives.
According to the Sanskrit anupama. The Tibetan, as it does not have the
negative, has “in the manner of examples.” The Chinese has 微妙 (wei miao,
“excellent,” “marvelous”).
According to the Tibetan. BHS ābhakūṭu, i.e., abhakūṭa, would mean “a mass of
light,” as in Cleary, “multitude of lights.” Carré, translating from the
Chinese, has entre-sourcils (“between the eyebrows”). The Tibetan has phrag
pa’i lhun po (“mass of the shoulders”). The Chinese has 兩眉 (liang mei, “two
eyebrows”), which can be understood as a reference to “between the
eyebrows,” as in verse 10.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan interprets the compound as “clouds
of mists and vast suns.”
According to the Tibetan, presumably translating from vimalāt. The Sanskrit
has vimalāḥ, making “stainless” an adjective for “the clouds of suns,” as in

san you hai, “liberate [beings from] the ocean of the three states of existence”).
The Sanskrit is pratyekajina. The Chinese has 三乘 (san sheng, “three yānas”).

body”). The Chinese translates as 體 (ti, “body”) but can also mean “mass.”

Other Kangyurs (including Stok) have ’dren (“led”).
From the Tibetan ’bru, translating kośa. The Chinese has 奇寶 (qi bao, “rare
jewels”).
According to the Sanskrit subhikṣa. The Tibetan translates as rtag tu lo legs
(“always good harvests”), which could seem to contradict the earlier
description of spontaneous harvests. The Chinese has 豐 (feng, “abundance,”
“good harvests”).
According to the Sanskrit virāṇāṃ, the Chinese 勇健 (yong jian, “courageous
and strong”), and the Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Choné, Lhasa, and Stok

According to the Sanskrit parasainya pramardakānāṃ. The Tibetan translates
obscurely as gzhan gyi ’khor.
From the Tibetan and the Sanskrit. Cleary omits this. Carré has “born at the
same time as the cakravartin.” The Chinese is 與王 … 同時誕⽣ (yu wang …
tong shi dan sheng).
According to the Sanskrit pariṇāyaka. The Tibetan has just blon po (“minister”).
The Chinese has 良⾂ (liang chen, “good ministers,” “virtuous ministers”).
According to the Sanskrit abhinīlanetra. The Tibetan translates as “black and
white.” The Chinese has ⽬髮紺青 (mu fa gan qing, “eyes and hair in reddish
black”), which is the same as the color of the Buddha’s eyes and hair.
According to the Tibetan and the later mention of her name in Sanskrit. The
Sanskrit manuscript may have had a scribal error resulting in the name
concluding with śrīr nāma cakravartin instead of śrīcandra. The Tibetan omits
the reference to her being a cakravartin’s daughter.

According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit states, “There was no definite
lifespan. There was no death during it.” Carré’s translation agrees with the
Tibetan. Cleary’s translation agrees with the Sanskrit. The Chinese has 或有
不定⽽早夭者 (huo you bu ding er zhong yao zhe, “Some had unstable conditions
or uncertain lifespan and met an early death”).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “made of the kings of jewels.”

“the first kalpa” (bskal pa’i thog ma). The Chinese has “the first buddha among
them.”

The Tibetan rin po che here is the noun “jewel” and not the adjective

wheel that follows the list of benefits for beings in the Tibetan. Not present
in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan has the plural. The Chinese has ⼀切
(yi qie, “all,” “everything,” “everywhere”).
From the Sanskrit maṣi. The Tibetan translates according to its alternative
meaning as “ink,” though it is not liquid that is meant here. It could mean a
block of ink. The “lampblack powder” (also called “powder black”) was

contemplates the nature of all phenomena”).

pratyakṣa.
From the BHS adhyālamabanatāyai (“acquire,” “attain,” “grasp”) in the dative
case. The Tibetan translates as lhag par dmyigs pa (“perceive,” “focus on”;

of her prayers is “to purify all buddha realms.”

banner.”

translation of vimāna. The present Sanskrit has vinaya (“training,”
“guidance”). The Chinese has ⾨ (men, “gates”).

(ling zhong sheng su ji qu yu yi qie zhi gu, “because it brings beings to
omniscience swiftly”).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit and Carré’s translation from Chinese
are very different from the Tibetan and each other. The Sanskrit is obscure
and possibly corrupt, reading vyūha naya vāta maṇḍala. Carré’s French

the scribal transmission of the Tibetan or the Sanskrit manuscript it was
translated from. Present in the Chinese.

many other meanings. Here it has the meaning as in gatiṃgata.

the Tibetan, resulting in an unintelligible sentence. The Chinese refers to it

According to the Sanskrit avabhāso 'rkasamo (avabhāsa arkasama, “light as bright
as the sun”). The Chinese concurs. The Tibetan has gdugs, which is normally
“parasol” but can also mean “sun.”
According to the Sanskrit, and in accord with the pond architecture of India

palace of the good Dharma in the middle of that central pond.” “Middle” was
added, presumably to fit in with the king’s reaching out for the lotus.

According to the Sanskrit suciraṃ and the Chinese 良久 (liang jiu). Not
present in the Tibetan unless it is translated as rgyangs bcad pa.
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit compound could be translated as
“commonality of the kalyāṇamitras.” The following long section on
“commonality” is interpreted quite differently in Cleary and in Carré via the
Chinese. The Tibetan phyir could be translated as either “because” or “in
order to,” but the Sanskrit is clearly in the dative case and therefore has the
latter meaning. However, Carré translates as puisqu’il (“because”). The
Chinese has 於善知識⽣⼗種⼼ (yu shan zhi shi qi shi zhong xin), which can
mean “he developed ten aspirations in the presence of the kalyāṇamitra,”
i.e., the night goddess Sarva jagad rakṣā praṇidhāna vīrya prabhā. Here ⼼ (xin,
“mind”) can be understood as “aspiration.”
According to the Tibetan, presumably translating from samanta bhadra cārya.

vehicle”). The Chinese has 普賢菩薩所有⾏ (pu xian pu sa suo you xing, “all the

According to the Tibetan chos, translating dharma. The Chinese has 法 (fa,
“dharma”). The Sanskrit has karma (“action,” “activity”).
According to the Sanskrit asaṃbheda, which means “separate,” “distinct.” The
Tibetan translates as tha mi dad pa (“not different,” “undifferentiated”), which
does not appear to be the intended meaning here. Translated in the Chinese
as 差別 (cha bie).
According to the Sanskrit. The Tibetan appears to have suffered a corruption
here, with “fearlessness,” which comes later in the list, being added here too,
and the absence of a verb for “the ways of the Dharma.” The Tibetan has,
“The commonality of Dharma practice for the ocean of all the ways of the
Dharma; the commonality of fearlessness for the destruction of the mountain
of all obscurations.” The Chinese has “the commonality of ‘vigor, prowess’
同勇猛 (tong yong meng), which can destroy the mountain of all obstacles.”
According to the Sanskrit vacana. “Speech” is not present in the Tibetan. The
Chinese has 愛語 (ai yu, “loving words”), which means kind speech that

According to the Sanskrit locative plural case. The Tibetan translates as
instrumental. The Chinese appears to have rearranged the order of key
words and translates as 隨樂 (sui le, “the commonality of”), “following the
wishes [of beings] in manifesting objects according to the perception of
beings.”
According to the Sanskrit, though adhiṣṭhāna can mean “residence” or
“abode,” which appears to be the intended meaning here rather than
“empowerment” or “blessing.” The Tibetan has an omission of the middle of
the clause, probably missing from the Sanskrit manuscript, resulting in
simply “The commonality of the empowerment of all the tathāgatas.” The
Chinese translates as 護念 (hu nian, “blessed,” “protected”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has las in error for la
sa.
According to the Sanskrit and the Chinese. The Tibetan has kyis in error for
kyi sa.
According to the Tibetan mi mnyam. The Sanskrit has dyuitmāna (“shining,”
“majestic”). The Chinese translates as “I have attained ‘the fruit of
enlightenment.’ ”
According to the Sanskrit akṣaya and the Chinese 無盡 (wu jin). The Tibetan
has the meaningless mi bas, presumably in error for mi zad.
According to the Sanskrit hitāya and the Chinese 饒益 (rao yi). The Tibetan has
sman (“medicine”) in error for phan (“benefit”).

compound: “pariśuddhi vara pravarottama.” This presumably inadvertently omits
varṇā. The Chinese has 最勝廣⼤ (zui sheng guang da, “supreme and vast”).

(“way”). The Chinese has ⼀切眾⽣⾒不虛⾊⾝ (yi qie zhong sheng jian bu xu se
shen), the meaning of which is unclear.

others have dbyangs (“voice”). Not present in the Sanskrit. The Chinese has

upon.” The Chinese has 無決定無究竟 (wu jue ding wu jiu jing, “not
stable/unchanging, not ultimate”).
The Degé reprint has an incorrect page for folio 187.b. The page order has
been emended in the Degé reader.
According to the Sanskrit dharmatā and the Chinese 法性 (fa xing). The
Tibetan has just chos (“phenomena”) instead of chos nyid.
According to the Sanskrit plural accusative. The Tibetan has “through roots
of merit” or in Yongle “of roots of merit.”
According to the Sanskrit, the Chinese, and the Narthang med pa, which is
absent in the Degé but occurs when this topic is soon repeated. The BHS
kalpa, vikalpa, and parikalpa were translated into Tibetan as rtog pa, rnam par
rtog pa, and yongs su rtogs pa. However, the third of these is missing at this
point in the text but occurs when this subject is repeated. The Chinese has 遠
離⼀切分別境界 (yuan li yi qie fen bie jing jie, “free from all states of
differentiation”).
According to the Sanskrit and the Narthang and Lhasa med, which is absent
in Degé in this sentence but is preserved in the following sentence.

In the Sanskrit it is stated that he taught “for a thousand years.” The Chinese
is “for one hundred years.”

According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “all beings.” This phrase is absent
in the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit gupta and according to the Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi,
Narthang, and Choné pa. Degé has par. The Chinese separates the
descriptions of the senses and the mind: 寂定 (ji ding, “all senses are
pacified”). This literally means “peaceful and still,” so the translation would
read “like a tamed elephant, the mind…”
In accordance with the Sanskrit and the Tibetan translation earlier in the
chapter. This time the bodhisattva liberation includes the additional phrase

treasures”).

According to the Sanskrit yathāvādītathākārī (“to practice what one preaches”).
The Tibetan may have been translating from a corrupt manuscript, as it has,
literally, “to wash the body below the mouth.” The Chinese is similar to the
Sanskrit: 如說⾏ (ru shuo xing).

body.” The Chinese has 不誑 (bu kuang, “not deceive”).

From the BHS samanvāhṛta, which is translated into Chinese as 護念 (hu nian,

interpret this as “is focused on by all the tathāgatas.”
In accordance with the Tibetan, presumably translating from sarvajñā. The

shore.”

has 住無量處通達無礙 (zhu wu liang chu tong da wu ai, “dwell in countless
places and reach anywhere without obstruction”).
In accordance with the Tibetan. In the Sanskrit this sentence is conjoined
with the following sentence, with the verb “teach” therefore occurring only
once. The Chinese has “They manifest buddhahood to beings.”
Edgerton discusses this verse, the verb praṇidhyeti, and a possible error in the
Sanskrit. See his Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary, p. 360. The Chinese omits
numbering in all ten verses, and the third line in the first verse states “who
wish to make offerings all the time in the future.”

has sarva (“all”) in reference to the realms. The Chinese has “beings and
buddhas.”

According to the Sanskrit nadī and the Chinese 河 (he). Not present in the
Tibetan.
According to the Sanskrit. The last two items appear to have suffered an
omission and been merged in the Tibetan to “adornment of jewels.”
According to the Sanskrit garbha. The Tibetan has chu ba (“joint” or “root”).
The Chinese has ⾦剛為莖 (jin gang wei jing, “its stalk made of vajra”).
At this point there is an apparently unintelligible sentence in the Tibetan,
with no parallel in the Chinese or Sanskrit, that appears to have been subject
to scribal corruption. Literally it states, “It had the inner levels of an ocean of
beings, kings of jewels.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “It had the display of light rays
from the filaments made of all kings of jewels.” Perhaps the Tibetan was
translated from a text that had kesaraśikhara (“tip”) instead of kesararaśmi
(“rays”). The Chinese has 花鬚 (hua xu), presumably translating from kesara.
According to the Tibetan mdzes pa. Not present in the Chinese, which may
have been translating from a text that had cāru instead of rāja (“king”).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit has “wish-fulfilling kings of jewels.”
According to the Sanskrit devendra and the Chinese ⼀切天王 (yi qie tian wang),
and in conformity with the following list of lords of various deities. The
Tibetan has lha ris (“classes of deities”).

has spyangs in error for phyang.
The Tibetan may have suffered an omission. The Sanskrit has “All the lords
of garuḍas hung precious clouds of precious cloths that adorned the sky as
an awning over the crowd of bodhisattvas.” The Chinese has 繒幡 (zeng fan,
“silk banners,” “flags”) from patākā or ketu, without mentioning the clouds.
According to the Sanskrit janma, the Chinese 初⽣ (chu sheng), and its Tibetan
translation elsewhere in this passage. In this sentence the Tibetan translates
as tshe (“life”).

According to the commentary, this refers to the eightfold path, with wisdom
being the right view and conduct being the other seven aspects of the path.
The Chinese has ⼗號具⾜ (shi hao ju zu, “with the ten synonyms of the
tathāgata”).
Literally, “goddess.” Devī and deva were honorific terms for kings and
queens in India.
The Sanskrit and the Chinese translate as “buddhas.”
The name differs in the prose (mnyam par gzhag pa) and verse (snga phyi
mnyam) in the Tibetan. In the Sanskrit the prose has samāpadyata, while in the
Sanskrit verse there is the phrase kalpa ādiriva ananta nāyako (literally, “a kalpa
like the first, endless, guide,” which is ambiguous). However, the Sanskrit
that the Tibetan translated from was different, with the Tibetan meaning
“The name of the kalpa was Sameness of Beginning and End.” The Tibetan
appears to have translated from a manuscript that may have had kalpa ādiriva
anta nāmako. Cleary does not give a name but simply “age.” Carré, translating
from the Chinese 悅樂 (yue le), has the kalpa’s name as Plaisirs de la Joie (“The
Pleasures of Joy”). Because of this uncertainty we have repeated the name as
given in the prose.

In accordance with the Yongle, Lithang, and Choné. Degé has here the
particle la (“in”). The Chinese has 聖智⾝ (sheng zhi shen), which can be
understood to mean “the body of āryajñāna.”
According to the Sanskrit mantra and Cleary. Not present in the Tibetan,
Carré, or the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit animiṣa, which can mean “unblinking.” The two variant
spellings in Tibetan are blan pa myed pa and glan pa myed pa, which both mean
“not covered,” presumably referring to the eyes not being covered by the
eyelids. The Chinese has two phrases: “mind/intentions without any
momentary indolence” and “all actions are pure.”
From the Tibetan nyam nga ba, translating presumably from viṣama. The
present Sanskrit has viśaya (“range,” “field,” “scope”). The Chinese is the
same as the Tibetan.
From the Sanskrit śītibhāva. The Tibetan translates according to its other
meaning of “coolness” (bsil ba), which is also a part of the metaphor of
shelter from heat. The Chinese also translates this as 清涼 (qing liang,
“coolness”). Instead of “shelters,” it has 究竟 (jiu jing, “the ultimate,” “the
utmost”) without reference to a physical presentation.
“Of the Dharma” is according to the Tibetan. It is not found in the present
Sanskrit.
Literally, many “ten millions.” The Chinese reads 無量億千 (wu liang yi qian,
“innumerous thousands of yi”).
According to the Tibetan sems can thams cad, translating from sarvasattvān. The

with the Tibetan.

bzad pa (“endure” or “be exhausted”). Lithang, Kangxi, and Choné have bzod

The Sanskrit has “that ripens the bodhisattvas.” The Chinese has “that
ripens all beings.”
According to the Sanskrit vikurvita. The Tibetan has rnam par rtse ba (“play”),
presumably translating from vikrīḍita. The Chinese has 神通 (shen tong), which
could have been translated from either vikurvita or vikrīḍita.
According to the Yongle, Lithang, Kangxi, Lhasa, and Choné rnam par spyod
pa. Degé has dam par spyod pa. The Tibetan appears to have been translating
vicāra. The present Sanskrit has vihāra, usually translated into Tibetan as gnas
pa. The Chinese appears to be a translation of vihāra as 所住⽅便 (suo zhu fang
bian).
The Sanskrit has “in every direction.” The Chinese has “the ten directions.”
According to the Tibetan rta babs (Degé has rta bgab), normally used as a
translation of toraṇa, which can also mean “gateway” and “portico.”
However, the present Sanskrit has the obscure khāraka. Edgerton (p. 205)
speculates that it might mean a large number, having only found the word in
this very passage. Pali often shines a light on the meaning of BHS words, but
in Pali, khāraka is an adjective meaning “sharp” or “dry.” “Rivers,”
“vortexes,” “trees,” and “portals” are not present in the Chinese.
From the Sanskrit ākramaṇa and the Yongle, Kangxi, and Narthang gnan.
Degé has gnas (“dwell”). Not present in the Chinese.
The Sanskrit also has koṭi, which would make the number “eight hundred
and forty billion.” The Chinese translates as “It was the most important or
excellent among the eighty royal cities.”
The Sanskrit has “clouds of nets” with no reference to gold. This segment
describing the royal city and surrounding towns is not present in the
Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit aṣṭapada, which apparently has the meaning of
“eight sections” (vertical and horizontal), like a checkerboard or chessboard,
referring to a game that originated in its earliest form in the first centuries of
the first millennium in India, where board games were very popular.
Therefore, this appears to be a specific reference to the eight-by-eight-square
game board, and it has been translated in The Lotus Sūtra by Tsugunari and
Akira as “like a chessboard,” or by Kern as “like a checkerboard.” Other
English translations of the Chinese have interpreted this as “eight
intersecting roads.” In the translation of this sūtra Cleary has “jeweled
checkerboards.” This passage is absent in Carré.

pus of an abscess. The Tibetan has thogs pa (“obstruction,” “impediment”).
Narthang has ma thogs pa (“unimpeded”).
According to the Tibetan gseb ’gang ba. The BHS paryavanāha can mean
“covered over.” Edgerton (p. 334) discusses the possible meanings. This is
followed in the Sanskrit by atisarjana, which may mean the loss of a tooth.
Edgerton, finding the meaning obscure (p. 10), believes it is the same as
abhiṣajjana (p. 57), perhaps meaning the teeth get stuck together. There is no
translation for this term in the Tibetan.
The Sanskrit nīla is literally “blue,” but in Sanskrit literature it is used as a
euphemism for “black.” The Tibetan translates here nonliterally as nag
(“black”). The Sanskrit has abhinīla (“deep black”), and the Tibetan translates
this as dkar nag (“white and black”).

occur in the dbu med script.

yu ru lai zang, “grow from tathāgata garbha”).
In the online version of the Sanskrit (Vaidya) this verse is also given the
number 96, and therefore from this point on the numbers do not match. The
Chinese does not number the verses.
According to the Sanskrit tṛṣṇa and the Chinese 愛欲 (ai yu). The Tibetan has
srid pa in error for sred pa. Verses 101 and 102 are condensed into one with

point, but the Sanskrit continues to refer to Sudhana in the third person in
this and the following verse, only then switching to second person.

(“blister,”), which is one of the numerous diverse meanings of the Sanskrit,
Pali, and therefore, presumably, also BHS. It is not present in the Chinese.

point douter de lui (“have no doubt in him”). Cleary has “one will be serving
the Friends thereby.” The Chinese has 疑惑 (yi huo, “doubts”).
From this point on, the Chinese appears to be in prose, while the Sanskrit
and the Tibetan present the same matter in eight verses before turning to
prose.
According to the Tibetan ’jam dpal. The present Sanskrit uses his alternate
name Mañjughoṣa (normally translated into Tibetan as ’jam dbyangs).
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit omits “of all the lords of the world.”
According to the Tibetan, “ocean” presumably translating from a manuscript

as the Sanskrit in “May I not be cut off.”
According to the Tibetan. The Sanskrit and the Chinese do not have “and
beings.”

existences”). Here the translation follows Narthang and Urga, which have
tho rangs. The Chinese translates as 更漏⿎ (gen lou gu, “water clock drum”),
with the drum being part of a traditional clock, beaten three times at dawn or
when the night ends.
From the Sanskrit jihmīkaraṇa, translated into Chinese as 映奪 (ying duo). The
Tibetan translates as zil du brlag, where brlag does not in this case mean
“destroy.”

has “noncomposite and composite,” which is evidently an error.
According to the Tibetan dbyig. The Sanskrit has citta (“mind,” “motivation”).
Cleary has “motivation.” Carré has joyau extraordinaire (“extraordinary
jewel”), which is a possible translation of dbyig. The Chinese has 妙寶 (miao

aspirations or desires”).

translating from prabhāṣa, which can have a similar meaning, though the

but here the meaning is not “purify.” The Chinese has 清淨 (qing jing,
“purify”).
According to the Tibetan, which may have omitted the beginning of this
clause and the end of the previous clause, combining the two clauses in the
single clause: “he will increase all your roots of merit” instead of “he is the
one who has given birth to you into the family of the tathāgatas; he is the

According to the Sanskrit darśaka. The Tibetan has rab tu sgrub pa
(“accomplish”). The Chinese has 發起 (fa qi, “to begin”).

instead of the preceding ones. The Chinese has “to encounter true
kalyāṇamitra,” grouping this and the preceding three clauses together.
This paragraph is according to the Tibetan, which diverges from the Sanskrit
in terms of possible omission, changes of case, and the grouping of words.
From the Sanskrit vihārī and the Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Lhasa, and Stok
Palace spyod. Degé has dpyod (“analyze”). Translated as 安住 (an zhu), “abide.”

definitive views of all buddhas”).

“immeasurable”).

(“dedication to emanation activity”). Cleary has “representations of phantom
bodies of all beings.” Carré has permirent à tous les êtres de sortir du cercle
(“enable all beings to leave saṃsāra”). The Chinese has 令⼀切眾⽣皆得出離

term “saṃsāra” is omitted but implied, and the order of the ninth and the
tenth events are reversed.
According to the Tibetan kun tu lta ba. The Sanskrit has samanta bhadra cakṣur
(“eyes of Samanta bhadra”). Cleary has “eye of universal good.” Carré has œil
universel (“universal eyes”), appearing to base his translation on 普眼 (pu yan,
“all-seeing eyes”).

translated as smon pa, and as 願 (yuan) in the Chinese.
According to the Sanskrit viharenạ and the Yongle, Kangxi, Narthang, Lhasa,

⼤乘 (da sheng, “Mahāyāna”).

in.” The Chinese has 甚深⼊ (shen shen ru, “enter deeply into”).

According to the Sanskrit that uses yathā and tathā in this sentence. The
Tibetan could be interpreted to make this refer to one’s training being the
same as both of them, which is anyway the meaning of the verse, but it lacks
the statement that Samanta bhadra is equal in wisdom to Mañjuśrī.
The name as given at this point in the Sanskrit is Samantata bhadra.
Narthang, Lhasa, and Stok Palace have “It was translated and revised by the
chief editor Lotsawa Vairocana rakṣita.” Ngorchen Könchok Lhundrup
ascribes the translation of the sūtra to Vairocana rakṣita. Urga agrees with
Degé.
This accords with the classification by Ngorchen Könchok Lhundrup in his
sixteenth-century History of Buddhism.
Chapters 1 to 27. According to Pekar Zangpo in his sixteenth-century
Presentation of the Sūtras, this first section is divided into two sections: The
Tathāgata Earring Sūtra (as a translation of Tathāgatāvataṃsaka-sūtra), which
comprises chapters 1 to 11, and The Bodhisattva piṭaka Sūtra (consisting of
chapters 12 to 27), so that in his classification the Avataṃsaka Sūtra has eight
sections.
Chapters 28 to 30 according to Pekar Zangpo.
Chapter 31 according to Pekar Zangpo.
Chapters 32 to 42 according to Pekar Zangpo.
Chapter 43 according to Pekar Zangpo.
Chapter 44 according to Pekar Zangpo.

here.

fascicles and verses as quoted by Butön Rinpoché.

1598–1646). He was the tusi or ruler in the “native chieftain system” of the
Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.
bkod pa is the usual translation of vyūha (“array,” “display,” etc.) as in the
Mahāvyutpatti. This translation at times uses rgyan, which is usually a
translation for alaṃkara, and so on, with the meaning of “adornment.”
The usual translation for prasara (“vast extent,” etc.), as in the Mahāvyutpatti,
is rab ’byams, while ’byam klas does not appear in that dictionary.
These are both translations of pratisaṃvit (“discern,” “distinguish,” etc.).
thugs normally translates citta (“mind”), while dgongs pa translates abhiprāya
(“intention,” “outlook,” “regard,” etc.).
This phrase, meaning “for a day and night,” or “for a waxing phase and a
waning phase of a month,” occurs on folio 26.b within The Inconceivable
Qualities of the Buddha (sang rgyas chos bsam mi khyab), which is the 39th chapter
of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra.
tha snyad usually translates vyavahāra, which in BHS means “a term or
designation,” while rnam par dpyod pa usually translates vicāraṇa, etc.
(“contemplation,” “analysis,” and so on).
This is before the eighth Tai Situpa Chökyi Jungné (1700–1774) began his
work on editing the Kangyur in 1729.

Avalokiteśvara

avalokiteśvara
First appeared as a bodhisattva beside Amitābha in the Sukhāvatī vyūha Sūtra
(The Display of the Pure Land of Sukhāvatī, Toh 115). The name has been
variously interpreted. In its meaning as “the lord of avalokita,” avalokita has
been interpreted as “seeing,” although, as a past passive participle, it is
literally “lord of what has been seen.” One of the principal sūtras in the
Mahāsāṃghika tradition was the Avalokita Sūtra, which has not been
translated into Tibetan, in which the word is a synonym for enlightenment,
as it is “that which has been seen” by the buddhas. In the early tantras, he
was one of the lords of the three families, as the embodiment of the
compassion of the Buddhas. The Potalaka Mountain in South India became
important in Southern Indian Buddhism as his residence in this world, but
Potalaka does not feature in the Kāraṇḍa vyūha Sūtra (The Basket’s Display, Toh
116), which is the most important sūtra dedicated to Avalokiteśvara.

bhikṣu
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:


---

The term bhikṣu, often translated as “monk,” refers to the highest among the
eight types of prātimokṣa vows that make one part of the Buddhist assembly.
The Sanskrit term literally means “beggar” or “mendicant,” referring to the
fact that Buddhist monks and nuns —like other ascetics of the time —
subsisted on alms (bhikṣā) begged from the laity.
In the Tibetan tradition, which follows the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, a monk
follows 253 rules as part of his moral discipline. A nun (bhikṣuṇī; dge slong ma)
follows 364 rules. A novice monk (śrāmaṇera; dge tshul) or nun (śrāmaṇerikā; dge
tshul ma) follows thirty-six rules of moral discipline (although in other vinaya
traditions novices typically follow only ten).

Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
The term bhikṣuṇī, often translated as “nun,” refers to the highest among the
eight types of prātimokṣa vows that make one part of the Buddhist assembly.
The Sanskrit term bhikṣu (to which the female grammatical ending ṇī is
added) literally means “beggar” or “mendicant,” referring to the fact that
Buddhist nuns and monks —like other ascetics of the time —subsisted on
alms (bhikṣā) begged from the laity. In the Tibetan tradition, which follows
the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya, a bhikṣuṇī follows 364 rules and a bhikṣu
follows 253 rules as part of their moral discipline.
For the first few years of the Buddha’s teachings in India, there was no
ordination for women. It started at the persistent request and display of
determination of Mahāprajāpatī, the Buddha’s stepmother and aunt,
together with five hundred former wives of men of Kapilavastu, who had
themselves become monks. Mahāprajāpatī is thus considered to be the
founder of the nun’s order.

This is literally the “ground” in which qualities grow like plants, and it also

to levels of enlightenment, especially the seven or ten levels of the
enlightened bodhisattvas. Sūtras such as the Perfection of Wisdom sūtras teach
the seven bhūmis. The teaching of ten bhūmis was found in the
Mahāsāṃghika tradition and particularly in the Daśa bhūmika Sūtra (Toh 44,
ch. 31, Ten Bhūmi Sūtra), which is the thirty-first chapter in the Tibetan
version of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra.

This term in its broadest sense can refer to any being, whether human,

nonhuman beings, especially when bhūtas are mentioned alongside
rākṣasas, piśācas, or pretas. In common with these other kinds of

nonhumans, bhūtas are usually depicted with unattractive and misshapen
bodies. Like several other classes of nonhuman beings, bhūtas take
spontaneous birth. As their leader is traditionally regarded to be Rudra-Śiva
(also known by the name Bhūta), with whom they haunt dangerous and wild
places, bhūtas are especially prominent in Śaivism, where large sections of
certain tantras concentrate on them.

also equivalent to the Vaḍaba submarine mountain of fire, which is also said
to be the entrance to the hells. The term cakravāla is also used to mean “the

entire disk of a world,” including Meru and the paradises above it. More
commonly, as in this sūtra, it is the name of the outer ring of mountains at
the edge of the flat disk of a world, with Sumeru in the center. Yet it is has
the nature of heat, like the Mountain Vaḍaba, in that the heat of the ring of
mountains evaporates the ocean so that it does not overflow. Also called

cakravartin
’khor los sgyur ba

cakravartin
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
An ideal monarch or emperor who, as the result of the merit accumulated in
previous lifetimes, rules over a vast realm in accordance with the Dharma.
Such a monarch is called a cakravartin because he bears a wheel (cakra) that
rolls (vartate) across the earth, bringing all lands and kingdoms under his
power. The cakravartin conquers his territory without causing harm, and his
activity causes beings to enter the path of wholesome actions. According to
Vasubandhu’s Abhidharmakośa, just as with the buddhas, only one
cakravartin appears in a world system at any given time. They are likewise
endowed with the thirty-two major marks of a great being
(mahāpuruṣalakṣaṇa), but a cakravartin’s marks are outshined by those of a
buddha. They possess seven precious objects: the wheel, the elephant, the
horse, the wish-fulfilling gem, the queen, the general, and the minister. An
illustrative passage about the cakravartin and his possessions can be found
in The Play in Full (Toh 95), 3.3–3.13.
Vasubandhu lists four types of cakravartins: (1) the cakravartin with a
golden wheel (suvarṇacakravartin) rules over four continents and is invited by
lesser kings to be their ruler; (2) the cakravartin with a silver wheel
(rūpyacakravartin) rules over three continents and his opponents submit to
him as he approaches; (3) the cakravartin with a copper wheel
(tāmracakravartin) rules over two continents and his opponents submit
themselves after preparing for battle; and (4) the cakravartin with an iron
wheel (ayaścakravartin) rules over one continent and his opponents submit
themselves after brandishing weapons.

distinctive appearance of a band of light, resembling a cat’s eye. It has been

likely means “banner of light.” However, the Tibetan translates the term as
“banner of stars.”

pratītya samutpāda
The teaching that everything arises in dependence on something else, which
is also applied to the entire process of life and death. This became
standardized into twelve sequences of dependent origination, beginning
with ignorance, followed by formation, and concluding in death. In the Pali
suttas, this was more often taught as a greater number of successive
sequences, commencing with ignorance and formation being simultaneous
and codependent, like two sticks leaning against each other.

deva
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:


---

In the most general sense the devas —the term is cognate with the English
divine —are a class of celestial beings who frequently appear in Buddhist
texts, often at the head of the assemblies of nonhuman beings who attend
and celebrate the teachings of the Buddha Śākyamuni and other buddhas
and bodhisattvas. In Buddhist cosmology the devas occupy the highest of
the five or six “destinies” (gati) of saṃsāra among which beings take rebirth.
The devas reside in the devalokas, “heavens” that traditionally number
between twenty-six and twenty-eight and are divided between the desire
realm (kāmadhātu), form realm (rūpadhātu), and formless realm (ārūpyadhātu). A
being attains rebirth among the devas either through meritorious deeds (in
the desire realm) or the attainment of subtle meditative states (in the form
and formless realms). While rebirth among the devas is considered favorable,
it is ultimately a transitory state from which beings will fall when the
conditions that lead to rebirth there are exhausted. Thus, rebirth in the god
realms is regarded as a diversion from the spiritual path.

that ruled South India from the first to third century ᴄᴇ. Known primarily as
Dhānyakaṭaka, the present remains are in the village of Dharaṇikoṭa, a few

palas or forty karṣa, and roughly equivalent to 350 grams, or near to a pound.
The Tibetan translates both pala and dharaṇa as srang in this sūtra. Pala is said
to be srang in the Mahāvyutpatti, but that dictionary has no equivalent for
dharaṇa.

Distinct from the rūpakāya or “form body” of a buddha. In origin it was a term
for the presence of the Dharma, which would continue after the Buddha’s
passing. It also came to refer to someone who was an embodiment of the
Dharma, and also the eternal, imperceptible realization of a buddha, and

therefore became synonymous with the true nature. In the context of the
teaching of the three kāyas of a buddha, only the term dharmakāya (chos kyi
sku), rather than dharmaśarīra, (chos kyi lus) was used.

Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
A class of generally benevolent nonhuman beings who inhabit the skies,
sometimes said to inhabit fantastic cities in the clouds, and more specifically
to dwell on the eastern slopes of Mount Meru, where they are ruled by the
Great King Dhṛtarāṣṭra. They are most renowned as celestial musicians who
serve the gods. In the Abhidharma, the term is also used to refer to the
mental body assumed by sentient beings during the intermediate state
between death and rebirth. Gandharvas are said to live on fragrances
(gandha) in the desire realm, hence the Tibetan translation dri za, meaning
“scent eater.”

gaṅgā
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
The Gaṅgā, or Ganges in English, is considered to be the most sacred river
of India, particularly within the Hindu tradition. It starts in the Himalayas,
flows through the northern plains of India, bathing the holy city of Vārāṇasī,
and meets the sea at the Bay of Bengal, in Bangladesh. In the sūtras,
however, this river is mostly mentioned not for its sacredness but for its
abundant sands —noticeable still today on its many sandy banks and at its
delta —which serve as a common metaphor for infinitely large numbers.
According to Buddhist cosmology, as explained in the Abhidharmakośa, it is
one of the four rivers that flow from Lake Anavatapta and cross the southern
continent of Jambudvīpa —the known human world or more specifically the
Indian subcontinent.

aparamāṇa
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
The four meditations on love (maitrī), compassion (karuṇā), joy (muditā), and
equanimity (upekṣā), as well as the states of mind and qualities of being that
result from their cultivation. They are also called the four abodes of Brahmā
(caturbrahmavihāra).
In the Abhidharmakośa, Vasubandhu explains that they are called apramāṇa —
meaning “infinite” or “limitless” —because they take limitless sentient
beings as their object, and they generate limitless merit and results. Love is
described as the wish that beings be happy, and it acts as an antidote to
malice (vyāpāda). Compassion is described as the wish for beings to be free of
suffering, and acts as an antidote to harmfulness (vihiṃsā). Joy refers to
rejoicing in the happiness beings already have, and it acts as an antidote to
dislike or aversion (arati) toward others’ success. Equanimity is considering
all beings impartially, without distinctions, and it is the antidote to
attachment to both pleasure and malice (kāmarāgavyāpāda).

Jambudvīpa
’dzam bu gling

jambudvīpa
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
The name of the southern continent in Buddhist cosmology, which can
signify either the known human world, or more specifically the Indian
subcontinent, literally “the jambu island/continent.” Jambu is the name used
for a range of plum-like fruits from trees belonging to the genus Szygium,
particularly Szygium jambos and Szygium cumini, and it has commonly been
rendered “rose apple,” although “black plum” may be a less misleading
term. Among various explanations given for the continent being so named,
one (in the Abhidharmakośa) is that a jambu tree grows in its northern
mountains beside Lake Anavatapta, mythically considered the source of the
four great rivers of India, and that the continent is therefore named from the
tree or the fruit. Jambudvīpa has the Vajrāsana at its center and is the only
continent upon which buddhas attain awakening.

jetavanam anāthapiṇḍadasyārāmaḥ 
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
One of the first Buddhist monasteries, located in a park outside Śrāvastī, the
capital of the ancient kingdom of Kośala in northern India. This park was
originally owned by Prince Jeta, hence the name Jetavana, meaning Jeta’s
grove. The wealthy merchant Anāthapiṇḍada, wishing to offer it to the
Buddha, sought to buy it from him, but the prince, not wishing to sell, said
he would only do so if Anāthapiṇḍada covered the entire property with gold
coins. Anāthapiṇḍada agreed, and managed to cover all of the park except
the entrance, hence the name Anāthapiṇḍadasyārāmaḥ, meaning
Anāthapiṇḍada’s park. The place is usually referred to in the sūtras as
“Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍada’s park,” and according to the Saṃghabhedavastu
the Buddha used Prince Jeta’s name in first place because that was Prince
Jeta’s own unspoken wish while Anāthapiṇḍada was offering the park.
Inspired by the occasion and the Buddha’s use of his name, Prince Jeta then
offered the rest of the property and had an entrance gate built. The Buddha
specifically instructed those who recite the sūtras to use Prince Jeta’s name
in first place to commemorate the mutual effort of both benefactors.

Anāthapiṇḍada built residences for the monks, to house them during the
monsoon season, thus creating the first Buddhist monastery. It was one of
the Buddha’s main residences, where he spent around nineteen rainy season
retreats, and it was therefore the setting for many of the Buddha’s discourses
and events. According to the travel accounts of Chinese monks, it was still in
use as a Buddhist monastery in the early fifth century ᴄᴇ, but by the sixth
century it had been reduced to ruins.

Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:

very name —which means “is that human?” —suggests some confusion as to

human, half animal. They are often depicted as highly skilled celestial
musicians.
g. 620
kleśa
nyon mongs
ན་ངས།
kleśa
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
The essentially pure nature of mind is obscured and afflicted by various
psychological defilements, which destroy the mind’s peace and composure
and lead to unwholesome deeds of body, speech, and mind, acting as causes
for continued existence in saṃsāra. Included among them are the primary
afflictions of desire (rāga), anger (dveṣa), and ignorance (avidyā). It is said that
there are eighty-four thousand of these negative mental qualities, for which
the eighty-four thousand categories of the Buddha’s teachings serve as the
antidote.
Kleśa is also commonly translated as “negative emotions,” “disturbing
emotions,” and so on. The Pāli kilesa, Middle Indic kileśa, and Buddhist
Hybrid Sanskrit kleśa all primarily mean “stain” or “defilement.” The
translation “affliction” is a secondary development that derives from the
more general (non-Buddhist) classical understanding of √kliś (“to harm,“ “to
afflict”). Both meanings are noted by Buddhist commentators.

krakucchanda
The first of the buddhas in this kalpa, with Śākyamuni as the fourth. Also

The Tibetan translation in this sūtra and in others, such as the Kāraṇḍa vyūha
Sūtra (The Basket’s Display, Toh 116), means “elimination of incorrect faith.”
This version is also found in the Mahāvyutpatti, whereas the later standard


---

Tibetan translation is ’khor ba ’jig (“destruction of saṃsāra”). Krakucchanda is a
Sanskritization of the Middle-Indic name Kakusaṃdha. Kaku may mean
“summit,” and saṃdha is “inner meaning” or “hidden meaning.”

māra
The deities ruled over by Māra, who attempted to prevent the Buddha’s
enlightenment; they do not wish any being to escape from saṃsāra. Also,
they are symbolic of the defects within a person that prevents
enlightenment. These four personifications are devaputra māra (lha’i bu’i bdud)
the “divine māra,” which is the distraction of pleasures; mṛtyumāra (’chi bdag
gi bdud) the “māra of death”; skandhamāra (phung po’i bdud) the “māra of the
aggregates,” which is the body; and kleśamāra (nyon mongs pa’i bdud) the
“māra of the kleśas.”

The deity that attempted to prevent the Buddha’s enlightenment, also one of

to escape from that realm. He is also symbolic of the defects within a person
that prevent enlightenment.

There are ten of these meditative states in the Śrāvakayāna: through
meditating individually on the four elements of earth, water, fire, and air, on
the four colors blue, yellow, red, and white, on space, and on consciousness,
one meditates that everything that exists becomes that element, or that color,
or space, or consciousness. Elsewhere, including the Mahāvyutpatti, this is
translated as zad par gyi skye mched. The Sanskrit kṛtsna means “totality,” while
rgyas pa means “spread,” or “pervade,” and zad par means cessation, in that
everything ceases within that element, color, etc.

than the pure realm of Sukhāvatī. However, in this sūtra the verse appears to

pratyeka buddha
rang sangs rgyas
རང་སངས་ས།
pratyeka buddha  · pratyekajina  · pratyekasaṃbuddha
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
Literally, “buddha for oneself” or “solitary realizer.” Someone who, in his or
her last life, attains awakening entirely through their own contemplation,
without relying on a teacher. Unlike the awakening of a fully realized
buddha (samyaksambuddha), the accomplishment of a pratyeka buddha is not
regarded as final or ultimate. They attain realization of the nature of
dependent origination, the selflessness of the person, and a partial
realization of the selflessness of phenomena, by observing the suchness of
all that arises through interdependence. This is the result of progress in
previous lives but, unlike a buddha, they do not have the necessary merit,
compassion or motivation to teach others. They are named as “rhinoceros-
like” (khaḍgaviṣāṇakalpa) for their preference for staying in solitude or as
“congregators” (vargacārin) when their preference is to stay among peers.

Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:


---

One of the five or six classes of sentient beings, into which beings are born
as the karmic fruition of past miserliness. As the term in Sanskrit means “the
departed,” they are analogous to the ancestral spirits of Vedic tradition, the
pitṛs, who starve without the offerings of descendants. It is also commonly
translated as “hungry ghost” or “starving spirit,” as in the Chinese 餓⿁ e
gui.
They are sometimes said to reside in the realm of Yama, but are also
frequently described as roaming charnel grounds and other inhospitable or
frightening places along with piśācas and other such beings. They are
particularly known to suffer from great hunger and thirst and the inability to
acquire sustenance.

śakra
Also commonly known as Indra, he is the deity, called “lord of the devas,”
who dwells on the summit of Mount Sumeru and wields the thunderbolt.
The Tibetan translation is based on an etymology that śakra is an abbreviation
of śata-kratu: one who has performed a hundred sacrifices. The highest Vedic
sacrifice was the horse sacrifice, and there is a tradition that he became the
lord of the gods through performing them.

samādhi
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
In a general sense, samādhi can describe a number of different meditative
states. In the Mahāyāna literature, in particular in the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras,
we find extensive lists of different samādhis, numbering over one hundred.


---

In a more restricted sense, and when understood as a mental state, samādhi is
defined as the one-pointedness of the mind (cittaikāgratā), the ability to
remain on the same object over long periods of time. The Drajor Bamponyipa
(sgra sbyor bam po gnyis pa) commentary on the Mahāvyutpatti explains the
term samādhi as referring to the instrument through which mind and mental
states “get collected,” i.e., it is by the force of samādhi that the continuum of
mind and mental states becomes collected on a single point of reference
without getting distracted.

seven jewels
rin po che sna bdun
ན་་་་བན།
saptaratna
When associated with the seven heavenly bodies, and therefore the seven
days of the week, they are ruby for the sun, moonstone or pearl for the moon,
coral for Mars, emerald for Mercury, yellow sapphire for Jupiter, diamond for
Venus, and blue sapphire for Saturn. There are variant lists not associated
with the heavenly bodies but retaining the number seven, which include
gold, silver, and so on. In association with a cakravartin the seven jewels can
refer, according to the Abhidharma, to his magical wheel, elephant, horse,
wish-fulfilling jewel, queen, minister, and leading householder. In the
Tibetan maṇḍala offering practice, the householder is replaced by a general.
g. 1155

white coral.
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
The set of seven precious materials or substances includes a range of
precious metals and gems, but their exact list varies. The set often consists of
gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red pearls, emeralds, and white coral, but may also
contain lapis lazuli, ruby, sapphire, chrysoberyl, diamonds, etc. The term is
frequently used in the sūtras to exemplify preciousness, wealth, and beauty,
and can describe treasures, offering materials, or the features of architectural
structures such as stūpas, palaces, thrones, etc. The set is also used to
describe the beauty and prosperity of buddha realms and the realms of the
gods.
In other contexts, the term saptaratna can also refer to the seven precious
possessions of a cakravartin or to a set of seven precious moral qualities.

śrāvaka
nyan thos
ཉན་ས།
śrāvaka
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
The Sanskrit term śrāvaka, and the Tibetan nyan thos, both derived from the
verb “to hear,” are usually defined as “those who hear the teaching from the
Buddha and make it heard to others.” Primarily this refers to those disciples of
the Buddha who aspire to attain the state of an arhat seeking their own
liberation and nirvāṇa. They are the practitioners of the first turning of the
wheel of the Dharma on the four noble truths, who realize the suffering
inherent in saṃsāra and focus on understanding that there is no
independent self. By conquering afflicted mental states (kleśa), they liberate
themselves, attaining first the stage of stream enterers at the path of seeing,
followed by the stage of once-returners who will be reborn only one more
time, and then the stage of non-returners who will no longer be reborn into
the desire realm. The final goal is to become an arhat. These four stages are
also known as the “four results of spiritual practice.”

sugata
Definition from the 84000 Glossary of Terms:
One of the standard epithets of the buddhas. A recurrent explanation offers
three different meanings for su- that are meant to show the special qualities
of “accomplishment of one’s own purpose” (svārthasampad) for a complete
buddha. Thus, the Sugata is “well” gone, as in the expression su-rūpa
(“having a good form”); he is gone “in a way that he shall not come back,” as
in the expression su-naṣṭa-jvara (“a fever that has utterly gone”); and he has
gone “without any remainder” as in the expression su-pūrṇa-ghaṭa (“a pot
that is completely full”). According to Buddhaghoṣa, the term means that the
way the Buddha went (Skt. gata) is good (Skt. su) and where he went (Skt.
gata) is good (Skt. su).

་། · ་་།
varuṇa
The name of the deity of water, whose weapon is a noose. In the Vedas,
Varuṇa is an important deity and in particular the deity of the sky, but in
later Indian tradition he is the deity of the water and the underworld. The
Tibetan does not attempt to translate his name but instead has “god of
water.” The Sanskrit name has ancient pre-Sanskrit origins, and, as he was
originally the god of the sky, is related to the root vṛ, meaning “enveloping”
or “covering.” He has the same ancient origins as the ancient Greek sky
deity Uranus and the Zoroastrian supreme deity Mazda.

In early Buddhism the third of seven buddhas, with Śākyamuni as the
seventh. The first three buddhas —Vipaśyin, Śikhin, and Viśvabhuk —
appeared in a kalpa earlier than our Bhadra kalpa, and therefore Śākyamuni
is more commonly referred to as the fourth buddha.

In other translations, this is translated into Tibetan as spug. White coral is
fossilized coral that has undergone transformation under millions of years of
underwater pressure. The Tibetan tradition describes it being formed from
ice over a long period of time. It appears in one version of the list of the
seven precious materials. It can also refer to tridacna (Tridacnidae) shell, which
is also presently called musaragalva. Attempts to identify musalagalva have
included sapphire, cat’s eye, red coral, conch, and amber.

these are Indra (Śakra) for the east, Agni for the southeast, Yama for the
south, Sūrya or Nirṛti for the southwest, Varuṇa for the west, Vāyu (Pavana)
for the northwest, Kubera for the north, and Soma (Candra) or Iśāni or

gnod sbyin
གད་ན།
yakṣa
A class of supernatural beings, often represented as the attendants of the
god of wealth, although the term is also applied to spirits. Although they are
generally portrayed as benevolent, the Tibetan translation means “harm
giver,” as they are also capable of causing harm.

yāna

---

ག་པ།
yāna
A “way of going,” which primarily means a path or a way. It can also mean a
conveyance or carriage; this definition is represented in commentarial
literature by the Tibetan translation as “carrier,” and therefore it is also
translated into English as “vehicle.”

yellow sandalwood
dus dang mthun pa’i tsan dan
ས་དང་མན་པ་ཙན་དན།
kālānusāri candana
Sanskrit dictionaries also define the word as “gum benzoin” (not to be
confused with the unrelated chemical, benzoin) and the Shisham or Indian
Rosewood tree (Dalbergia sissoo). However, in this sūtra this is evidently
referring to a kind of sandalwood (Santalum album). The name, which means
“following time,” refers to the long-lasting scent of the wood. In other texts
kālānusāri candana is translated as dus kyi rjes su ’brang ba.
g. 1547

---

The longest unit of distance in classical India. The lack of a uniform standard
for the smaller units means that there is no precise equivalent, especially as
its theoretical length tended to increase over time. Therefore it can mean
between four and ten miles.
