Chapter 18
RATNACŪḌA
18. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, had conviction in that river of merit. He
viewed that field of merit. He purified that mountain
 of merit. He climbed
down that stairway to the bathing place of merit. He opened that treasury of
merit. He viewed that treasure of merit. He purified that domain of merit. He
carried away that heap of merit. He developed that strength of merit. He
increased that power of merit.

18. 2
Sudhana eventually arrived at the town of Siṃhapota. He searched for
Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant patron of the Dharma. He saw him in the
middle of a market.
 Sudhana bowed his head to Ratnacūḍa’s feet,
circumambulated Ratnacūḍa, keeping him to his right, many hundreds of
thousands of times, [F.16.b] and sat down before him. With his hands
together in homage, he said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas
should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
985
18. 3
“Ārya, will you not bestow on me the instruction for the bodhisattva path,
which is the path by which I will become omniscient?”
Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant patron of the Dharma, grasped the hands
of Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, led him to his home and, showing
Sudhana his home, said, “Noble one, look at my home!”
18. 4
Sudhana looked at it. The house was made of pure, bright Jambu River
gold. It was vast and tall and encircled by a wall of silver. It was beautified
by arrangements of bright crystals. It was adorned by a hundred thousand
clusters of beryls. There was an array of pillars of white coral. A lion throne
made of red pearls had been erected. Lion banners made of asteria jewels
were displayed. Overhead there was a shining canopy of jewels. It was
draped in nets of gold adorned with wish-fulfilling jewels. There was an
array of countless varieties of precious jewels. It was furnished with ponds

made of emerald and filled with cool water. It was encircled by trees made of
precious materials. It was massive. It was vast. It had ten stories. It was very
tall. It had eight doors.
18. 5
Sudhana went inside and looked around.
On the first floor he saw food and drink being distributed.
On the second floor he saw clothing being given away. [F.17.a]
18. 6
On the third floor he saw jewelry and adornments being given away.
On the fourth floor he saw being given away the most precious, excellent
maidens on the great earth who are the pleasures enjoyed in harems.
18. 7
On the fifth floor he saw an assembly of bodhisattvas on the fifth bhūmi
who were dedicated to the pleasure of talking together
 about the Dharma,
whose thoughts were concerned with the benefit and happiness of the
world, who were accomplished in all treatises, who had the power of
retention, who had the seal
 of samādhi, who rose from samādhi, who
analyzed samādhi, and who had attained the light of wisdom.
986
987
18. 8
On the sixth floor he saw bodhisattvas who had attained the state of the
perfection of wisdom, who had profound wisdom, who had clairvoyantly
perceived the pacification of all phenomena, who came forth from all the
gateways that were the essences and gateways of the samādhis and
retentions,
 whose range of activity was free of obscuration, who practiced
nonduality, who manifested discussions of the Dharma, and who followed
the way of the perfection of wisdom, analyzed it, elucidated it, and discussed
the many gateways to the perfection of wisdom. These included the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the essence of peace, the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the categories of wisdom for all beings, the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the unwavering turning, the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the dust-free light, the gateway to the perfection of
wisdom called the essence
 of invincibility, the gateway to the perfection of
wisdom called the illumination of beings,
 [F.17.b] the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the field of the way that is followed, the gateway to
the perfection of wisdom called the essence of the ocean,
 the gateway to the
perfection of wisdom called the attainment of all-seeing equanimity, the gateway
to the perfection of wisdom called the possession of inexhaustible treasure, the
gateway to the perfection of wisdom called the ocean of the ways of the Dharma,
the gateway to the perfection of wisdom called following the ocean of beings, the
gateway to the perfection of wisdom called unimpeded eloquence, and the
gateway to the perfection of wisdom called resting in objectlessness after
focusing on the clouds of the Dharma. They discussed the perfection of wisdom
through countless millions of such gateways to the perfection of wisdom in a
countless array of separate gatherings of assemblies of bodhisattvas.

18. 9
On the seventh floor he saw an assembly of bodhisattvas who had all
attained the patience of perceiving everything as echoes, who had given rise
to infallible wisdom and method, and who had received the clouds of the
Dharma from all tathāgatas.
18. 10
On the eighth floor he saw an assembly of bodhisattvas who had all
attained clairvoyance that would never diminish, who moved within all
world realms, whose images appeared within all the gathered assemblies,
whose bodies were distributed throughout the entire realm of phenomena,
whose field of experience never departed from being at the feet of all the
tathāgatas, who encountered the bodies of all the buddhas, and who were
the first individuals to speak within the assemblies of the followers of all the
tathāgatas. [F.18.a]
18. 11
On the ninth floor he saw an assembly of bodhisattvas who were all in
their final lifetime.
18. 12
On the tenth floor he saw when all the tathāgatas first developed the
aspiration for enlightenment, their conduct, their setting forth, their oceans
of prayers, the range of their buddha miracles, their buddha realms, all their
circles of followers, their teaching the wheel of the Dharma, and their power
to guide beings.
18. 13
When he had seen this, he asked Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant patron of
the Dharma, “Ārya, how did you gain this pure good fortune? How did you
plant the roots of merit that have ripened in this way?”992
18. 14
Ratnacūḍa answered, “Noble one, I remember that in the past, more
kalpas ago than there are atoms in a buddha realm, there was a world realm
called Cakravicitra, and in that world appeared a tathāgata, an arhat, a
samyak saṃbuddha, one with wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who
knows the world’s beings, an unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a
teacher of devas and humans, a buddha, a bhagavat named Ananta raśmi-
dharma dhātu samalaṃkṛta dharma rāja. That tathāgata, together with a billion
śrāvakas, such as Jñānavairocana, and a trillion bodhisattvas, such as Jñāna-
sūrya tejas, having been invited by King Dharmeśvara rāja, went to the great
park called Maṇi dhvaja vyūha rāja.
993
994
18. 15
“When the Tathāgata had entered the town [F.18.b] and was passing
through the market, in order to make an offering to the Tathāgata and his
saṅgha of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas, I played music and burned a pellet of
incense to spread the aroma. By burning that pellet of incense, the entirety of
Jambudvīpa was covered for seven days with multicolored clouds
 of
perfume that took on the forms of all beings.
995
18. 16
“From those clouds of perfume came these words: ‘The tathāgatas have an
inconceivable accumulation of the stainless knowledge of the three times.
That omniscience is free of all obscuration. They have eliminated all the


---

propensities for kleśas. All that is offered to the tathāgatas will bring the
immeasurable great result of omniscience. It will unite you with
omniscience.’
18. 17
“Those words were emitted from those masses of clouds of incense
through the blessing of the Buddha in order to ripen my roots of merit and
increase the power of the roots of merit of countless
 beings.
996
18. 18
“Noble one, I dedicated the roots of merit from the manifestation of that
miracle to three objectives through the blessing of the Tathāgata. What are
those three? I made the dedication so that I would have the complete vision
of all kalyāṇamitras, of all buddhas, and of all bodhisattvas.
18. 19
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the unimpeded
display of the field of prayer. [F.19.a] How could I know the conduct or describe
the qualities of the bodhisattvas who are the source of limitless good
qualities, who have entered an unalloyed ocean of buddha bodies, who have
received the rain from unalloyed Dharma clouds, who have entered an ocean
of unalloyed qualities, who have extended the net of completely good
conduct, who have entered the range of unalloyed samādhis, who have the
unalloyed continuous roots of merit of all bodhisattvas, who have the
unalloyed nonconceptual conduct of all the tathāgatas, who have entered
the unalloyed equality of the three times, who have the unalloyed ability to
dwell tirelessly in all kalpas, and who reside on the level of an unalloyed
complete range of vision?
18. 20
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a land called
Vetramūlaka. There, in a town called Samanta mukha, dwells a perfume-seller
head merchant by the name of Samanta netra. Go to him and ask him, ‘How
should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
18. 21
Sudhana bowed his head to the feet of Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant
patron of the Dharma, circumambulated Ratnacūḍa, the head-merchant
patron of the Dharma, many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to
his right, and, looking back again and again, departed from Ratnacūḍa, the
head-merchant patron of the Dharma. [B2]
