VASUMITRĀ
28. 1
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, with his mind illuminated by that great
light of wisdom, focusing upon the light of omniscience, regarding the light
of the power of the true nature, strengthening the way of retention that is
the treasure of what was known from the voices of all beings, increasing the
way of retention that possesses the Dharma wheels of all the tathāgatas,
supporting
 the power of the great compassion that is a refuge for all
beings, realizing the strength of the omniscience that comes from the
gateway of the light of the way of all Dharmas, following the pure aspiration
that pervades the domain of the vast realm of phenomena, shining with the
light of wisdom that illuminates all the directions of phenomena,
accomplishing the power of the higher knowledge that pervades the array of
world realms in the ten directions of all phenomena, and fulfilling the
aspirations of accomplishing undertaking all the practices, memories, and
actions
 of the bodhisattvas, eventually arrived at the city of Ratnavyūha
in the land of Durga and searched for the courtesan Vasumitrā.

28. 2
The people there who did not know the qualities of the courtesan
Vasumitrā [F.62.b] and lacked the knowledge of the scope of wisdom
thought, “What does such a man —who has pacified and controlled senses,
who is mindful, who is unconfused, whose mind is not agitated, who keeps
his gaze the length of a yoke before him, whose mind is not overcome by
sensations, who is not fixated on external features, whose eyes are
averted
 from dwelling on any physical form, whose mind is free of
preoccupations, who is wise,
 who is like an ocean, whose mind is
unshakable and without weakness —want with the courtesan Vasumitrā?
Someone like this does not delight in sensual pleasures, and so his mind
cannot possibly go astray. Someone like this does not engage in impure
thoughts. It is not possible that someone like this would be a slave to desire.
Someone like this does not fall under the power of a woman. It is not
1206

possible that someone like this is engaged in the field of conduct of the
māras. Someone like this does not dwell in the field of conduct of the māras.
It is not possible that someone like this is sinking into the mud of desire.
Someone like this is not bound by the noose of the māras. He is not someone
who would do what should not be done.”
28. 3
Those who did know the special qualities of the courtesan Vasumitrā and
directly perceived wisdom’s range of conduct said to him, “It is excellent,
excellent, noble one, that you intend to ask questions of the courtesan
Vasumitrā; you have perfectly obtained a good outcome. You are certainly
aspiring to buddhahood. You are certainly wishing to become a refuge
for all beings. You are certainly wishing to remove from all beings the pain of
desire. You are certainly wishing to dispel conceptions of beauty and purity.
[F.63.a]

28. 4
“Noble one, the courtesan Vasumitrā is in her home, which is on the north
side of the city’s junction of three streets.”
28. 5
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, on hearing those words, was filled
with joy, delighted, elated, pleased, and happy. He went to the home of the
courtesan Vasumitrā. He saw that her house was huge and vast and
surrounded by ten successive precious walls. It was encircled by ten
successive rows of precious palm trees. It was encircled by ten successive
moats filled with water and covered with divine, precious red lotuses, blue
lotuses, night lotuses, and white lotuses; they were filled with water that
possessed the eight good qualities; they had bottoms that were covered with
gold dust; they were filled with aromatic water mixed with beautiful scents;
and they were adorned by numerous precious fences.1210
28. 6
He saw well-arranged buildings, palaces, kūṭāgāras made from every
jewel with high
 pinnacles, toraṇas, round windows, lattices, crescents,
pavilions, shining banners, and so on, brilliant with various jewels. Her
house was beautified by walls
 of countless various jewels. Its floor was
formed of jewels inlaid with beryls. Its environs were perfumed by every
aromatic divine incense. It was perfumed by the aroma of supreme black
agarwood incense. Its environs were anointed with unguents. Rooftop
railings made of various jewels adorned the walls. It was covered above by
nets of Jambu River gold inlaid with various jewels. A hundred thousand
networks of hundreds of golden bells were ringing as they were moved by
the breeze, emitting a pleasant, beautiful sound. It was adorned by precious
flowers scattered and dispersed
 from clouds of flowers made from every
jewel. [F.63.b] The gateways were adorned by erected multicolored
banners made of all precious materials. The light from the brilliant shining of

various precious jewels shone outward without limit. There was an endless
treasure of a perfect multitude
 of hundreds of thousands of precious trees
of coral, diamonds, crystal, and so on,
 and it was beautified by ten parks.
1215
1216
28. 7
Sudhana saw there the courtesan Vasumitrā, who was beautiful, attractive,
and delightful to see. She was endowed with a magnificent, perfect color.
She had golden skin and deep black
 hair. Her limbs and smaller features
were all perfectly formed. She had a beautiful color, form, and shape that
were superior to those of all humans and devas of the desire realm. The
aspects of her voice were superior to those of Brahmā. She was skilled in the
languages of all beings. She had a beautiful voice that had the array of all
sounds.
 She possessed the skill of the liberation called the array of the wheel
of words. She had become skilled in all arts and treatises. She had trained to
become wise in illusions through Dharma wisdom. She had attained all the
methods and ways of the bodhisattvas. She had a beautiful body adorned by
various kinds of precious jewelry. Her body was adorned by a brightly
shining network of all jewels. Her body shone brightly, being adorned by an
array of jewelry made of countless divine precious jewels. She wore tied
upon her head a king of wish-fulfilling, supreme, precious jewels. She wore
at her throat a string of beryl jewels with its middle adorned by diamonds, a
multicolored beautiful lion, and precious jewels. [F.64.a]
1217
1218
28. 8
She had a beautiful assembly of followers that could not be divided, that
had a single aspiration and a similar share of the practice of the roots of
merit.
28. 9
She possessed an inexhaustible treasury of the treasure of the great
accumulations of merit and wisdom.
28. 10
Sudhana saw that all those buildings, the entire array of precious
dwellings and palaces, were illuminated and made bright by the light that
came from her body, which caused delight, physical pleasure and bliss, and
joy and happiness in the mind.
28. 11
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
courtesan Vasumitrā, stood before her with hands placed together in
homage, and said, “Āryā, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it. Āryā, I have
heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! I pray that
you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct and
how they should practice it!”
28. 12
Vasumitrā said, “Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation
called the complete attainment of freedom from desire.

28. 13
“Noble one, in this way I appear to the devas in accordance with their
wishes in the form, color, shape, and size of an apsaras with a brighter and
purer color. In the same way, I appear in accordance with their wishes in a
female form, color, shape, and size with a brighter and purer color to the
nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans,
and nonhumans. [F.64.b]
28. 14
“When beings whose minds are encircled by desire come before me, I
teach all of them the Dharma so that they will become free from desire. When
they hear the Dharma, they attain freedom from desire. They attain the
bodhisattva samādhi called the realm
 of nonattachment. Some become free
from desire the instant they see me, and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi
called joyfulness. Some become free from desire when they hold my hand, and
they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called going to and residing in all the
buddha realms. Some become free from desire when they are alone in my
company, and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called the light of
detachment. Some become free from desire just by gazing upon me, and they
attain the bodhisattva samādhi called the display of the form of peace. Some
become free from desire just by yawning, and they attain the bodhisattva
samādhi called the disarraying of adversaries. Some become free from desire just
by closing their eyes, and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called the light
of the buddha domains. Some become free from desire just by embracing me,
[F.65.a] and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called the essence of gathering
and not abandoning all beings. Some become free from desire just by kissing me,
and they attain the bodhisattva samādhi called touching the treasure of the merit
of all beings. In that way, I establish all the beings who come to me in the
bodhisattva liberation called the complete attainment of freedom from desire and the
manifestation of the attachment-free level of omniscience.”
1219
28. 15
Sudhana asked, “Āryā, what roots of merit did you develop? What kinds
of activities did you accumulate so that you have attained this kind of
perfection?”
Vasumitrā replied, “Noble one, I remember that in a past time, there had
appeared in the world a tathāgata, an arhat, a samyak saṃbuddha, one with
wisdom and conduct,
 a sugata, one who knows the world’s beings, an
unsurpassable guide who tames beings, a teacher of devas and humans, a
buddha, a bhagavat named Atyuccagāmin.
1220
28. 16
“The Tathāgata Atyuccagāmin, because of his love for beings, went to the
capital city named Sumukhā. When he placed his foot upon the threshold of
its gateway, the entire city shook and became huge, vast, and made of many
jewels. In the sky above, there was the light of a display of many jewels; it


---

was filled with various precious flowers, emitted the sound of various divine
musical instruments, and was pervaded by vast, measureless clouds of deva
bodies. [F.65.b]
28. 17
“Noble one, at that time, I was the wife of a head merchant, and my name
was Sumati. Inspired by the miracles of the Buddha,
 my spouse and I ran
and came to the Tathāgata in a street in the middle of the city. Developing a
fast faith, I offered to him one precious bell.
1221
1222
28. 18
“At that time, Mañjuśrī Kumāra bhūta was an attendant of the Bhagavat,
the Tathāgata Atyuccagāmin. Through him I developed the aspiration to the
highest, complete enlightenment.
28. 19
“Noble one, I know only this bodhisattva liberation called the complete
attainment of freedom from desire. How could I know the conduct or describe the
qualities of those bodhisattvas
 who dwell in infinite method and wisdom,
who have a vast, immense treasure of merit, and who are invincible in their
scope of wisdom?
1223
28. 20
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region there is a city called
Śubhapāraṃgama. There dwells a householder by the name of Veṣṭhila who
makes offerings to a sandalwood chair that is a tathāgata shrine. Go to him
and ask him, ‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How
should a bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
28. 21
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, bowed his head to the feet of the
courtesan Vasumitrā, circumambulated the courtesan Vasumitrā many
hundreds of thousands of times, keeping her to his right, and, looking back
again and again, departed from the courtesan Vasumitrā.
