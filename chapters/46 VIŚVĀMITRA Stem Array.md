Chapter 46
VIŚVĀMITRA
46. 1
Sudhana descended from the paradise of the lord of Trāyastriṃśa and
eventually came to Viśvāmitra, the teacher of children, in the city of
Kapilavastu. When he came to him, he bowed his head to the feet of
Viśvāmitra, the teacher of children; circumambulated Viśvāmitra, the teacher
of children, many hundreds of thousands of times, keeping him to his right;
and then stood before Viśvāmitra, the teacher of children, with his palms
together in homage and said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the
highest, complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas
should train in bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it.
Ārya, I have heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas!
Ārya, I pray that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it!” [F.273.b]
46. 2
When he had said that, Viśvāmitra, the teacher of children, said to
Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, “Noble one, Śilpābhijña, a head
merchant’s son here, has studied the knowledge of words from bodhisattvas.
You should go to him and ask him, and he will teach you how bodhisattvas
should train in bodhisattva conduct and how they should practice it.”
