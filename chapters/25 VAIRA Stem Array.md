VAIRA
25. 1
When Sudhana set out on the path to Kūṭāgāra, he observed and
contemplated how the path could be upward or downward, even or
uneven,
 dusty or free of dust, safe or hazardous,
 difficult or
unobstructed, and crooked or straight. He thought, “This journey to a
kalyāṇamitra will be a cause for the practice of the bodhisattva path, will be a
cause of the practice of the path of the perfections, and will be a cause of the
path of benefiting all beings,
 which will be a cause for turning all beings
away from the precipice of attachment
 and aversion, [F.49.a] of elation
and depression;
 will be a cause for turning all beings away from a
perception
 of inequality; will be a cause for removing the dust of the
kleśas from all beings; will be a cause for clearing away the tree trunks,
thorns, pebbles, and gravel of the various bad views of all beings; and,
through their entering the unobscured realm of the Dharma, will be a cause
for bringing them without hindrance to the palace of omniscience.

“Why is that? Because the kalyāṇamitras are the source of all good
Dharmas, and the attainment of omniscience is dependent on the
kalyāṇamitras.”
25. 3
With his mind focused on those thoughts, and undergoing a difficult
journey, he eventually arrived at the city of Kūṭāgāra. He looked and
searched for the mariner Vaira and saw him at the shore of the ocean in front
of the gate of the great city. He was encircled by a hundred thousand
merchants and many hundreds of thousands of people who all wished to
listen to his various tales. As he told them tales of the sea, he was teaching
the beings about the ocean of qualities of the buddhas.
25. 4
When Sudhana saw the mariner Vaira, he approached him. Having
approached him, Sudhana bowed his head to the mariner Vaira’s feet,
circumambulated the mariner Vaira many hundreds of thousands of times,
and sat down before the mariner Vaira. With his hands placed together in

homage, he said, “Ārya, I have developed the aspiration for the highest,
complete enlightenment, but I do not know how bodhisattvas should train in
bodhisattva conduct and in what way they should practice it. Ārya, I have
heard that you give instruction and teachings to bodhisattvas! [F.49.b] I pray
that you explain to me how bodhisattvas should train in bodhisattva conduct
and how they should practice it!”
25. 5
Vaira said, “Noble one, it is excellent, excellent, that you have developed
the aspiration for the highest, complete enlightenment, that you have asked
about the cause of
 great wisdom, the cause of the continuity of the
various sufferings of saṃsāra, the cause of journeying to the island of
omniscience, the cause of the indivisible Mahāyāna, the cause of the practice
of the path that is free from the fear of falling down to the level of the
śrāvakas and pratyeka buddhas, the cause of the path of knowledge that
comprehends engaging in the gateways of various
 samādhis of peace,
the cause of the pure
 and unimpeded path of the wheels of the chariot of
the aspiration to the practice of all-pervasive bodhisattva conduct, the cause
of the pure path of the way that is the nature of the display of all the majestic
waves of bodhisattva conduct, the cause of the pure ultimate path of all the
aspects and gateways of the Dharma, and the cause that gives rise to the
pure path for entering the ocean of omniscience.

25. 6
“Noble one, I dwell at the city of Kūṭāgāra on the seashore, purifying the
bodhisattva conduct called the banner of great compassion.
25. 7
“Noble one, when I see destitute beings in Jambudvīpa, I undergo
hardships for their sake, which means I will fulfill all their wishes. I will
collect worldly goods for them. I will satisfy them with the enjoyment of the
Dharma. I will teach them the instructions for the path of the accumulation of
merit. I will cause them to increase their accumulation of wisdom. [F.50.a] I
will increase the power of their roots of merit. I will cause them to develop
the aspiration for enlightenment. I will purify their aspiration for
enlightenment. I will cause them to have the enduring strength of great
compassion. I will cause the suffering of saṃsāra to cease. I will cause them
to have an enduring strength for tireless conduct in saṃsāra. I will provide
these to the gathering of an ocean of beings. I will bring them into the
gateways of the practice of an ocean of qualities. I will cause them to obtain
the light of the wisdom of the ocean of the Dharma. I will cause them to
see
 the entire ocean of buddhas. I will cause them to enter the ocean of
omniscience.
1105
25. 8
“Noble one,
 it is with such an aspiration and intention that I dwell in
the city of Kūṭāgāra on the seashore.

25. 9
“Noble one, dedicated in that way to the benefit and happiness of beings,
I know all the islands of jewels in the great ocean. I know all the jewel mines,
all the classes of jewels, and all the sources
 of jewels.
1107
25. 10
“I know all the residences of the nāgas, all that disconcerts the nāgas, all
the residences of the yakṣas, all that disconcerts the yakṣas, all the
residences of the rākṣasas, all that allays fear of the rākṣasas, all the
residences of the bhūtas, all that allays fear of the bhūtas, and all that
eliminates the obstacles created by the bhūtas.
“I know all whirlpools,
 the avoidance
 of whirlpools, and the
avoidance of great waves.
1108
1109
25. 11
“I know the orbits of the sun, moon, planets, and constellations and the
seconds, minutes, and hours
 of
 the days and nights.
1110
1111
“I know the particular times to depart and arrive, safety and danger,
whether a ship’s rigging is reliable, what ships to reject, what ships to sail,
[F.50.b] how to catch the winds, the coming of the wind, how to turn a ship,
how to turn a ship around,
 how to anchor a ship, and how to launch a
ship.
1112
25. 12
“Noble one, with that kind of knowledge I am constantly dedicated to
necessary benefits
 for beings: I bring a group of merchants, just as they
wish, to the island of jewels safely,
 peacefully,
 without fear, and in a
reliable ship, and I talk to them about the Dharma in a way that delights
them and brings them joy. When they have collected all the jewels and have
attained good fortune, I bring them back again to Jambudvīpa.
1113
1114
1115
25. 13
“Noble one, no ship of mine has ever been in distress.
 Any being who
sees me and any being who hears me teach the Dharma becomes free from
all
 fear of sinking
 in the ocean of saṃsāra, and they turn toward
the wisdom of entering the ocean of omniscience. They become dedicated to
drying up the ocean of craving, attain the light of the knowledge of the
ocean of the three times, and make the aspiration to eliminate the ocean of
the suffering of all beings. They become dedicated to purifying away the
pollution in the ocean of the minds of all beings. They become dedicated to
purifying the ocean of all realms. They never turn back from spreading
throughout the ocean of all directions. They comprehend the ocean of the
different capabilities of all beings. They follow the ocean of the conducts of
all beings. They manifest appearances that accord with the ocean of the
wishes of all beings.
1116
1117
1118
1119
25. 14
“Noble one, I have attained the bodhisattva liberation called remembering to
abide with the fruitful
 hearing and seeing of the banner of great compassion,
[F.51.a] but how could I know the conduct or describe the qualities of the
bodhisattvas who act within all the oceans of saṃsāra, who are unstained by
any of the oceans of saṃsāra, who are free from the fear of the makaras of

attachment
 in all the oceans of false views, who move among the nature
and basis
 of all phenomena, who possess an ocean
 of the methods of
gathering all the oceans of beings, who dwell within the ocean of
omniscience, who churn the ocean of the attachments of all beings, who
perform their conduct
 without differentiation
 in the oceans of all
times, who have the clairvoyant knowledge of the nature
 of ripening the
ocean of all beings, and who never miss the time
 for guiding the ocean of
beings?

25. 15
“Depart, noble one. In this southern region, in the town called Nandihāra,
dwells a head merchant by the name of Jayottama. Go to him and ask him,
‘How should a bodhisattva train in bodhisattva conduct? How should a
bodhisattva practice it?’ ”
25. 16
Then Sudhana, the head merchant’s son, was overjoyed, pleased, happy,
and content. He bowed his head to the feet of the mariner Vaira,
circumambulated the mariner Vaira many hundreds of thousands of times,
keeping him to his right, and, looking back again and again, departed from
the mariner Vaira. [B4]
