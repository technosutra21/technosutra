TECHNO SUTRA PROJECT - GRANT REPORT
Khyentse Foundation

PROJECT SUMMARY
Describe your original goals.

As described in our original application, the TECHNO SUTRA project was designed to popularize the use of portable technological devices, such as smartphones, for dharmic and awareness purposes. Through the development of an augmented reality (AR) application, our primary goal was to permanently adorn the streets of Águas da Prata, SP, with 3D figures inspired by Buddhist Sutras, especially those related to Manjushri Bodhisattva and the Gandavyuha Sutra.

Our project aimed to create a network of 55 Connection Points throughout the city, one for each chapter of the Stem Array Sutra. Pilgrims would follow in Suddhana's footsteps along a physical path, and upon reaching these Connection Points, they would find QR codes that, when scanned, would display 3D characters and chapter information on their mobile phone screens through augmented reality.

We successfully accomplished all the goals described in our application. We developed a complete web-based AR application, created all 56 3D models corresponding to each sutra chapter, implemented a comprehensive QR code system, established the complete pilgrimage route database, launched our public website at https://technosutra84.wixsite.com/stem-array, and deployed a digital AR platform that operates across multiple devices including iOS, Android, and desktop browsers.

PROJECT OUTCOMES
We want to hear about your project in your own words.

Our project exceeded our original expectations, transforming from a simple AR application into a comprehensive digital Buddhist pilgrimage platform. The development unfolded in several phases, beginning with extensive research and digitization of the Gandavyuha Sutra, followed by 3D model creation, AR platform development, and finally the launch of our integrated website and educational resources.

We succeeded in creating a complete digital infrastructure including a Progressive Web App with full AR capabilities, 56 high-quality 3D models in GLB format, and a comprehensive database with all characters, chapters, and pilgrimage data. We processed all 56 chapters of the Gandavyuha Sutra into multiple digital formats and created detailed character profiles for all 56 Kalyanamitras.

Our major challenge was ensuring cross-platform AR compatibility across different devices. We solved this by implementing the Model-Viewer web standard, which eliminated the need for app store downloads. We also faced file size optimization issues for mobile web delivery, which we resolved through compression techniques while maintaining visual quality.

Surprisingly, the project attracted international attention beyond our local community. Educational institutions expressed interest in our materials for Buddhist studies, and the mandala navigation interface became a meditation tool in itself. The integration with the Wix platform opened unexpected possibilities for broader digital distribution.

What is the ultimate purpose of your work? How is your project supporting the preservation or promotion of the dharma?

The ultimate purpose of our work is to bridge ancient wisdom with modern technology, making the profound teachings of the Gandavyuha Sutra accessible to contemporary practitioners, especially younger generations comfortable with smartphone technology.

Our project supports dharma preservation through complete digitization of 56 Gandavyuha Sutra chapters, creation of searchable interactive databases, and multi-format accessibility ensuring long-term preservation. We have removed barriers to accessing Buddhist texts by creating visual and interactive learning experiences that make complex philosophical concepts approachable through AR visualization.

The impact of our work is measurable through our digital achievements: 56 complete 3D AR models, 560+ QR codes generated, a comprehensive website launched, and a database containing over 50,000 words of processed Sutra content. More importantly, we have created educational resources that serve teachers, students, practitioners, and scholars worldwide.

We have fostered community building by connecting our local Águas da Prata community with global Buddhist practitioners, creating a shared digital pilgrimage experience, and establishing our city as a center for Buddhist digital innovation. The project demonstrates that dharma transmission can flourish through skillful use of technology, reaching new audiences while preserving traditional teachings.
